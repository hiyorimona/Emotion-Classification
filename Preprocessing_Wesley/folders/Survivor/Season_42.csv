I actually work as a therapist.,neutral
But usingwhat I know in therapy,neutral
is totally what I'm going to do.,neutral
"Are we, like,the three young people?",surprise

"So we quickly start working on our shelter,",neutral
"and the big kids go to deal with the fire,",fear

You can't do anythingwithout those three.,anger
"So big decision, we're in trouble.",fear
"Either we solve this puzzle, or fill up that pot",neutral
and walk that back and forth for four hours,neutral

"Now, looking around,",surprise
I saw that the person thatwould be designated to do that,neutral
was yours truly.,neutral
"And they get to talk,",neutral

so that I can get us the tools that we need.,neutral
There's no way.,sadness
It almost seems too easy.,surprise
"Six, seven, eight.",neutral

"Ultimately,the tribe decided to do Savvy,",neutral
which is a puzzle.,surprise
"I wanted to be the provider, the strength,",neutral
but I'm not gonna bethe puzzle guy.,neutral
"So, as a tribe, we decided to split--",sadness
"half work on the puzzle,half work on the shelter.",neutral
And then there were three.,surprise
The hardest part about this puzzle,disgust

Thirty-one.,neutral
"Okay, I see...",neutral
"No, no. The 30 is the 30.That 30 is that...",neutral

Rocksroy has taken on the most leader-like role...,happiness
Line 'em up like this.,neutral
...that through 40 odd seasons,neutral
I have ever seen in this game.,surprise
- I just need to sit for a minute.- Just sit.,neutral
"And in a new era of Survivor,",surprise
it paints a huge targeton your back,fear

Let me knowif I'm being too lecture-y.,anger
"Generations have changed,you know?",neutral
It's kind of a little frustrating 'cause,anger
my kids are a lot more easierto take care of than these guys.,anger
I am a stay-at-home dad.,happiness
"You know, I love it.",happiness
My kids are seven and five.,happiness
"It's such a joy, like,",happiness
"just being there with the kidsall the time,",happiness
"watching them grow, watching them develop.",happiness
It's such a different mindset,surprise

And then when you're put in this situation with,neutral
"adults, which you don't need to teach them all the time,",anger
it is a reset with my brain.,surprise

I just don't care.,sadness
Okay.,neutral
Cool.,neutral
Hide it in my pants.,fear
I kind of overestimated this advantage,sadness
because the catch is really,neutral
crippling.,sadness
Not only do I have to reconnect,neutral
with Lindsay and Drea to use this thing.,neutral
I also have to consider whether or not,neutral
"I need to take them out, because",fear
this thing becomesmore powerful.,surprise
But they're thinkingthe same thing.,surprise

My goal is to getto the million dollars.,happiness

Jonathan's starting to unravel.,sadness
And people are picking upon that.,anger
It's perfect timing because,happiness

he gets annoyed with me.,anger
Mm-hmm.,neutral

"If you lose, you're out,and that's it.",fear
"Oh!Nothing can protect you,",fear
"no idols, no advantage,no Shot in the Dark, nothing.",anger
It is you against the game.,neutral

"and observe, like,how they're moving,",neutral
"how they're acting, who they're talking to.",neutral
It's weird. It's a very weird vibe.,surprise
"Mike is saying that it's Romeo,",neutral
but now my gut tells me that Mike is lying to me.,anger
So... is the plan,neutral
- -- Romeo?  Mm-hmm.,neutral
-Yes. And then,neutral
"we have to try to get Miketo play his immunity idol,",fear
basically.,neutral
I'm gonna takehis immunity idol.,anger
- You can take it?- Yes.,neutral
- Really?- Mm-hmm.,surprise
You can take it from him?,fear
"- You're the only person I've told, Omar.- Okay.",neutral
"- You're literally the only person I've told.- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",neutral
"It's before the votes.I have to say, ""Hey, Jeff.""",neutral
- It's public?- Yeah.,neutral
Mike does not know,surprise
that I havethe Knowledge Is Power,neutral
and have the abilityto take his idol tonight.,surprise
"I decided to tell Omar, because I believe",neutral
Omar is someone that I can workwith towards the finish line.,happiness
Mike told methat he might play it today.,neutral
- His immunity idol?- Yeah.,surprise
So...,neutral
we may have to vote Mike today.,fear

"It's the perfect timeto take him out,",anger
'cause he won't see it coming.,surprise
"And with Drea stealing his idol,",anger
he has no backup protection.,fear
He told me that it's you.,surprise
'Cause he willnever see that coming.,surprise
- It would be epic.- I agree.,happiness
"This is big,because Drea told me her power.",surprise
"So, like, we can't let it spill.",fear
"So, she will steal Mike'shidden immunity idol tonight,",surprise
and she wants to blindside Mike.,anger
Whoa.,surprise
So Mike's hidden immunity idol,surprise
will be Drea's tonight.,neutral
Wow.,surprise
"Oh, my God. This is crazy.",surprise
"Yeah, for sure.",neutral

"Because we can blindside Mikeand get him out,",surprise
or--telling him what the power is--,neutral
Mike gives us the idol.,surprise
"And this way, we still havecontrol of where the idol is.",neutral
"By removing the idol from Mike'spocket and putting it in mine,",neutral
Drea's advantageis basically neutered,sadness
and so is Mike's'cause he doesn't have his idol.,sadness
"And then it's, like, free for the taking.",surprise
You can take either one out.,anger
- My gut says to take out Mike.- My gut says...,anger
"I know, but my gut saysI don't trust Drea as much.",fear
And there's so many waysthat I could go.,neutral
"We let Drea steal Mike's idol,",anger
"he's blindsided, and Mike goes home.",surprise
- It's gonna be cool. Okay.- I know.,neutral
Or tell Mike about the advantage,neutral
and then blindside Drea to keep him happy.,anger
He's an ally.,neutral
He's a vote.,neutral
"The other option is,if I keep his idol in my pocket",neutral
"and vote out Mike,",anger
then I don't have to give it back to him.,anger
"Officially,possession of the idol is mine.",neutral
I can't wait. Dude.,surprise
And yet none of this may matter.,sadness
"Lindsay may go homein the Do or Die,",surprise

you were the only other person,neutral
"that stood upand said ""I'm competing.""",surprise
"Honestly, my competitive nature",neutral
"overtook my gut,and I made a poor choice.",sadness
And I was blindedwithout double-checking,fear
does this make sensein the game to do?,neutral
"Mike, what was it liketo watch these two?",surprise
Because it wasa pretty intense battle.,surprise
Their bodies gave out.,sadness
It was unbelievable.I got to be honest with you.,surprise
I have total respectfor both of them.,neutral

"Whatever happens tonight,Lindsay's gonna be fine.",happiness
She's a remarkable young woman.,happiness
She's gonna be successfulthrough life.,happiness
And what she did today,neutral
"just showed the kind of personthat she really is,",anger
and that's who I can respect.,neutral
"And then also,",neutral
Lindsay and Jonathan havealways been head-to-head,anger
every single competition.,neutral
"So Lindsay goingand stepping up,",neutral
I don't think wasa bad decision,neutral
based on the track record.,neutral
"And, like, I hope that,",happiness
"however this turns out, that youdon't lose that competitiveness,",neutral
because that's a good traitto have.,neutral
"- And I want you to know that, okay?- Thank you.",happiness
I appreciate that. Thank you.,happiness
"Omar, was it hardfor you to sit out",neutral
from a competitionpoint of view?,neutral
"I was sitting on the benchwatching them, very impressed,",surprise
"but also happy with the decisionthat I made, because I grew up,",happiness
"my parents were like, ""You getan education, and that's it.",anger
"You don't, you don't go to gym class. I don't care.""",anger
"So, you know,that's not my strength",neutral
to go up against these two.,fear
"All right,so you get back to camp.",neutral
"Maryanne, what's the vibe?",neutral
"Because you can't""kind of"" approach it",anger
"like there might be a vote,'cause there might be a vote,",surprise
depending on what happenswith Do or Die.,fear
"The scrambling always starts,you know?",surprise
"And there's some peoplewho are going in,",neutral
they're pullingmany people aside.,surprise
There's some peoplewho are just like...,disgust
And then it's the head nod planor the scramble plan,neutral
that goes tonight if...,surprise
And if it even happens.,neutral
"So, Mike, does that mean",surprise
that there are literallydifferent ways,neutral
of communicatingfor different plans,neutral
within different alliances?,neutral
Absolutely.,neutral
It's either... or it's...,surprise
"But if you see this one,get to the water well.",fear
"You see this one, just relax.",happiness
So you kind of knowthe winks and the nods.,surprise
"Drea, when you seethe sign Mike talked about,",anger
"which is, you know, 911,",surprise
how do you react in the moment?,surprise
"I see who he's looking at,and I observe.",surprise
Just like I seewhen Jonathan gets up,neutral
and tries to talk to numerouspeople throughout the day.,neutral
And I observe.,neutral
"And I see when numerous peoplego to the water well,",neutral
and they come back andtheir canteens are still empty.,sadness
I observe.,neutral
"When they go for wood,",neutral
but there's no wood in their hands.,surprise
I observe.,neutral
"Omar, it was almost gettinglike a horror movie,",fear
"the way she's, ""I've been watching you.""Yeah. Yeah.",surprise
It's a creepy vibe.,fear
"Like, all of a sudden,you introduce this twist,",surprise
and now we can't justassume Lindsay's going home.,fear
Somebody else may be going home.,fear
"Today was the most paranoidI've ever seen people,",fear
"and it's weird, 'causewe might not even have a vote.",surprise
"Jonathan, what kind of energy",neutral
"did you feel, knowingthat you were safe tonight?",surprise
"When people talk to you,it's a whole different level,",neutral
"because they look at youand go, ""Well, Jonathan's safe.",surprise
"So I can tell him moreor I can do more.""",neutral
They work with you more.,neutral
"Drea, that's really interesting,because if somebody",neutral
were to tell Jonathanmore than they might normally--,neutral
"because tonight he's safe--and there is no vote,",happiness
then Jonathan just gotall this free information.,neutral
Him havingwhatever information he has,neutral
doesn't change my gameplay.,neutral
I didn't come into Survivorto just depend on other people,anger
to help me get through.,neutral
"Alliances are there,",neutral
"but alliances alsoflip on people, as we see.",fear
So I play like it's my last day.,happiness
"Listen, everything you sayin this game to somebody",anger

"And you say, like,""I didn't mean that at all.""",anger
"Omar, that's alsovery interesting,",surprise
in that Mike is saying sometimes,neutral
"you could say something wrong,even unintentionally.",fear
"Yeah, I mean, that's alsowhy you have to be careful",fear
"with the winks and the nods,",neutral
'cause peoplemight get the wrong idea.,fear
"And sometimes,you need to know when to stop.",neutral
"Because, like Mike said,",neutral
"""You keep going, you're gonnarun out into the train tracks",fear
"and get run over.""",fear
"All right,before we go to the vote,",neutral

And I'm really sorryfor the two I don't choose.,sadness
"All right,so you're going to take",neutral
"chocolate cake and cookies,and you're going to bring",happiness
"three people with you,which means",surprise
two will not participatein this.,neutral
"There's one person herewho's eaten nothing,",neutral
so I can't not pick Romeo.,happiness
"Good job, Romeo.Yeah!",happiness
"Come on over, Romeo.Yeah, Romeo.",surprise
The second personI'm gonna pick is Maryanne.,neutral

there's no backlashto the decision I made.,neutral
Wow.Wow.,surprise

and Lindsay chose mefor the other one.,surprise
"But I was like""I'm just trying to be fair.""",anger
"At this point, Mike and Jonathan are",neutral
two very open targets that I want out of the game.,anger
So leaving Jonathan behind at camp was,sadness
"maybe to deprive hima little bit,",neutral
make him less energeticfor tomorrow's challenge,anger
'cause I need to beat him.,anger
"No, I'm not bitter at all.I understand the reason.",neutral
He's going to tryto get them comfortable.,neutral
- Mm-hmm.- And then blindside Mike is the plan.,surprise
That's what I'm thinking.,neutral
"I didn't getany confirmation on that,",neutral
but I assumethat would be the plan.,neutral
"When Lindsay and I arediscussing the vote over rice,",neutral
we are obviously trying to fool each other.,anger
"And right nowMike and I are very tight, but",neutral
I don't think Lindsay reallywants to vote for Mike. No.,anger
I think she would much rathervote me out,anger
because I'm a bigger threat when it comes to challenges.,anger
"So I'm just trying to get her comfortable,",neutral
and she's trying to get me comfortable.,happiness
"Hopefully, I'm doinga better job than she's doing",anger
- I'm gonna lay down.- Okay.,neutral

"I'm telling you, if it's...",anger
"If Jonathan doesn't win,you are safe.",anger
Am I feeling safe? Absolutely not.,fear
I have to go with my gut.My gut says,neutral
Omar is now gunning for me.,fear
- You are the next biggest threat after Jonathan.- Okay.,neutral
That-that's how some peoplefeel. Me and Omar don't.,sadness
And Lindsay-- she's playing the game with-with Omar.,neutral
I can't be 100%,fear

her-her amulet becamea full idol.,surprise
You... How long canyou-you... you can use...?,surprise
Okay.,neutral

that Lindsay has an idol and,surprise
make sure they're on my side.,fear
Uh-uh.,neutral
Mm-hmm.,neutral
Mm-hmm.,neutral
Anybody has to win this one except for Lindsay,anger

to play his idolfor me at the final five.,surprise
But I already have an idol.,neutral

"This means that I'm double safe, so",neutral
I'm on for this plan for Omar.,neutral
"Like, we have to get him outas soon as we can,",fear
and that meansat the next vote.,neutral
"And even if he wins immunity,we still have the votes.",anger
"Right. Who...?Yeah, who do we go for then?",surprise

"Uh, Jonathan's on our side.",surprise
"Then Lindsay? 'Cause, look...",neutral
"No, Lindsay has immunity.",neutral
Lindsay has immunity?,surprise
- For final six?- Yes. It's only good till final six.,surprise
No.,neutral
"So, Mike tells me that Lindsay has some sort",neutral
"of amulet,which is a hidden immunity idol.",surprise
"So that means that, like,I'm out of the loop with her.",neutral

because I thought we were close.,sadness
But basically I'm justlike a sacrificial lamb to her.,sadness
that my move that I've beenthinking about won't be ruined,happiness

then Mike and I are the biggest targets.,fear
So Mike and Iare gonna vote Romeo.,neutral
Just coconut is the only thingthat's been in here.,neutral
"Jonathan thinks that Mike is going home,",neutral
"but all of us have been thinking that if Jonathan loses,",fear
he is leaving tonight.,sadness
So that is the planthat I hope to just sink in.,happiness
- Jonathan needs to go.- Okay.,neutral
- Jonathan's a huge liability to stay.- Exactly.,anger
"Like, the fact thathe didn't win today",sadness
"- was, like...- We have to take that opport...",surprise
"We have to.- Okay, yeah. So...",neutral
I don't see why,anger
anyone would veer off fromthis plan to vote Jonathan out.,anger
Yes.,neutral
"Like, that has to...That's, like, a no-brainer.",surprise
Jonathan has been a target since early on.,fear
I've been on the chopping block every Tribal Council.,fear
"So it only makes sense to get rid of him,",anger
because thenthe backup person would be who?,surprise
Most likely me.,neutral
...are 100% on Jonathan.,neutral
"- So you need to be on Jonathan, too.- Okay. Okay.",neutral
"We're heading intoTribal Council in a few hours,",fear

Yeah.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Tonight, if anything is crazy,",surprise
"I do have my amulet,which is a hidden immunity idol.",surprise
"But I'd rather not play it,",disgust
"because once somebody plays an idol,",surprise
it usually goes right back out for somebody to find.,neutral
And we don't wantto worry about an idol,neutral
being back in circulationon the island.,happiness
"Yeah, okay. Jonathan will be out as planned,",neutral
and then me and Omar have a nice,happiness
cruising out to final fourand make it to the end.,happiness
"Right now, I'm feeling thatOmar can win this whole thing.",surprise
And that's not a feeling that I want to have.,sadness
Flame on.,anger
"I feel dejected,",sadness
but I want to show that I'm here,neutral
"to play my game, and I'm here to win.",anger
I have my extra vote.,neutral
I can go with Omar and Lindsay's plan,neutral
and use my extra vote,neutral
"the way they want me to,or I can go with my plan",neutral
and use my extra vote the way I want to.,anger
So there's a chancethat this plan to take out Omar,fear
- can still happen. - Listen to me.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"This is our time to take a risk,but a big move.",fear
"- Okay. Okay.- This is what you're going to do, okay?",neutral
"You're going to tell Jonathan,""Vote Omar.""",neutral
Then...,surprise
- I know for a fact Jonathan is voting Romeo with me.- Mm-hmm.,neutral
"- Okay.- And if you throw two votes Romeo, and I vote Romeo,",neutral
there's nothing anybody can do.,sadness
"Omar's next one. He has no,he has no protection.",fear
"- It's me, you...- But what if he wins tomorrow?",fear
I want to vote for Omar.,neutral
"I could use my idol tonight, but",sadness
it's not gonna happen.,sadness
I need my idol tomorrowto make sure that I get to four.,neutral
It's my life. My life's hangingon the balance.,fear
I'm putting my lifein your hands. Please.,fear
I can't promise you right now.,sadness
I still need to think about it.That's the thing.,neutral
Lindsay wins the immunity challenge.,happiness
She doesn't needher immunity idol.,surprise
I'm thinking Lindsay gives Omar her immunity idol.,surprise
It would make them both safe.,neutral
"So the easy thing is, put four votes on Romeo.",neutral
"Simple, except Maryanne",neutral
"wants to play Survivor 18.0, instead of 2.0.",happiness
And having my fate in her hands,fear
is scary.,fear
"- But you're not voting for me, right?- I'm not.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
- I'm not.- Okay.,neutral
"Like, I gave you my word,and I'm keeping my word.",neutral
"Okay. Mike is just trying to play it safe,",neutral
'cause people can feel the final five.,surprise
"And when people can feel it, and they don't have",neutral
"that necklace on their neck, they get paranoid.",fear
"But I have my extra vote,",neutral
and my two votesgive me a lot of power tonight.,happiness
Nothing from thisconversation can leak.,fear
- Nothing.- I swear.,neutral
- We have six votes.- Yes.,neutral
"- Oh, my God.- Used... And it has to be used this Tribal.",surprise
So that meansthat us four are five votes.,surprise
This is what we need to do.,neutral
"Me, you, Jonathan, Mike",neutral
"vote Omar,because Omar will win.",anger
"I think I have Romeo on board, but I still have",neutral
a lot of work to do.,neutral
- This is simple.- Mm-hmm.,neutral
You two do Romeo.,neutral
Romeo and I do Omar.,neutral
- That is three.- You do your two?,surprise
"Yeah, I will do two on Omar.",neutral
"- Okay, do we trust Romeo to vote Omar?- Okay.",neutral
I do. I've talked to him.I literally trust him.,happiness
I'm not confident in Romeo at all.,fear
And he's been very back and forth,neutral
throughout the whole game.,neutral
"And if he votes me, then I could go home.",surprise
So I thinkit would be a dumb move,anger
not to vote out Romeo.,anger
So here's my question.,neutral
Is it best we just go alongwith whatever they say,surprise
"to all of us,",neutral
and we silentlythrow our votes on Romeo?,anger
"Then we're all guaranteedto be here tomorrow,",neutral
and then we get Omartomorrow night.,surprise
"- And then, and then... no, no, listen to me.- Oh, my God.",surprise
Jonathan and Mike are underestimating me.,anger
"I'm trying to play a good move to take out Omar,",anger
- and they're just not getting it.- Look.,anger
"If we all vote for Romeo,Romeo is gone,",anger
but then our way to the endis more difficult.,neutral
This is a riskthat we have to take.,fear
"I'm going guns blazing to go and make my move on Omar,",anger
but I am getting frustrated,anger
because I got to make moveshappen for me to get to the end.,neutral
"And the only wrench in my plan,",sadness
"if I don't get guys who are literally, like,",neutral
"a foot taller than me to go and listen to me,",neutral
then my whole planis just gonna go up in smoke.,sadness
All right.,neutral
Let's get into it. Wow.,surprise
I can feel intensity tonight.,surprise
You were alllooking at me like this.,surprise
"Omar, is that just being eager,or was it a crazy day?",surprise
Or are you anticipatingthe rain? What is it?,surprise
I think it'sa little bit of the fact,neutral
that last Tribal Councilwas outrageous.,anger
And then we're alsodreading the rain that's coming,fear
"and wondering, is this Tribalgonna be outrageous?",surprise
"Well, I will say,just since you've sat down,",neutral
the rain hasincreased in intensity,fear
"by about fourfold, right, Mike? You can feel it. Oh.",surprise
Of course.It's coming.,surprise
It matches the intensityof the place.,surprise
"Quite frankly, I'm at the pointnow, this is past calculus.",anger
"There's nowhere to hide,",fear
and there's only very few peopleyou can talk to.,sadness
"Romeo, you get back to camp.",neutral
Lindsay has her secondindividual immunity win.,happiness
You know she's not going home.,sadness
What was the feeling today?,neutral
I think the dynamicis changing a little bit.,neutral
I think people arestarting to think about,neutral
"who they might want to sitnext to in the final three,",neutral
as opposed to who they wantto vote off next.,anger
So it's different thinking.,surprise
"It's a different feel,and I think people are thinking",neutral
more long-termthan short-term now.,neutral
"Lindsay,do you concur with that?",neutral
That maybethe shift is happening?,surprise
Absolutely. He's-- was spot-on.,surprise
"Uh, like, at this point,",surprise
you're kind of figuring outwhat are my best odds,neutral
to feel the most comfortablein the final three.,neutral
"So then, Omar, what does that doin terms of who is the threat?",surprise
Who do I need to get out?,anger
"I don't know if I agreewith either of them,",neutral
to be honest.,neutral
I think people have beenplaying for the long-term game,neutral
since the beginning.,neutral
"Some of the people there,",neutral
"you know, they may havebeen trustworthy allies,",neutral
but people didn't wantto go to the end with them.,sadness
And that's why they're there.,neutral
So I thinkthat that trend will continue.,neutral
It's just thatthere's fewer people,neutral
and less room to hide now.,fear
"Maryanne,where do you sit on that?",neutral
Is there a shift happening?,surprise
I feel as if it depends,neutral
on where your positionwas in the tribe.,neutral
"If you're someonewho's on the bottom,",anger
"you might be thinking, ""No, Ihave to think self-preservation,",fear
"self-preservation.""And when you finally feel",fear
"a little bit more wiggle room,that's when you're like,",neutral
"""Okay, now I can thinkabout the endgame.""",neutral
"Lindsay, how confident are youabout tonight's vote?",surprise
I-I feel confidentin tonight's vote,happiness
with the discussionsthat I've had.,neutral
So it's really more soif they feel equally,neutral
as confidentthat I was being honest,neutral
with what my discussion was.,neutral
"Mike, that'sa very honest answer",neutral
"to actually say, ""I'm good.",neutral
"""I don't know ifthe other people will trust me,",fear
"and if they don't,it might not go my way.""",fear
I-I live my life on trust.,sadness
"I trust who I put my, uh,fate in their hands",surprise
and their fate in my hands.,fear
I trust in who I believe in.,happiness
"Omar, what'd you readinto Lindsay's answer?",surprise
"I mean,I think that answer is...",neutral
just sums upthe game of Survivor.,surprise
You never know ifwhat you say to other people,fear
is gonna be taken with truthor with a falsity.,fear
"If I'm telling you something,and you don't believe me,",anger
then you couldchange everything up.,surprise
"So I'm Survivor confidentin what's gonna happen tonight,",surprise
"but every time you're Survivorconfident, you could be wrong.",fear
"So I'm open to that, too.",surprise
"So, Jonathan, if you're right,",surprise
"and the vote goes the wayyou want it to go,",neutral
what impact will it havewhen you guys get back to camp?,fear
"Like, if it works out,",neutral
"nobody lies, and everythingis all hunky-dory,",neutral
then that'll be the first Tribalwhere that's ever happened.,surprise
It's not that easy.,sadness
Something is happening wheresomebody's being lied to.,anger
"There is gonna be peoplethat keep their trust,",neutral
and there are gonna be peoplethat lie.,anger
"Lindsay, do you agree with that?",neutral
"I mean,unless it's a clean sweep,",neutral
"then, yeah, somebody elsewill definitely be upset.",sadness
"And usually, I don't thinkthere's been a clean sweep yet.",neutral
Mm-mm.,neutral
Not with the Shot in the Dark.,surprise
Why?,anger
"'Cause, like, you don't knowwho's gonna play it.",surprise
This is the last timewe can play it.,sadness
"And then, also,there's idols in this game, too.",surprise
"So then, after, if you're tryingto do a clean sweep, and then",neutral
"that person who you're doinga clean sweep for has an idol,",anger
"then you're up the river, too,'cause that person chooses.",anger
You can never doa clean sweep anymore.,sadness
"And, Omar, the tricky partabout that is,",neutral
"when there's onlysix people voting anyway,",neutral
"if you start splitting votes,it gets very scary.",fear

Exactly.No.,neutral
He gave me his word.,neutral
"He gave me his wordabout stuff, too,",neutral
and it means nothing.,sadness
Today was a challenge,sadness
that I absolutely needed to win.,neutral
So now the only possible way,neutral
that I'm going to get through this is to,neutral
vote for Jonathan--all three of us--,neutral
and hope that Mike,neutral
gives his idol to either myself or Maryanne.,neutral
He gave me his word that hewould play his idol for me.,surprise
Did he give you the same word?,neutral
He kind of said it to meon the beach that he might.,neutral
He didn't guarantee it.,neutral
"I really, truly do think",neutral
Jonathan won't be here tomorrow.,sadness
I have faith.,happiness
Maryanne is extremely confident that,neutral
Mike is goingto play his immunity idol,surprise
"for her, but I can't rely on that.",sadness
to make him feelextremely guilty,anger
that he'd be breaking his word if he didn't pick me.,anger
"So, I'm just begging",sadness
to not go home.,fear
"I valued how muchthat you feel like your word,",sadness
"as long as someone shows trustback, you show trust to them.",happiness
I feel like I very muchearned that with the trust,neutral
that I've given you.,neutral
"We had a bond--you, me, and Omar--",sadness
we're goingto make it to the end.,happiness
"Omar burned you,but I stayed true to my word,",sadness
"and you saying to me,""I would love to see you get",surprise
"- to the end.""- That's still true.",neutral
- But you have the power of that.- I know. Yeah.,neutral
"So if I leave,then it makes me feel",sadness
that that was a lie.,anger
It's not a lie.I still feel that way.,sadness
"Honestly, I love Lindsay.",happiness
I think she's a great girl. I really do.,happiness
I see my own daughter in her.,surprise
I think she got caught upin the wrong place,sadness
and with the wrong person.,sadness
"Other than that, she's been loyal to me.",neutral
"But on the other hand, it's fair",neutral
"that I protect Jonathan'cause he protected me,",happiness
and Maryanne has been a person of good character.,neutral
"She's kept her word,",neutral
and that means a lot to me.,happiness
I'm gonna tell you my dilemma.,neutral
When that happened with Omar,surprise
"- and-and you, I thought...- Mm-hmm.",surprise
...I went to Maryanne and made a promise to her.,neutral
"Then this is what's hardfor me, Mike,",sadness
because I feel likeI've proven myself to you,neutral
"in so many ways, and now,",neutral
because you now madea last-minute promise,fear
"to Maryanne, everythingthat I did meant ....",sadness
"No, that's not true.",anger
"Mike, look at me in my eyes.",surprise
I 100% never lied to you once.,anger
"I promise you, I swear",neutral
- on everything.- I believe you. Yeah.,neutral
I had your backand told you everything.,sadness
And this is your time,happiness
to-to show me the trust back.,sadness
I'm very torn. I...,sadness
I've put myself in a position where,fear
"hurt somebody,",anger
and it sucks.,sadness
I'm not 100% any way right now.,sadness
But now I got to figure out what's the right thing to do.,neutral
"Right, he's got to... You knowwhat, though? You're right.",surprise
But listen.,neutral
"I... Like, my mind says, like,I think I can squeeze it out.",neutral
"Right nowLindsay is a sitting duck, but",fear
"not only do I have my idol, which is",neutral
"the only secret that has beenkept in this entire game,",surprise
but also Mike might give his idol to me at Tribal.,surprise
So this means that my idol-- I can use it to save Lindsay,surprise
"and blindside Jonathan. The question is,",surprise
what gives me my best chance of winning?,surprise
"Emotionally, yes.",neutral
Lindsay's played such a great game.,happiness
"She's won immunities and taken major risks,",surprise
and the jury loves that.,happiness
But voting out someonewho knows they're going home--,anger
that's not a big move.,neutral
But if I play my idol,surprise
"on Lindsay and blindside Jonathan,",anger
the jury will knowthat I am here to play,neutral
and that I'm a contender.,happiness
"But it all comes down to what Mike does,",neutral
and this could make or break my game.,fear
Let's start this morning.,happiness
"Lindsay, you wake up,and you each have a riddle",happiness
to solve.Walk me through what happened.,neutral
"We each get this envelopethat says,",neutral
you haveto fix the word scramble.,anger
"Once you figure that out,",surprise
you're off to the racesto solve the riddle,surprise
and find a secret advantage.,surprise
And I was the only one,sadness
who solved the riddle.,surprise
- I-I had to have been gone for at least 40 minutes.- At least.,neutral
"Jonathan, it's gotto be frustrating",anger
because it's an advantage.,neutral
It's offering you somethingin the game,neutral
if you can just solve it.,neutral
"Yeah, that's the thing.",neutral
"I haven't felt normalin days, Mr. Jeff,",sadness
because of how hardthis has been.,sadness
It took four people.,neutral
"- Yeah.- No, we didn't get it.- And we still didn't get it.",neutral
"No, Lindsay hadto come back and tell us.",surprise
"Yeah. We said... we said,""Lindsay, can you tell us",neutral
"what it was?"" She's like,""Well, yeah, I got it now.""",neutral
"- It was ""sleeping.""- It was ""sleeping."" It was ""sleeping.""",neutral
"It was ""sleeping.""We look at the word.",neutral
"We said, ""We can't believeit was 'sleeping.'""",surprise
"So, Lindsay, you get",surprise
"the advantage, but did you feel,",neutral
"going into the challenge,",fear
that that advantagewould be helpful?,surprise
"Absolutely. I knewif I didn't win, I'm going home.",fear
And I was one puzzle piece short,sadness
from beating Mike.Super happy for Mike.,happiness
Really proud of himthat he got it.,happiness
"Just sucksthat in return of that,",anger
I'm most likely going home.,happiness
So what's giving youthat feeling?,surprise
"Based on last Tribal.Everyone else,",neutral
"apparently, already kind of knewthat Omar was working everybody.",anger
I didn't until afterwards.,surprise
"And then there was a lotof damage control to do,",disgust
"and some that wasn't ableto be repaired, it seems.",sadness
"Jonathan, then,what was the vibe at camp?",neutral
I thought it would be fireworks,surprise
with people running aroundeverywhere. Was it not?,fear
Is everybody locked inthat it's Lindsay?,surprise
"Uh, you can never knowfor sure,",surprise
"of course, because thencomfort sets in,",happiness
and we know thatthat kills people in this game.,fear
"But people do recognize Lindsayas a big threat, which she is.",anger
"Maryanne, what was your takeon what was going down at camp?",surprise
"In my perspective,I had to decide",neutral
on whether I wantedto vote emotionally,neutral
"on who I feelI want it to be in the end,",sadness
and strategically on whoI feel is the best combination,neutral
of people to have in the end.,neutral
"And everyone here knows thatI wear my heart on my sleeve,",neutral
so that was something thatwas difficult for me because,sadness
"I love every single person here,and I...",happiness
"but I need to go and recognizethat, like,",neutral
"I want to play this game for me,",neutral
and that meansthat I might have,neutral
"to, like, go back on my word,or, like, that means",anger
"that I might have to go backon an alliance, and that sucks.",sadness
"So, Lindsay, do you feel",neutral
that you were the only one thatwas openly feeling desperate?,sadness
- Yes.- So that was clear to everybody?,neutral
"Yeah, so it's calm",neutral
because no one hasto really make a decision.,neutral
It was more me havingto plead my case of why,neutral
"I would like to stay.I mean, on one end,",neutral
"I got deceived by Omarthis entire time,",sadness
"so my social game clearly sucks,strategic game sucks, because",sadness
all I haveis my competitive edge.,neutral
That's only one...That's one note.,neutral
"So, in terms of fightingagainst the jury,",anger
that's not really a big case.That's only one end of that.,neutral
"No, absolutely not.Every time Lindsay",anger
"communicates with people,they have a bond with her.",happiness
It's not justbecause you got tricked,anger
that makes youa bad social player at all.,anger
"You're social with everyone,and everyone loves you.",happiness
And that's the truth.,neutral
"And so, Lindsay,this is a question",neutral
I can never figure outwhat I would do.,surprise
"How do you stop trying?Because I'm sure, at some point,",sadness
"you go, ""Well, okay, I guessthat's it. But wait, Mike,",surprise
"let me just... Can I...? Let mejust try it one more time.""",surprise
- Is that what happened?- That's literally what I did.,surprise
- That's exactly what happened. Yes.- Okay.,neutral
"I'm doing it right now. Like,I have to just pitch my case",neutral
as best as I can.Until you snuff that torch,anger
"and my name is up there,I have to just hope",neutral
that I can just say onelast thing and offer one last...,neutral
I don't know. I-I don't know.,sadness
"It's like guns blazing,whatever I have left.",anger
I'm just throwing anythingout there.,neutral
"Jonathan, how do you feel about",neutral
that aspect of the gamein this sense?,surprise
"The better player you are,",neutral
the more likelyyou are to be taken out.,fear
"In theory, in a lot of games,the better player you are,",neutral
the more likely you are to win'cause you're better.,anger
"It's a fine line. If you aren'ta great player, then",neutral
"people wantto keep you till the end, but",neutral
"if you're looked atas too strong, then done.",anger
Or finding the person,fear
"or peoplethat you really can trust,",neutral
"and they... you work togetherto get to the end,",neutral
"even if you're a good player,that helps out.",neutral
"But again, it is Survivor.That changes quickly.",surprise
And what does that mean?,surprise
"That you can be a good player,",neutral
and if you findanother good player,neutral
"that you trust,then maybe the two of you bond",happiness
and you protect each other?,surprise
Yeah. You don't even haveto be two good players.,anger
Just two people that really know,neutral
that they haveeach other's back.,happiness
As long as one of themdoesn't feel,neutral
"the other one has an upper hand,you kind of work together.",anger
"I mean,but it's a hard thing to find.",neutral
"Well, Maryanne, the key is,you have to align with people",neutral
"that you believe you can beat,",anger
"and the trick is,they're aligning with you",surprise
because they believethey can beat you.,anger
"Exactly, and so many people havetried to play that fine line",neutral
and played it a little too well.,surprise
"That's truly why I thinkOmar is there, because he...",neutral
"I thought I was his number one,but then",sadness
"I realized that if I did takemy number one to the end,",neutral
I'd be takenand herded as a goat.,fear
"But you have to realize,""Okay, no. I have",neutral
"""to go, and I now haveto find new allies",neutral
"""who are round the same levelas me",neutral
"so I actually have a chanceto win at the end.""",surprise
"So, Romeo, if you were gonnagive this vote a title,",neutral
this chapter is called what?What's the vote about?,surprise
"I would call it ""The Fighter.""",neutral
Whoever it is didn't give up.,surprise
"So, Lindsay,you think he's talking to you?",surprise
"It's ""Lindsay: The Fighter""?",surprise
"Yeah, but I-I like that title.I'm cool with it.",happiness
If-if the reasonfor me leaving is because,sadness
"no one thinks they can beat me,",anger
that's the best wayfor me to leave.,neutral
"All right, well, it soundslike it is time to vote.",neutral
"Romeo, you're up.",surprise
"All right, if anybody hasan advantage or an idol,",neutral
"and you want to play it,now would be the time to do so.",neutral
Jeff.,neutral
"I waited 21 yearsto do this, also.",sadness
"However, I can't play itfor myself,",neutral
but I want to repaysomebody's loyalty to me.,neutral

And similar to Darwin's theoryof natural selection,neutral

who survives this apocalyptic game...,fear
that we've had in season 42.,neutral
"So, for tonight,",neutral
what we really want youto do is present,neutral
your survival of the fittest strategy,anger
"and make us sure thatyou deserve to win,",anger
because all our votesare open tonight for any of you.,neutral
"All right,let's start with social.",neutral
"Okay, so, Mike,my perception of you,",neutral

It appears that you do not wantto lie or deceive in this game.,neutral
"Maryanne, my perception of youis that you're bubbly, young,",happiness
"you're talkative,you're silly and goofy.",happiness
Sometimes you mighttake parts of the game,neutral
"less seriously than others,is how it appears.",neutral
"And, Romeo,my perception of you is,",neutral
"there are times whenyou are quiet, more reserved,",neutral
"you know, scattered with boutsof frantic paranoia",fear

- Mike.- I think it's a great question.,happiness
"Um, I think you described mepretty well.",neutral
"Um, I think I've absolutelyplayed the game",surprise
as honorableas I could play a game,neutral
"that is about deception,about backstabbing.",anger
"There was only one timeI went against my word,",sadness
"and that was to Rocksroy, andI owe him an apology for that,",anger
but I thinkI've played the game true,neutral
to how I wantedto play the game.,neutral
Maryanne.,neutral
"So, I agree with almostall of your perception with me.",neutral
The only partwhich I don't agree with,anger
was when you said that I don'treally take the game seriously.,anger
"So, me not taking the game seriously",neutral
was actuallya part of my strategy.,neutral
"When I came into the merge, Irealized that there was a trend.",surprise
"If you were young,like under 25, and you seemed",neutral
"like you were strategic,you would be voted out.",anger
Zach got voted out-- under 25.Swati got voted out-- under 25.,sadness
Lydia got voted out-- under 25.,sadness
"Tori, you were under 25.",neutral
"You showed thatyou were strategic,",neutral
and you were on the bottomfor the whole time.,anger

"and then,when there were fewer people,",neutral
I'd be ableto start to show my strategy,neutral
further and further in the game.,neutral
Romeo.,sadness
"So, the only negative wordthat you said about me",anger
"was, uh, ""paranoid.""",fear
"And, at a certain point, I was,",neutral
"because, when we gotto the merge of Kula Kula,",neutral
I quickly went fromfeeling like I was the boss,happiness
to the employee.,neutral
And I was at the bottomof every single Tribal Council.,sadness
"And the random votes,",neutral
"yes, I did do that,but that was purposely,",anger
because I didn't want to votefor the person that was going.,anger
"Chanelle, I knew you were going.I didn't vote for you.",sadness
"Tori, I'm glad thatI didn't have to vote.",happiness
"Hai, you saved me,",happiness
"and I told you I wasn't gonnavote for you when you went,",anger
and I voted for Jonathan. Um...,neutral
"But your strategy of throwinghinky votes to rile people up,",anger
"you did that to me,it succeeded,",anger
and you proceededto gaslight me.,anger
"So, was that partof your social game?",anger
"No, I did not gaslight you.",anger
"You saved me, andI didn't want to vote for you.",surprise
"I refused to vote for you.Let me, let me specify.",anger
The gaslighting waswhen I asked you,anger
if you threw the hinky voteat me at the Chanelle vote-off.,anger
"And you said, ""No, I did not.""",anger
Yes.,neutral
So you did gaslight me.,anger
"For that time, yes,",neutral
because you came at me aggressively.,anger
"But you came at me aggressively, too.",anger
I was just-- I let my feelingsget to me.,sadness
"And it-it came from Drea,",surprise
'cause I felt Dreareplaced me with you.,sadness
You were so goodthat you... that you were...,surprise
"that she replaced me,and I'm sorry.",sadness
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.- Thank you for owning that.,neutral

you touted a lot around camp,anger
"about honesty, integrity,you're a man of your word.",happiness
"- Yes.- And you said earlier, is that the only time",neutral
you've ever lied in the gamewas to Rocksroy.,anger
But did you not lie to Dreaon the beach,neutral
about going after Romeoto make her feel comfortable?,neutral
"And you said, ""Omar,we got to vote out Drea.",anger
"You know I'm just trying to make her comfortable, right?""",neutral
"Well, I never purposely",neutral
"sacrificed my integrity,but there were times",sadness
that I had to do thingsthat maybe I didn't want to do.,sadness
I had to protect myself.,fear
"That's honor for myself, also.",happiness
"Mike, I don't thinkI hear you owning up",anger
to what we're asking you. Okay.,neutral
"And so, I just want to kind of",neutral
- really dig in.- Okay.,neutral
"How many people in this gamedid you shake their hands,",neutral
"did you look in their eyes,did you give your word,",neutral
and then didyou lie to their faces?,anger
"I'm gonna be honest,",neutral
there's only one personthat I shook their hand,neutral
"and said something,and that was Rocksroy.",surprise
"Everybody else,I absolutely kept my word,",neutral
"and, until, no, no,until they deceived me first.",anger
And I'll explain what happened.,neutral
"Rocksroy says to me,I say to him,",neutral
"""Is this easy as it is?""We shook hands.",neutral
"I said, ""I'm voting Romeo.""",neutral
"At the last minute,you came up to me and said,",surprise
"""Listen, we haveto vote Rocksroy off.""",anger
"I said,""I can't vote Rocksroy off.",neutral
"I just told himI wasn't voting him off.""",surprise
"And you said, ""No, we have to.""",anger
"I said, ""If we're in an allianceand I'm your number one,",neutral
"""how come I didn't knowuntil 30 minutes prior",surprise
"to us going to a Tribal?""",surprise
"You shook my hand,and you blindsided me.",surprise
"I was never deceitful. Your words are...Yes, but then, okay.",anger
So you're telling methat you weren't deceitful?,anger
- Then-then I...- I think somebody else might have lied to you.,surprise
You don't realize that Omar waslying to you the entire time?,anger
"But then you weren't talking to me.Yes, I was, Mike.",neutral
I didn't even know you werein an alliance with them.,surprise
I told you.,anger
"It kind of comes down to,anybody who's aligned with you",neutral
is not allowedto talk to other people...,anger
- Mm.- ...when that's how people get information,neutral
"to be able to give you,yet you are allowed",neutral
to talk to lots of differentpeople and have one-on-ones.,neutral
And that's whereit seems inconsistent.,disgust
That's true.But was that the strategy?,neutral
"We're trying to understand,was that strategy,",surprise
or was that just like...?It was.,neutral
It was absolutely strategyto use,surprise
my social game for the allianceI was in and for myself,neutral
"to advance in the game.Okay, but you just claimed",neutral
that your game was to be honestand have dignity.,anger
"That is not whatit's sounding like, Mike.",anger
"- You need to own your game.- Well... I am, I'm saying it right now.",neutral
"I just want to,I just want us to settle down",neutral
because we all lied to people.,sadness

Thank you.,happiness

"was putting you in danger,",fear
and did you do anything tochange that later in the game?,neutral
"Yep. And I can understand that,",neutral
and giving me the chanceto explain my social game.,neutral
"To be completely honest,",neutral
I didn't realize thatmy social game was as sloppy,sadness
as I thought it wasuntil the fake merge.,disgust
"I truly was sitting there,",neutral
"being like, ""Wow,I'm doing such a great job.",happiness
"I'm living such a great life.""",happiness
"And, like,I'm gonna be honest about that.",neutral
"Like, I feelas if that's because",surprise
"when I got comfortable,I started to play",neutral
a little bit more emotionally.,neutral
"When I play emotionally,",neutral
I'm someone where I loveto tell everyone everything.,happiness
And you literallycan't do that on Survivor.,anger
Does that answer your question?,neutral
- Yeah.- I want to piggyback off of that.,surprise
Mm-hmm.Was there any particular people,neutral
that you wereable to draw in yourself,neutral
"for a vote,or just for an alliance?",neutral
The person who I feelI specifically went,surprise
"and drew in for a votewas Romeo at your vote, Omar,",neutral
"because Romeo and I were kind ofworking back and forth together,",neutral
and you two were very gung hoalready about voting Omar out.,anger
- So it was time to take out Omar. But the...- Hold on.,anger
- That's not... That's not how you knew.- Yeah.,surprise
- I told Mike to team up with you to take Omar out.- Yeah.,neutral
This wasn't a movethat you came up with.,anger
"Yes, you two did goand think of it first,",surprise
but I can tell you and promise,neutral
that I wasalready thinking about it.,surprise
"I was deciding whetherI'd take him out at six or five,",neutral
"and I will agree that Mike andyou talking to me is what said,",neutral
"""Okay, it needs to be at six.""",neutral
Okay.,neutral
So I want to hearthe same thing from Romeo.,neutral
"What is a big social movethat you did, Romeo?",surprise
"So, for me, I'm moreof a one-on-one conversation,",neutral
as opposed tositting around camp,neutral
and just speaking out loudin front of groups.,neutral
That's not what I do.,neutral
"Back home,I work with women one-on-one,",neutral
"and that's what I did with eachand every one of you,",neutral
"I felt like, whether I wasin alliance with you or not,",neutral
I had a relationship.,sadness
"So, to answer your question,that was my social move--",neutral
making allianceswith every single person.,neutral
- Okay. Got it.- Like I made with you.,neutral
Like I madewith Omar and Maryanne.,anger
Like I made with Drea and Rocks.,neutral
Like I madewith every single person.,anger
"All right, I'm gonna move this",neutral
into the physical partof the game.,neutral
"Rocksroy, I can't think of a Survivor in recent memory...",neutral
"- ...who's enjoyed the physical part of the game as much as you.- Yeah, buddy.",happiness
- Yeah.- So why don't you get us started in this section?,neutral
"Uh, one of the things I noticedis, uh, for a lot of players",neutral
"this year, is just basic skills.",neutral
"Doing physical work,building a shelter,",happiness
identifying plants or whatever.,neutral
What skills did you guys thinkyou brought to the game?,neutral
Maryanne?,neutral
"So, one of the things whichI did was weave palm fronds.",neutral
"So, when we were all still gungho about weaving palm fronds,",neutral
"I showed most of my tribe,""Hey, this is how we weave it.""",happiness
And I also used itfor other things.,neutral
I made Omar's prayer mat.This is just an example,neutral
to show thatI weave palm fronds.,neutral
Another thingwhich I knew how to do,neutral
"was, I was very, very goodat scaling and gutting fish.",neutral
My family were-were Luo--which is a tribe from Kenya--,neutral
and we love eating tilapia.,happiness
"So when you buy it in, like,little buckets of it,",neutral
you have to individuallyscale them and gut them.,disgust
"So I've always been growing up,watching my mom doing this.",neutral
"So, even thoughI can't catch a fish,",sadness
"I can go and be like, ""Thank youfor bringing this fish.",neutral
"I'm going to prepare it soyou don't have to do that work.""",neutral
Mike.,neutral
"Um, I thinkthe most important thing,",neutral
"in regards to strength,is my work ethic.",neutral
I didn't stop moving oncein the 26 days I was out here.,neutral
"Every single time somethingwas needed to be done,",anger
even if I didn't knowhow to do it. I cut bamboo.,neutral
I went and got wood. I built.,neutral
You are the only reasonwe had a merge shelter.,sadness
It was incredibleto watch you work,surprise
"- the first two weeks of Vati.- And I got to be honest with you,",neutral
I didn't knowwhat the hell I was doing.,anger
"It was fantastic,and you did it so fast.",happiness

So I'm gonnabe honest with everyone.,neutral
I've never been campinga day in my life.,surprise
I just learned how to swimto come out on Survivor.,surprise
I-I was just...That was very impressive,surprise
consideringyou just learned how to swim.,happiness
"I thought you did really, really well.I was, I was not...",surprise
"Number one,I'm terrified of heights.",fear
And I just learned how to swim.,happiness
"And now I have to do both,",neutral
"and on national TV,in my underwear.",surprise
"So, I'm like...",surprise
"And you hate hearing Jeff say,""Romeo dead last.""",anger
"And-- but-but that last challenge,",fear
I knew I was gonna win.I didn't care what it was.,anger
"I was like,""I'm not leaving Survivor",anger
"without my dreamof wearing that necklace.""",sadness
"And I pulled it through, and I,and I was so proud of myself.",happiness
"And I think that was the mostimportant immunity challenge,",surprise
'cause it gave me power.,neutral
"And it felt goodto have power in this game,",happiness
so it meant the world to me.,happiness
"All right,let's move into strategy.",neutral
"So, my vote, just so you know,",neutral
is off of game strategy--how you played this game.,anger
So I want to knowwhat your biggest move,neutral
"that you did on your own,in this game, was.",neutral
"Um, Romeo.",surprise
"For me, my gamequickly shifted into,",surprise
"unfortunately,a self-preservation game,",fear
'cause my namewas always at the bottom.,sadness
"I had to make as many alliancesas I could,",neutral
"and hopefullythat would push me through,",neutral
and that did.,neutral
"But somebody's just gonna say,""Okay, well,",fear
"we'll take Romeo,'cause we could beat him.""",anger
"So I figure,""Okay, I need to do something.""",neutral
And the first thing wascreate a fake immunity idol.,surprise
"Whether it worked or didn't,",neutral
"that was just to get people'sattention away from me,",anger
to not vote for me.,anger
"Then the last and finalimmunity challenge,",surprise
"I knew I had to win,",anger
to show that nobody carried meto the final three.,anger
I put myself there.,neutral
Why did you take Maryanneto three?,anger
Mm. Good question.,neutral
"I felt that she didn'thave a strategy,",anger
and my best move wasto bring somebody that was,neutral
perceivedto be playing a similar game.,neutral
And I secured my own fateby putting myself,sadness
"in the final three, and-and...and the rest is up to you guys.",neutral
"Mike, what's something thatyou solely did on your own?",surprise
"Once we got to the merge,",neutral
I decided to make my big move.,happiness
And I thoughtHai was too strong.,surprise
I was nervousthat he was coming at me.,fear
And I organizeda blindside on Hai.,surprise
And that's whenI started working,neutral
"with, uh, Lindsay and Omar",neutral
to better my game strategically.,neutral
"Do you think you playedan emotionally-charged game,",neutral
or do you thinkyou played a strategic game?,anger
I think I played both.,neutral
"I think I playeda strategic game,",neutral
"but I also think I playedan emotional game, too.",neutral
Sometimes my emotiongot the best of me.,anger
Um...,surprise
"- I'm-- I'm being told that I gave my word,",fear
"and I, and I wentagainst it a lot.",anger
maybe I didn't play as much,neutral
"with integrity as I thoughtI did, to be honest with you.",neutral
"And I, maybe I misconstruedexactly what I was doing.",sadness
"But again, you have to saysome stuff that is not true,",anger
or else you'regonna get steamrolled.,anger
You're gonna be voted out.,anger
I would havebeen out a long time ago,anger
if I didn't do what I did--I know I would have.,sadness
"So at seven on, I realized I'mplaying the game of Survivor.",surprise
"I used the beginningof the game to set up that game,",neutral
"and then, from seven down,I played the game",neutral
that I thought that wouldbest get me to the end.,surprise
"Maryanne, I'm really,really interested",surprise
"in what you have to say,'cause we slept together",anger
"by the fire every night,",happiness
and I don't know whatyou really did in the game.,anger
My one big movethat I did was set myself up,neutral
"to be in the final three,with multiple combinations",neutral
with Omar's vote.Let me explain to you why.,neutral
"When I voted out Omar,Mike gave me his word",neutral
"that he will give mehis idol at the final five,",neutral
and that wouldguarantee me the final four.,surprise
"But then, you know,you might be like,",neutral
"""Mike backed on his word.So, like, how were you so sure?""",anger
"And the reason is, I keptthe only secret in this game.",surprise
"I, actually, after your vote,Tori, had the merge idol.",surprise
I can show it to you right now.,surprise
And I told no one about it.,sadness
You can see it over here.,neutral
Here's the idol.Here's the note.,neutral
So now we're thenoff to my final four,neutral
"of Jonathan, Mike, me and Romeo.",neutral
"So that meant that if I won,",neutral
"I'm going to the end,because I'm not making fire.",sadness
"If Mike won, he gave me his wordthat I would go to the end.",neutral
"If Romeo won,",surprise
"Romeo was afraid of Mike,he would take me to the end.",fear
"And if Jonathan won,he would want to go",neutral
"and have that final big moveto take Mike out,",anger
and Romeo and Iwould be at the end.,neutral
"By taking you out, Omar,",neutral
I gave myself the best positionto be sitting here.,happiness
Touché.,surprise
I have a question.,neutral
What's your story,neutral
of your personal evolutionplaying this game?,surprise
"Like, what did you learnabout yourself?",neutral
"Romeo, I'd like you to start.",neutral
"Um, I felt like,",neutral
"for at leastthe second part of this game,",neutral
I was holding onby the skin of my teeth.,fear
"And back home I would say,",neutral
"""Screw it. Let me justtry something else.""",anger
"But out here,I couldn't do that",neutral
because I was not justrepresenting me.,neutral
That was not the gameI wanted to play.,anger
"I didn't want to playfrom the bottom,",neutral
but that was the gamethat was dealt to me.,sadness
And I-I-I... and I sawan opening and a window,surprise
for these two peoplethat were going to play with me.,neutral
"And then, the next vote,",neutral
these three people wantto play with me.,happiness
"And then this person was gone,so then",sadness
"I had to find another person,and I just kept going",sadness
"until I won that final immunity,",surprise
"and that's what I'm goingto take away from this game,",neutral
"is, no matterhow hard this game was--",neutral
and I can tell thisto the girls,neutral
"that I work with,empowering back home--",neutral
I didn't give up.,happiness
I didn't give up.I'm leaving this game,sadness
as a free manwho will no longer have to hide,happiness
because I'm scaredof what people might think--,fear
even my religious familyback home--,sadness
"just because I'm gay,and they won't accept me.",sadness
I'm going to... I'm goingto leave this game as a free man,happiness
to live my life the way I wantedto live since I was 19.,neutral
And it took mein my 30s to figure it out.,surprise
And just a quick shout-outto you,happiness
for making me comfortableto do that.,happiness
Thank you.Thank you. Mike?,neutral
"So, for me, I thinkthat I proved that",neutral
"people that are older,like myself",neutral
"and Rocksroy, can come out here,",neutral
"compete in the game,play the game hard,",anger
"and get alongwith the younger generation,",happiness
which sometimes is not so easy.,neutral
"For myself, I-I learned that",neutral
I can still do what I thoughtI couldn't do anymore.,surprise
"You know, I-I-I talked a lotabout my kids, and it just...",sadness
For my kidsto see me come out here,neutral
and do what I didand... and-and compete,anger
"and-and... and succeedto a certain level,",happiness
that they would seethat they can do anything,happiness
"that they've put their mindto it,",neutral
and that there was no...,neutral
There's no boundariesas to what they can accomplish,surprise
in their life.,neutral
So that's what I learnedabout myself.,neutral
"Maryanne?So,",neutral
"the thing which I really learnedabout myself is that,",neutral
"a lot of times we talk abouthow Survivor breaks you down,",sadness
how it takes your insecurities.,fear
"And I realized, I,with the Omar vote,",neutral
made my path to the end.,neutral
But there was a chance thatI was going to lose the game,fear
and not know why.,sadness
So then I startedto self-sabotage myself.,sadness
"I really wantedto bring Lindsay to the end,",sadness
"but in my mind, I'm like,""I cannot beat Lindsay.""",fear
'Cause that meansthat I wanted to go,neutral
and give myself an easy out,anger
because I didn't want,neutral
to feel that rejectionof friendship.,sadness
"Even recently in my life,a couple years ago,",neutral
"someone spread a rumor about me,and I lost so many friends,",sadness
and I didn't wantto feel that again.,sadness
I kind of knewthat that's how I self-sabotage.,sadness
"Like, when I was young,I used to push people away",sadness
so they couldn't goand hurt me first.,fear
"And it's like,to know that I'd do it",neutral
"in something that I love, too,it's like, it shows",happiness
"that I still needto grow as a person,",sadness
"and I'm still growing,which is why, like,",neutral
I'm still proud of myself.,happiness
"Because I really,really was so, so close",disgust
"to playing my idol for you,",happiness
"like, before we went to Tribal.But I'm like, ""Maryanne,",neutral
"you need to grow and you needto make yourself open."" Like,",neutral
I knew that I still hadto take that chance to lose,sadness
because I deservethat chance to win.,anger

"You held them accountable, but",anger
you were always respectfuland at times,neutral
even encouragingand inspiring them,happiness
to try to give a better answer.,neutral
"And, Romeo, Maryanne and Mike,you did a great job.",happiness
It's very hard to sit over there,sadness
"and take that from them,",anger
- but that is what you want.- Very hard.,neutral
"You want the opportunityfor them to grill you,",anger
and I think all three of youheld yourself in really,neutral

The hard part of thisdecision of playing it safe,fear
versus risking your vote is that,neutral
I don't know whatChanelle's gonna do.,fear
I could either play itsafe or take a risk,fear
and wager my voteto have an extra vote.,anger
"Initially, my thought is,just play it safe,",fear
"but as I thought itthrough, in this game,",neutral
it's all about motivation.,happiness
You have to knowother players' motivation,anger
and what's best for their game.,neutral
I don't think Chanelle'sgoing to risk her vote.,fear
"From my read on Omar,I think that he might",neutral
"play it safe, and I thinkthat he wants to protect me",happiness

Chanelle made itvery clear to me,neutral
that she could notlose her vote tonight.,fear

with risking my vote.Which means,anger

"I took a gamble,and I risked my vote.",anger
"And so, might not evenhave a vote tonight.",neutral
"My first thought is,Mike can't vote, and",neutral

Chanelle might not have a vote.,neutral
So the plan going in was for Haiand Lydia to split votes,neutral
"where Hai wouldput a vote on Mike,",anger
Lydia would put a vote on Jenny.,neutral
And then I would vote for Lydia,neutral
so that my Lydia vote combinedwith Jenny's Lydia vote,neutral
would be the majority.,neutral
So it'd be a two-one-one vote.,neutral
Lydia.,neutral
"Yeah, solid.",neutral
"The problem is, this playat Tribal really only works",neutral
if Hai and Lydia are bothgenuinely tricked into splitting.,surprise
What's going on? What'd I miss?,surprise

she seemed a bit frazzled.,fear
"All of a sudden, she wantsto vote: girls Jenny and boys Mike.",surprise
"Girls on Jenny, boys on Mike.",neutral

"Daniel, do you agree, tonightwill draw lines no matter what?",anger
100% it's gonna draw lines.,neutral
"That's true, but, Jeff, let metell you why I will lose season 42.",sadness
The reason is because I'mconstantly in a state of paranoia.,fear
"I'm running numbers, going nuts.It's driving me crazy.",anger
And you can't win that way,anger
because you've gotto trust your gut.,neutral
"But if you're always paranoid,you can't trust your gut",fear
because you can't differentiate,neutral
between the paranoiaand your gut.,fear

I think Chanelle needs to gobecause I agree with Hai.,anger
She's likely toflip at the merge.,anger
"So if you knowsomeone's going to flip,",anger
it's better to get ridof 'em when you can,anger

Both Daniel and Chanellehave felt as though,neutral
they've reintegrated themselvesback into the tribe.,neutral
It's just...,sadness

I feel a lot better.,happiness
I'll do whatever you want.,neutral
"Now that Mike has his vote,",neutral
we have the majorityof the votes,happiness
"between Lydia, myself and Mike",neutral
that we can split upjust in case,fear
one of them plays a Shotin the Dark or has an advantage.,surprise
"The main thing is, Lydia cannothave taken that shot.",surprise
We need her vote.,neutral
"At this journey, it's extremelyimportant what Lydia does.",surprise
"The main thingthat Lydia can't do,",neutral
can't do is take a chancefor an advantage.,anger

Holy cow.,surprise
Wow.,surprise

I'm learning a lot about myself.,happiness
One of those things is justbeing comfortable in my own skin.,happiness
"I've struggled,as most young women",sadness
"and just, like,young people in general,",neutral
struggle with body image issues.,sadness
"And coming on Survivor wasa really big challenge for me,",fear
"not only just withthe elements but just, like,",neutral
you see people veryopen with their bodies.,surprise
And a big source of the wayI started dressing was,neutral
just 'cause I wastrying to hide.,fear
But you can onlybe open out here.,neutral
And my body is perfectjust the way it is.,happiness
And I feel like I have gottenmore confident in it.,happiness
"It's not even halfway throughthe game, and I'm just, like,",surprise
I've already accomplished so much.,happiness
There's still more to see.,surprise
"There's still more to do,and it's just going",neutral
to keep getting moreand more beautiful.,happiness
So who do you thinktonight's going to be...,surprise
- ...on the chopping block for you guys?- For us?,surprise
I don't know.,neutral
"I know, and, of course,like, I'm not there.",neutral
"So I'm just nervous, of course,",fear
"going in, you know,that it could be me.",fear
Even though I amin a decent position,neutral
"going into Tribal now,I'd mentioned I was, like,",neutral
kind of on the bottom.,sadness
"I'm just meeting Rocksroy,",neutral
so I'm trying not to give toomuch information about our tribe.,fear
So you feel asif you're gonna...,fear
you could be a potential?,surprise
"Definitely, yeah, I was definitelyon the chopping block last time.",fear
"- Why?- Um, no idea.",surprise
"My first impression of Lydiawas, she seemed more like",neutral
"someone that's in trouble,but, of course,",fear
"as I didn't, you don't wantto give your opponent",anger
too much information.,neutral
Are you guys all tight?,neutral
"Uh, who is tight?",surprise
"- You know, it's like...- Yeah.",neutral
I'm trying to justget a feel for,neutral
"how camp life is,who he trusts, and",neutral
I got nothing.,sadness
"""You will now separateand make a private decision",neutral
"before returning to camp.""",neutral
"Hey, I'm rooting for you.",happiness
"- Thank you, I appreciate it.- All right? I am.",happiness
Rocksroy was being very cagey.,surprise
And I feel like I was as well.,neutral
I think we both wantedto protect our tribe.,neutral
Because we don't know wherewe're headed to in this game.,fear
"""Protect your vote.""",neutral
"""Risk your vote.""",anger
"""Here's how it works.""",neutral
"If Lydia and I both pick""risk your vote,""",neutral
then we both lose our voteat the next Tribal Council.,fear
"If Lydia and I say ""protect ourvote,"" then nothing changes",neutral
and we're able to voteat the next Tribal Council.,neutral
"But if Lydia says""protect her vote""",neutral
"and I choose ""risk your vote,""then Lydia remains the same;",neutral
"me, I receive an extra vote.",happiness
I feel like as ifI should risk my vote.,fear
"But speaking with Lydia,seems as if",neutral
she's on the bottom ofthe totem pole in her tribe.,sadness
I think she's gonna risk itfor the biscuit.,happiness
An opportunity like thisdefinitely doesn't come...,surprise
very often.,neutral
Having an advantage in thisgame is just so important.,surprise
"Coming from Vegas,don't gamble often,",neutral
"but when I do, I know that whenI'm up on the house, walk away.",neutral
So I'm gonna use my brain...,neutral
...and I'm gonnaprotect my vote.,anger
"It is so hard to getadvantages in the game,",sadness
but I think it scares memore to not have a vote,fear
going into a reallyimportant Tribal.,fear
Lydia!,surprise
- Welcome back.- Welcome home party.,happiness
I'm very glad thatI protected my vote.,happiness
"If circumstances weredifferent, I definitely think",surprise
I might have risked itfor my own personal gain.,disgust
"The same thing as Jenny said,you go to a wheel,",neutral
"risk your vote,protect your vote.",anger
- I protected my vote.- Nice.,happiness
But we're not in individual yet.,neutral
"We're going to Tribaltonight as a tribe,",happiness
and I just don't feelcomfortable giving away,neutral
the most important thingI have in this game.,neutral
"I'm gonna go down to the beach,and wash my feet off,",happiness
if anybody wantsto come with me.,surprise
But now I really want totouch base with everyone,neutral
to give me a rundownof what happened at camp.,neutral
How are you feelingabout tonight?,neutral
I'm okay.,neutral
"Yeah, Mike is like, ""I'm writingDaniel's name down.""",surprise
You know he's got his vote back now?,surprise
"Yes, I guess.",neutral
I feel good.,happiness
"Like, I was like...",surprise
If anything...,surprise
I trust you and Hai.,happiness
"Yeah, no, you absolutelycan trust us.",surprise
I'm sorry that I voted for you.,sadness
- It was a mistake.- Yeah.,sadness
I'm totally with yougoing forward.,neutral
"To be totally honest, I thinkyou are the queenmaker.",surprise
You and Hai...,neutral
"...are deciding,",neutral
and I think Chanelle and Iare probably on the block.,fear
"Daniel and Chanelle,definitely,they're very nervous,",fear
but they both think it'sthe other person going home.,surprise
"Chanelle, I don't fully trust her,",fear
and Daniel is a liability.,anger
"And at our last Tribal Council,he was trying to get me out.",anger
"But clearly, me and Hai",neutral
are definitely running this vote.,anger
So here's the recap.I've talked to everyone.,neutral
Mike is 100 on board.,surprise
- Daniel is voting Chanelle.- For sure.,neutral
"Lydia gets back,and I have to scramble",fear
"to get some alone time with her,",neutral
because we are aboutto head to Tribal immediately.,fear
I know 100% thatDaniel is comfortable.,neutral
"It's not you.It's between Daniel, Chanelle.",neutral
So that's where it stands.,neutral
- As long as it's not me.- It's not you.,neutral
"It's not us, we just haveto stick to the plan.",neutral
"The merge is coming upany day now,",fear
so tonight's TribalCouncil is monumental,surprise
"because not only does itaffect the rest of my game,",anger
it's going to affect howthe merge is going to play out.,fear
I'm just nervous because,fear
whether it be Chanelle or Daniel,neutral
that goes intothe merge with me,neutral
will determine howwell I do in this game.,neutral
All right.,neutral
"Mike, give me an analogy",neutral
from your worldthat you come from,neutral
that captures wherethis tribe is at.,neutral
"You know, Jeff, once in a while,when I was a fireman,",neutral
somebody on the crewmaybe didn't do something,anger
"that they should have did,",anger
but that didn't meanwe didn't stick together.,happiness
"As with this tribe, tonight",neutral
"we're gonna losea member of our tribe,",sadness
but it doesn't meanthat we're not solid.,neutral
"Daniel, what do youread into that?",surprise
Mike is a straight shooter.,neutral
"Mike, to his core,is a team guy.",happiness
"Some people comeinto this game,",neutral
"and from the get-go, they'replaying an individual game.",anger
And I don't think you canwin Survivor doing that.,anger
And Mike is notone of those people.,neutral
"So then, Hai, how do youvote somebody out",neutral
if Mike's story is accurate?,surprise
"Which is, we're justone firehouse,",neutral
but somebody's got to go.,sadness
"Yeah, this game is hard.",neutral
I see five autonomousplayers here,neutral
who all have the goalof getting to the end.,neutral
"So unfortunately someonehere is being lied to,",sadness
or multiple people.,neutral
"Daniel, let's go with Hai's idea",neutral
that somebody's being lied to.,anger
Give me an analogyfrom your world...,surprise
"- Oh, geez.- ...where lying is fun.",surprise
It's part of it.,neutral
"I should be honest with you, Jeff,",neutral
I'm not an analogy guy.,neutral
"But, sorry, can I jump backon the Mike thing?",surprise
"- Yeah.- When he talks about teams,",neutral
he's not talking aboutteams just in Survivor.,neutral
"I think Mike sees this as a teamfor, like, the rest of his life.",surprise
And by that I meanthe very end.,neutral
That's true.,neutral
"Wait, when you said""to the very end,""",surprise
"- ...you mean until you are dying.- Yeah, I think, I think,",neutral
"I think, like, hopefullyI live longer than Mike.",fear
- Um...- It's a very good possibility.,surprise
Yeah.,neutral
"Yeah, but, like, I feel likeMike and I will probably,",neutral
"you know, be friends to thevery end of whoever goes first.",happiness
Knock on wood it's not me.,fear
"Mike's 117, so we don't knowhow much longer he has.",sadness
- 116.- Yeah.,neutral
- 116.- Yeah.,neutral
"Jeff, I actually want tojump in because I think that,",neutral
"like, the two different themesthat you're noting.",neutral
Friendship and thenthe game of Survivor,surprise
"I think we're seeing itcome to play, like,",neutral
right here in front of us.,neutral
"Because Daniel's comment rightthere is him playing the game,",neutral
"playing to Mike'ssoft spot, his heart.",happiness
Let me just go and patMike on the back again.,happiness
"Team, friendship.",happiness
"And so, like, that's playingthe game right there.",neutral
It's almost kind ofmilking it a bit.,disgust
"Daniel, that was pretty clear.",surprise
She doesn't buy it.,neutral
"You might mean it,but right now",sadness
you're saying itbecause you're at Tribal.,anger
"I didn't mean any game strategyby that, to be totally honest.",neutral
I try to be asgenuine as possible.,neutral
"Like, there are thingsthat I could have kept secret.",fear
"I mean, I'm a leukemia survivor.",sadness
"I could have kept that secret,",sadness
but I cannot play this gamewithout being true to who I am.,neutral
"And, yes, you have tolie sometimes and stuff,",anger
"but I analogize that to, like...",neutral
"I have an analogy, actually.Yes.",surprise
"Okay, I analogize thatto boxing.",surprise
"You know, like, Muhammad Ali",neutral
was one of the best boxersin the entire world.,neutral
He didn't go down the streetpunching random people.,neutral
He only punched peoplewhen he was boxing.,anger
"Right?, so when we'replaying Survivor, we lie,",anger
"but in our real lives,we don't lie.",neutral
"It's just, like,part of the game.",neutral
"So, Lydia, then whatwould a vote",neutral
be based on tonightwith this tribe?,surprise
What are some of the criteriathat might come up?,neutral
"You know, after tonight,",surprise
"each tribe is gonna befour, four and four.",neutral
"And so no onehas numbers, you know?",surprise
"And we're speculating a merge,you know, coming up.",neutral
Hopefully soon.,neutral
- Please.- We've been talking about that feast.,neutral
"Even if it was rice, we're like:""All right, we'll take it.""",happiness
"So I think one ofthe criteria is, like,",neutral
who can I trust the mostgoing forward?,neutral
Especially in a game wherethe numbers are not obvious.,surprise
"All right, so, Hai, for Lydia,she's saying it's trust.",neutral
- Yeah.- How about for you?,neutral
"100%, trust is the mostvaluable currency out here.",neutral
If you look back atthe last Tribal we were at...,sadness
...there were six blindsides.,surprise
"And when trust is broken,it's very hard to win back.",sadness
"So for me, it's aboutestablishing trust,",neutral
'cause I want tomake it to the end.,neutral
"- Daniel, you're nodding.- I mean, unless you're...",surprise
"one of the greatestplayers ever, and I'm not one,",neutral
you get burned at least once.,sadness
"You have to be ableto look past the burn,",neutral
"and sometimes, when you werethe one who did the burning,",sadness
ask for forgiveness.,sadness
"If you can't do that,",anger
I think you're gonna playa short Survivor game.,surprise
"Chanelle, if you'rekeeping the people",neutral
"that are most trustworthy,then the person",neutral
you're getting rid of hasto be the least trustworthy.,anger
"Uh, I think that's whatsomeone reasonable would deduct",neutral
"from what we'rehearing, so, yes.",surprise
"Wow, is it hard for youto answer that question?",surprise
"No, I mean, thewriting's on the wall.",neutral
"Like, a reasonableconclusion would be that",neutral
"if we are voting based on trust,the person who is voted out",anger
"is ultimately nothigh in that category,",surprise
the least trustworthy.,disgust
"And, Mike, you do haveto make those decisions.",neutral
"It doesn't mean,to your point earlier,",neutral
"that you might not likethis person personally,",anger
but in this game it'sjust not my best move.,sadness
My vote tonightis strictly gameplay.,neutral
Has nothing to do withhow I personally feel at all.,neutral
I want to be friendswith whoever gets voted off,neutral
here tonight forthe rest of my life.,sadness
Sometimes it's hardto play Survivor,sadness
in the way you want to play it.,neutral
Tonight I'm playing Survivor.,happiness
"Okay, it is time to vote.Mike, you're up.",neutral
If anybody has anadvantage or an idol,neutral
"and you want to play it, nowwould be the time to do so.",neutral
"Okay, I'll read the votes.",neutral

I want Jonathan gone.,anger
"Here's the thing. If it's nothim, it's gonna be you.",anger

I know that physicalityis the merge boot. Yeah.,surprise
Mm-hmm.,neutral
"I really don't want to vote for Jonathan,",disgust
"but the thing is, options are limited.",sadness
"It's, like, my buttis on the line, too,",fear
and I'm talkingand I'm strategizing,neutral
"and I'm scrambling, 'cause,like, there's only five people",fear
"not safe for this Tribal-- Jonathan,",fear
"Hai, me, Lindsay and Lydia.",neutral
"Jonathan is going to bea very physical threat,",fear

"Like, she's going crazy in her head,",anger
"so many different things, and she's super strategic.",surprise
- Jonathan's not as strategic.- Yeah.- For sure.,neutral
Do you think she has anythingother than the Shot in the Dark?,surprise
Yeah?,neutral
My biggest pitch is Maryanne-- that she has,neutral
a lot of hidden ammo.,fear
And I don't want to pitch Hai,neutral
because I want to work with Hai.,neutral
"Secondly, Hai told me that him",neutral
and Lydia were gonna go for rocks for each other.,neutral
So the only option left,neutral
is Maryanne.,neutral
- Good chat.- We can talk later. Yeah.- Yeah.,happiness
I need people to be more fearful,fear
of the power that she has versus,neutral
"a potential threat of meor Jonathan,",fear
'cause that's what it seemslike it's coming down to.,sadness
- No.- No. Did it for you?,anger
I see right through it.,anger
Lindsay's put her pitch outto protect herself and Jonathan.,neutral
"He catches food,and people are mesmerized",surprise
"by the ""golden boy""kind of thing.",surprise
He's not golden to me.,anger
"Like, he could go on streak,and that's always scary.",fear

"You guys can do what you want,'cause, like, I have no...",sadness
"- I'm safe, and I have no vote.- No, it's fine.",neutral
"- So, ultimately, it's your game.- Mm-hmm.",neutral
"My first instinct,",surprise
"knowing that I'm safeand I don't have a vote,",neutral
is to just shut the heck upand not say anything.,anger
Because why?Why would I jeopardize,fear
my position in the game?,neutral
"But the more I thought about it, I'm like, ""This is terrible.""",anger
"Omar, this is the timethat I need your help.",sadness
I know. That's whyI'm hustling for you.,happiness

I'm obviously the biggest threat out here,anger
"when it comes to physical,",neutral
"and if I were them, I would vote me out.",anger
But I'm gonna keep,neutral
fighting in this game'till I'm dead.,anger
"I'm voting for Maryanne,and, uh,",happiness
"stick with me.I promise, I'm loyal.",happiness
"Well, if someone has to go, then it's gonna be Maryanne.",sadness
"Here's the problem, though. The fact",neutral
that I haveto put my trust in people,fear
that I met a day and a half ago is very scary.,fear
"But we're supposed to bean alliance of eight, and, uh,",neutral
I am confident in Omar,neutral
keeping people off my back.,anger
Yes. Yes.,neutral
Um...,surprise
"But I did speak to Lindsay,and she was saying, like,",neutral
"- Maryanne is, like, a huge liability.- Oh.",disgust
"So, it's, like, it's reallywhat does your gut say--",surprise
Jonathan versus Maryanne?,neutral
It feels like you're swayedJonathan over Maryanne.,anger
I just want to do majority.,neutral
"There is eight of us that want to all work together, but",neutral
"there is just this point where I'm, like, ""I just",neutral
"want to go with the numbers.""",neutral
I don't want to be the oneon the bottom.,fear
And I kind of feel like,fear
"we could be good.We could be good,",happiness

Okay.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Lydia says to me,",neutral
"""Like, I'm really torn.""",sadness
"And I'm like,""This is opportunity.""",surprise
"Like, you're telling me",surprise
"And that's my opening to say,",neutral
"""Sacrifice little Lydia.""",anger
"Thing is, now I feelit's between Lydia and Maryanne.",neutral
- Positive?- And then I think it's going to be something.,neutral
While it will be Jonathanand not you.,surprise
"I feel like you and Lindsay werereally on the Maryanne train,",anger
"- which I-I see, long-term.- Mm-hmm.",neutral
"But right now, it's too early,and she's useful to us.",neutral
"I'm trying to bring Taku back together because,",sadness
"at this point, Maryanne has an extra vote",neutral
"and a hidden immunity idol, and I don't want either one",surprise
of those things going out of the game,sadness
"because I'm gonna need weapons,I'm gonna need arsenal,",anger
and I'm gonna need an army.,anger
"You were the primary at first,",neutral
but I'm tryingto shift it to Lydia.,neutral
- Why was I the primary?- I don't know.,surprise
"There's rumorsthat you have an idol,",surprise
so I thinkother tribes know about it.,surprise
"- Okay, just be chill, okay? I need you to be chill.- Okay. Yup.",neutral
- Because if you blow it...- It's gone.,sadness
I'm shifting things to Lydia.,neutral
"Okay,so I write down Lydia's name?",neutral
"At Tribal, you needto write down ""Lydia.""",neutral
And if I'm not successful...,fear
That's fine.,neutral
My jaw just dropped.,surprise
"I was like, ""Why me?""",surprise
"Like, I don't want to go out before the merge.",fear
"I've worked so hard to be here, and",happiness
I'm so terrified. All I wantto do is cry and scream.,fear
"But, like,I know that in this game,",neutral
"I have to go, and I have",neutral
"to center myself, and I have to stay calm.",neutral
I feel as if me playing my idol,neutral
right now--it all comes down to Omar.,neutral
The plan is obvious.We need to switch to Lydia.,neutral
"- Oh, wow.- Yeah.",surprise
Yeah?,neutral
"In this game,",neutral
"you take a little bit of information, and that's",neutral
where you weave in your own lies,anger
or your own truths to prime them of the fact,anger
"that Lydia's maybe not on their side, long-term.",fear
But Lydia right now is Hai's number-one ally in the game.,neutral
This is one of,neutral
the toughest jobs I've hadout here since I've started.,anger
I didn't wantto upset the eight,sadness
- before it got to the point.- Right. Right.,neutral
- So I didn't think it was my place to say it yet.- Right.,neutral
"But Lydia is like,""At some point",neutral
"within the eight, we needto go after the bigger players.""",anger
"I think Jonathan--it's too early for him, but now,",neutral
"it's, like,Maryanne's the only one,",neutral
- and she has an immunity idol.- Yup.,surprise
"If she plays that,it's one of the eight.",surprise
"So, Lydia is the choice here.",neutral
But I want to make sureall three of us are,neutral
"on board for the plan. Hai,",neutral
"if that's what you think,I'm with you.",neutral
Not an option at all.,disgust
"Lydia and I have been day ones out here, and I gave her",happiness
So now I have to,neutral
scramble and get herthe numbers to stay.,anger
"Okay, and now I need to getenough votes for Maryanne.",neutral
It's Jonathan and Maryanne.,neutral
Tonight's tricky. There seems to be,fear
a group who wants to target,anger
"the more physical players,",neutral
"such as Jonathan. which I don't like,",disgust
'cause I consider myself,neutral
one of the more physicalpeople here.,neutral
"I want to win moreindividual immunities, okay?",anger
And I feel likeyou would stand in my way.,anger
Which is why I need Maryanne to go home tonight.,sadness
"However, the issue is,",neutral
we know for a factthat Maryanne has an idol.,neutral
"Exactly, so we might be...we might just slip by.",fear
"In Survivor,",neutral
"your relationshipstake precedent,",neutral
and Lydia going home will only hurt my game.,sadness
This game is wild. Moments like these,surprise
are where good players,neutral
"fold, and great players",happiness
prevail.,neutral
Wow. Everybody here.,surprise
"- First time.- It's a good-looking bunch, huh?",happiness

"Everyone said,",neutral
"""Let's go get firewood,""but that firewood is empty.",sadness
I noticed that.,neutral
"So Romeo, what do you base",neutral
trust on at this point,neutral
when you don't knowa lot of these people?,surprise
"I don't know about them, but forme, it's always a gut feeling.",neutral
How are they interactingwith me?,surprise
Do they wantto start a conversation?,neutral
Or are they just startinga nonsense conversation,neutral
just to saythat they talked to me?,surprise
I can look at somebodyin the eye,neutral
and know if they're telling methe truth or not.,fear
Simple. That's just a giftI've had since I was a child.,happiness
"Drea, it's interesting.",surprise
Romeo gavea very specific situation,neutral
of somebody coming up and juststarting a BS conversation.,anger
- Right.- Do you feel like you can pick up those cues?,neutral
"I'm very good at that,but maybe",neutral
someone didn't cometo talk to you,sadness
because they didn't feelcomfortable coming to talk,sadness
to you or something like that.,neutral
"So, I see both sides.",neutral
"Hai, that's a verysophisticated approach.",surprise
You cannot just wait.,anger
"Sometimes you have to stickyour hand out and say,",neutral
"""Want to talk?""",neutral
"Yeah, it's the idea of,are you a driver",neutral
or are you a passenger?,surprise
"You know, for me, growing up,",neutral
"I didn't have a lotof confidence,",sadness
"and I knew coming out here,I didn't want to be",fear
that version of myself.,neutral
I wanted to come out hereand play with confidence,happiness

you're not gonna get anywhere.,anger
"Lydia, I really connected",happiness

"When I was in high school,we moved from Wichita, Kansas",sadness
"to Seattle, Washington,",neutral

out here in termsof what parts,neutral
of me am I gonna put outand what parts am I gonna hide?,fear
"Yeah. Growing up,",neutral
"I-I faked a lot of confidence,you know.",sadness
"And leaving my hometownand just, like,",neutral
gaining independence and justaccepting parts of myself,happiness
that I never even realized.,surprise
"You know, it... the confidenceactually became real.",happiness
"And in Survivor specifically,",neutral
you're goingto just play better,happiness
and you're gonna feel better,happiness
if you are justyour full authentic self.,happiness
"Jonathan, one of the things",neutral
you have to do in this game ishide your paranoia or your fear.,fear
"You know, the ""never let 'emsee you sweat"" thing.",anger
Does paranoia get to you?,fear
There's a point in the game,neutral
where you've doneall that you can do.,sadness
"And whoevergets kicked out of here,",anger
"I hope that they go,""I did everything I could do.",neutral
"I left it here.""",neutral
"Omar, that would be",neutral
the best way to approachevery Tribal Council.,neutral
- Yeah.- Can you do that?,neutral

Wow.,surprise
Let me justtake that statement in,neutral

"I'm worried,and not dwell on it.",fear
"Rocksroy,",neutral
- you came into this late.- Yes.,neutral
Could you sense a directionof why the vote,neutral
might be going the wayit's gonna go?,surprise
"Yeah, it's a tough one because",neutral
I'm coming in thistwo days of not being here.,neutral
But one of the things I knowthat I can rely on is,neutral
the bond that I've builtwith my alliance.,happiness

So we probably have about,neutral
three to four hours. Yeah?Yup.,neutral

There's nothing reallythat I can do.,sadness
"Think it's kind ofa no-brainer, but...",surprise

"You ask anybody that's beenwith me since the beginning,",neutral
"- what I say, I mean.- I'm not voting for you tonight, so...",anger
And I'm notvoting for you tonight.,anger
"I think, personally,",neutral
"when it comes to guys,",neutral
"guys are more rigid in making a decision,",anger
so I'm banking on that.,neutral
"Going into tonight,",neutral
"Romeo was a dead man walking,",sadness
"but in the long term,",neutral
"he's loyal to me right now,whereas Rocksroy--",neutral
I feel like there's less room to maneuver with him.,anger
"He's immovable, he's unshakable.",neutral
I'm trying to eliminate peopleat this stage of the game that,anger
I can't shape or mold to what I want.,sadness
"And so, they are comingfor you tonight.",fear
"I need to talk to Haito confirm the plan,",neutral
but I thinkwe should go for Rocks.,neutral
Hai will be the swing vote tonight.,surprise
"Yeah, but the problem is,I don't trust him.",fear
He wants me out.,sadness
"I know you're feeling that way,but you have to trust me.",sadness
So just beas calm as possible.,neutral
"The irony is,",surprise

my Survivor life depends onat tonight's Tribal Council.,fear
It's terrifying.,fear
I'm going to have to trust theone person that I don't trust.,fear
I know.,neutral
Let's just say I'm not too confident because,sadness
Hai is the sneakiest...,anger
weasel that Survivor 42 has.,surprise
I feel like you might beon the same page,neutral
with me about Rocks. Yes.,neutral
- He's getting exceedingly difficult to work with.- Yes.,anger
"If we wanted to blindside Rocks,",anger
- I would be with you a thousand percent.- Tonight?,surprise
- Here's the concern.- Yeah.,neutral
"Mike still considers me his number one.- Right, right.",happiness
"If we vote Rocks tonight,",anger
"and I don't tell Mike,",fear
- I lose his trust forever.- Right.,sadness
Tonight's vote could be very simple.,neutral
"If I wantedto make an emotional move,",neutral
I would take out Romeo.,anger
"But for me,",neutral
tonight's vote is not emotional.,neutral
It's strategic. But I don't want,neutral
to make this movewithout Mike's blessing,anger
because I don't wantto lose Mike's trust.,fear
Can I be candid with you?,neutral
Yeah. Course you could.,neutral
Here's my thought.,neutral
Obviously Romeo's very untrustworthy.,anger
"I know he's coming after me, but I'm not scared of Romeo.",fear
"Rocksroy, down the line, is gonna be hard to navigate,",fear
especially as the numbers dwindle.,sadness
We can't take him out tonight.,sadness
"- You don't want to?- No, I'm not saying... No.",surprise
"I do want to, but we can't,because if we take him out,",fear
"it'll show that we'renot trustworthy,",fear
that we would turnon our alliance.,fear
Voting Rocksroy,neutral
tarnishes what I say out here.,anger
I'm a man of my word.,neutral
What happens if we do vote Rocksroy out tonight?,fear
"Does the rest of our alliance look at us and say,",anger
"""You're not trustworthy. We could be next""?",fear
"That's what I think about,and my word is big here.",neutral
"Listen, they're gonna say,""If they turned against Rocksroy",anger
"when they promised him,they'll turn on me.""",fear
"Here's the truth,",neutral
"Rocksroy's nota hard vote for me,",anger
but I gave him my word already.,sadness
So Hai is putting me in a bad position.,anger
Hai is my number one here.,happiness
Me and Hai have been togethersince day three.,happiness
So we got to figure out what we're gonna do.,neutral
Look at all the food.,happiness
Holy cow.,surprise
"Mmm. That's so good.Oh, my gosh.",happiness
"- Oh, my God.- And tomato.",surprise
I was so close to beating Jonathan,disgust
at that immunity challenge.,surprise
"But at leastwe won a bunch of food,",happiness
which was super exciting.,happiness
"And I'm happy with the way we got divvied up,",happiness
because it's me and two other Takus.,neutral
So we're in control of who's going home tonight.,anger
"Drea has a hidden immunity idol,",surprise
so it kind of seems like Tori might be the easy target here.,sadness
I know.,neutral
"Like, I, like, I think Romeo.",neutral
"I mean, after that whole scuffle.- Yeah.",neutral
"When we got split into two different groups,",sadness
I realized this could be really good for me.,happiness
"From the beginning,",neutral
"I've had to put any egothat I've had behind me,",neutral
"because the big guy cannot come in guns a-blazing,",anger
"""This is how it's gonna be.""",anger
Because it puts an evenbigger target on your back.,fear
And now is that time.,neutral
"-So, listen. Yeah.",neutral
We're gonnaget rid of this idol.,anger
Okay? Not yours.,anger
- Drea's. I was thinking that.- Right.,neutral
"- So, listen... So, keep...- Okay. Yeah.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
And we're gonna tell Dreait's you.,surprise
"If this works,then we're golden.",happiness
This is how we have to do it.,neutral
"Jonathan is like, ""Look, we need to get Drea.",neutral
"Drea has an idol.She needs to go.""",neutral
"And I'm like,""Okay, cool. I'm on board.""",happiness
'Cause I've been on the outs since the merge.,sadness
"But then he says, ""We're gonna have Drea vote for you.""",surprise
"And I'm like, ""What the heck?""",surprise
"- -- We can flush the idol. But, like...  Okay.",surprise
We need to do it now.Do you understand?,anger
That is the plan.,neutral
Drea is going.,neutral
- Yeah. Yeah.- Okay?,neutral
Jonathan treats me like a young little girl--,anger
the child that needs to be led.,neutral
"And that's so annoying,",anger
because I'm not here to be a sheep.,anger
"So I'm fine with targeting Drea,",neutral
but Jonathan's really getting to me.,anger
"Yeah, but he said I can't tell you,",neutral
"- so... he...- Wait, he really did?",surprise
You don't know this.You don't...,anger
I don't even knowwhat you're talking about.,anger
"- Yeah.- But here's the thing,",neutral
I know Drea.,neutral
Drea has been wanting to make a move on me.,surprise
"I know, and I know she'sgonna get in their heads.",surprise
"The only thing is,if they're gonna follow.",neutral
"After winning the first two individual immunities,",happiness
my biggest fear is that it'sgonna be like a no-brainer.,fear
"Oh, Tori doesn't have an idol.She doesn't have an advantage.",sadness
Let's just get her out now.,fear
But somehow they're finally willing to make a move,surprise
and to make it on Drea.,neutral
"And as long as they stick with the plan,",neutral
I still have hope in this game.,happiness
"We can either do Maryanne,which I'm fine with...",neutral
Do you want Maryanne out?,anger
I think that it'd be good to get rid of the idol.,anger
"I do, too.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
- - You've got my word. - Awesome. You got mine.,happiness
"Getting split into two tribes totally sucks,",sadness
because none of these peopleare really my close allies.,neutral
"But then Jonathan said, ""It's Maryanne.""",surprise
"Instantly, I was like, ""Okay, awesome.""",happiness
"However, that's, like, a red flag for me",fear
when I hear that they're voting out people who have idols.,surprise
"'Cause I'm like,""Uh... this girl has one, too.""",surprise
"So let me tell you,",neutral
"- if you could just hear me out, okay?- Yeah. Mm.",neutral
We have an opportunity to take out Drea.,anger
Okay.,neutral
"So, yeah,three of us are voting Drea,",neutral
and she's voting Maryanne.,neutral
"- Okay. Okay.- This could be a huge move for us,",happiness
"because there'sonly gonna be eight left,",neutral
and the Taku fourwould still be here.,sadness
- And we have an extra vote and an idol.- Uh-huh. Right. Yes.,surprise
So we can make itto the top four,happiness
if we play our cards right.You down?,happiness
"- So, we get rid of Drea...- Mm-hmm.",neutral
- ...to flush the idol out.- Done.,neutral
"But if she chooses to play it, Maryanne would be out,",neutral
and we would lose that extra vote and an idol.,fear
Let's think about thatfor a second.,neutral
Jonathan is not very strategic.,disgust
"But he's not thinking things all the way through,",neutral
"because if Drea plays her idol,Maryanne's gone.",fear
So how are we gonna keepthe Taku four?,neutral
"And if he really is trying to be Taku strong,",neutral
we need a contingency plan.,fear
"I can convince Drea to vote Tori,",anger
because they already hate each other.,anger
"So me and Drea vote Tori,",neutral
and the three of you vote Drea.,anger
So here's the thing. Tori will tell Drea.,neutral
No.,neutral
- She could.- Why?,surprise
- Because Maryanne...- She doesn't like Drea.,disgust
"- She would not say it to Drea.- Well, you don't, t-truly, you don't know that.",neutral
I know more than you know that.But that's... and that's...,sadness
I'm giving you... And that's whyI'm having you trust me.,surprise
"Like, trust methat the information",neutral
- that I've been getting...- We're not supposed to trust anybody out here.,fear
"Correct, but Tori knowsthat she's been on the bottom.",sadness
"I don't thinkshe would warn her,",fear
'cause she knows thatshe'd be the other option.,sadness
You're not listening to me.,anger
Tori is not trustworthy.,anger
"Jonathan's impossible to talk with,",anger
and he's not understanding thatthere's a lot more relationships,anger
that he's not aware of.,neutral
"It's not that I trust her,",neutral
I'm saying we needa backup plan.,neutral
"You're not listening.You're getting really worked up,",anger
and it's hardto communicate with you,anger
"- when you, when you go a million miles a minute.- Sorry.",neutral
I don't think she's gonna play her idol.,fear
I think she's just gonna go home.,neutral
"Being the only man,",neutral
"he feels like a top dog right now,",happiness
and he's not listening to me.,anger
Mm-hmm.,neutral
"Most people that get immunity,",neutral
they relaxand they take it easy.,happiness
I think this is the best timeto go hard in the paint.,happiness
"And if they listen to me, we're going to the end.",surprise
"If we get Tori out,",anger
"you have your idol,",happiness
"Drea has her idol,and we have more power.",anger
"I'm hyped that there'sa big move that's gonna be made,",happiness
and I get to orchestrate it.,happiness
"I've been waiting for this moment,",happiness
and I'm gonna love every minute of it.,happiness
All right.,neutral
"Before we get intothe dynamics of the vote,",neutral
I never want to take for granted,neutral
that you guysare living in this.,neutral
- Yep.- You're not going back to a cozy cabin.,sadness
"Put on some music,crank up the fireplace.",happiness
You're going back to this.,anger
Hai is shivering.,fear
Your entire body is moving.,surprise
I have no body fat left.,sadness
"Watching this on TV is amazing,",happiness
but beingout here right now sucks.,sadness
"But, Jeff,when you get through it,",neutral
you learn that there'spart of in you that can,neutral
push further than you would haveever been pushed in real life.,fear
"And while it sucks now,the lifelong lesson",sadness
is greaterthan the sucky moment.,happiness
"So, Mike, you go backto the old Taku camp,",neutral
and you only have five people.,neutral
It's a new dynamic again.,surprise
"Well, here's the deal, Jeff.",neutral
You-you go to sleep at night,neutral
"and, quite frankly,you're not comfortable here.",anger
"So you wake up,and what you do is,",neutral
you start going throughthe different evolutions,neutral
of this gamethat you want to play.,neutral
And you do it overand over and over again.,anger
"You put everybody there,you think about everybody,",anger
"what... who they are,what they do.",surprise
Then you get out thereand you go to a challenge,neutral
and you realize all the thingsthat you calculated...,sadness
...gets thrown out the door.,anger
And then we only havemaybe two to three hours,fear
"before we're back here,voting on somebody.",anger
And we have to do it now.,anger
"Right now, in the rain,on Survivor.",surprise
"Hai, that was a great summationwhat a, what a day can be like.",happiness
"You wake up with plan A,and then you get plan B.",surprise
"Yeah, especially on this season,",neutral
where luck and your destiny,surprise
are completelyout of your control sometimes.,sadness
"You know, we all woke upwith an idea",neutral
"of what we wanted to doat this Tribal,",neutral
but everyone had to adaptand be flexible.,neutral
"So, Rocksroy, how fast isthe game shifting for you?",surprise
"Uh, I think todaywe were actually",neutral
"a little bit more mellow, Jeff,to be quite honest.",neutral
"Really?Uh, we were...",surprise
- But we were...- With only five people?,surprise
With only five people.,neutral
"We spent a lot of timejust eating coconuts,",happiness
not even reallytrying to strategize,neutral
as much as you would think.,neutral
Do you think that's a little bitlike a game of chicken?,surprise
"It could be, or it could be that",neutral
some of us have an understandingon what's gonna happen tonight.,surprise
"Mike, there it is.",surprise
"Everybody has to believethey have an understanding,",neutral
"because otherwise,now with the Shot in the Dark,",neutral
everybodycould screw the game up.,fear
So the lying has to be so good.,anger
"Yeah, and it's tough.",neutral
"We don't know,'cause he's right.",neutral
We didn't scatter today.,sadness
We just played it safe.,neutral
"And then-- you're right,it may be a game of chicken.",surprise
I only know what I'm gonna do.,neutral
"So, Romeo,",surprise
if you had to categorizeor give a flavor,neutral
"to this afternoon,how would you label it?",neutral
"Well, I justfound it interesting,",surprise
"you know,that it's an all-male tribe.",neutral
"And, like, everyone just didthe whole male thing, and...",disgust
"""Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. All right.""",neutral
And then just went backto talking about life.,neutral
It was very interesting.,surprise
Very different dynamicwith no women on this tribe.,surprise
"So, Rocksroy,when you hear Romeo say that,",neutral
"all of you guys kind of did the""What's up? What's up?""",neutral
Is that in your wheelhouse?,neutral
"As Romeo said, we kindof acted like guys today.",neutral
"We kind of, like,dismissed that we really",neutral
"had a big decision to make,and we weren't gonna go off",neutral
and-and talk to each other.,neutral
"But from what I saw today,I didn't see anything",neutral
that changed my mindto think that,surprise
what I came in thinkingtonight would be would change.,surprise
"All right, then.It is time to vote.",neutral
"Rocksroy, you're up.",neutral
I'll go tally the votes.,neutral
All right.If anybody has an advantage,neutral
"or an idol,and you want to play it,",neutral
now would be the time to do so.,neutral
"All right, I'll read the votes.",surprise
First vote.,neutral

"That's two votes Rocksroy,one vote Romeo.",neutral
Ninth person voted out andthe second member of our jury--,surprise

"Thank you, Jeff.Bye, Rocks.",neutral
"Good luck, guys.Thanks, Rocks.Bye, Rocks.",happiness

"Rocksroy voted out,second member of the jury.",sadness
There were some reactionsas you walked in.,surprise
"Drea, is thata surprising vote?",surprise
"Yes, definitely to me.",neutral
So what does that tell you?,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
"Lindsay, it's just a reminder",neutral
that the game is constantlychurning and turning over.,surprise
"Yeah, it just threw us off guard",surprise
"from what our plan wasfor the five of us here,",neutral
because we kind ofall had an assumption,neutral
of where that five was going.,surprise
So I think it'slingering a little longer.,neutral
"So, Drea, what do you have to do",neutral
"when you're forced to adaptwith this small of a group,",neutral
"some of whomyou may have an alliance with,",neutral
some of whom you may not?,surprise
You have to go backto the drawing board,anger
"and basically see, like,where you fit in.",neutral
"And now, as I look and I see",surprise
two people over therethat I really,neutral
"did not think would beover there so soon,",surprise
it changes your mindset.,surprise
From what?Conservative to aggressive?,neutral
From trusting to not trusting?,fear
I don't know yet.,neutral
"And, Tori, that could begood news or bad news,",neutral
depending on which sideof the vote,neutral
you were onwhen you walked in.,surprise
"Right. I actually, I see thiswhole twist as good news,",happiness
"because it, like,frees people up.",neutral
"And now, like, you get a chanceto work with people",happiness
that might not haveworked with you before,surprise
because there wasthis bigger majority.,neutral
"It's terrifying. Don't get mewrong, it's terrifying,",fear
'cause our odds are nowone-in-four of going home.,sadness
"Like, that is terrifying.",fear
"And, Jeff, Survivor players who are great",neutral
need to look a step ahead.,surprise
Just because we'reisolated in the five,neutral
doesn't mean thatwe're always going to be,neutral
isolated in the five.,sadness
"So what's the best votemoving forward,",neutral
in addition to what happenedat the previous Tribal?,surprise
Because we havethat information now.,neutral
"So, Drea, the Rocksroy votecould influence this vote.",surprise
"Yeah, definitely.",neutral
"And I was so proud because,you know, like,",happiness
we have four Black contestantsin Survivor.,surprise
"And then it alwayshappens where, at one point,",neutral
"the Black contestants getbooted out, boom, boom, boom.",anger
And then it's exactlywhat this is right now.,surprise
"So, yeah, I'm pissed.",anger
"So, do you thinkit's race-related?",neutral
"I think it's just subconsciouslya little bit of that,",neutral

"I don't think it's necessary, but...",neutral
That's becauseshe's not in my shoes.,anger
"But that's okay.No, I know,",neutral
"but it doesn't change my vote, so...",neutral

"And, Tori,",neutral
"so far, you're the only onenot in this conversation.",surprise

I can't do it.I'm over it.,sadness
"So, like, we can figuresomething else out,",neutral
"but I, morally,cannot write her name down.",sadness
