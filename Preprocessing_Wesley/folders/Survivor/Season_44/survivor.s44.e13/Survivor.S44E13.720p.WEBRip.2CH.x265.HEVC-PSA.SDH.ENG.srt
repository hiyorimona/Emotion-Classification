Welcome to the season finale

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,374
of Survivor 44.

3
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:08,342
Well, great players
make great seasons,

4
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:11,079
and this group
has delivered every day.

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,971
It's been an unpredictable
season of Survivor,

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,484
starting with three medical
visits in our first three days.

7
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:18,686
There's been a lot
of well-crafted blindsides,

8
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:21,021
ever-shifting alliances.

9
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:22,890
We even had a little romance.

10
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,659
But now we are down to five
and once again,

11
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,896
they'll be starting over
on a new beach with no shelter.

12
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,998
Tonight, we'll have
two immunity challenges,

13
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:34,135
two Tribal Councils,
and one fire-making showdown.

14
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:36,804
Then we will read the votes
here in beautiful Fiji

15
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:40,308
and crown a winner
of Survivor 44.

16
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,076
We'll immediately
go into the aftershow,

17

this could still play out.

22
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,891
And only one question
left to answer:

23
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,728
Who will be the Sole Survivor?

24
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:04,232

It seems as though there are

174
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,880
three Tika members
who are running the show, so,

175
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,382
I need to break that bond there.

176
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,387
...us three
would make it this far?

177
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:36,389
Yeah. Look at.
We're the Three Stooges

178
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:38,191
still here.

179
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,152
- What...
- I'm feeling really nervous about today, y'all.

180
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,830
Like, really nervous.

181
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,533
I'm gonna keep saying this.
Carson's gonna beat us.

182
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,770
Carson is a unanimous threat.

183
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,372
Everyone thinks
that Carson is a threat.

184
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,374
Carson has been
in every single vote.

185
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,977
Carson has been
on the right side every time.

186
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,979
Everyone loves him.

187
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,216
Carson is everyone's
little brother or Carolyn's son.

188
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,653
And I also think
that Carson believes that

189
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,655
he can beat me
in the end of the game.

190
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:10,090
He's gonna be a threat
in the end.

191
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,860
- But I didn't trust... I know.
- He's gonna knock all of us out.

192
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,795
- Yeah.
- Every... He's voted correctly...

193
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,263
Every single time.

194
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,566
CAROLYN:
Carson is 100% loyal to me,

195
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,268
and I believe he thinks that
I would always be loyal to him.

196
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,137
But now I'm thinking about,
like, the endgame.

197
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,439
I'm trying to weigh it all out,
but I do believe that

198
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,942
Carson is the biggest threat
out of everyone.

199
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,078
He's played the best game.
He speaks the best.

200
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,380
He is so articulate, he's so...

201
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,482
He's just the sweetie pie.
He would win.

202
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,587
How are you feeling?

203
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,355
I'm pretty nervous.
I think you're the name

204
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,691
I've been hearing, and I...

205
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,458
and you're probably
hearing my name.

206
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:47,619
- I think you're a big... you're a big threat.
- You and me.

207
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,763
- Me and you, you know.
- Yeah, for sure.

208
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,098
Most definitely.

209
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,432
CARSON: I feel like

210
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,335
Lauren has played
a good game, but

211
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,605
I think everyone here knows
that I can beat them.

212
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:00,307
And so, I am worried
about where things could go

213
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,110
considering how sporadic
my own alliance is.

214
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,479
Carolyn and Yam Yam are the
people I have to worry about

215
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,682
most in terms
of flipping or flopping.

216
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,418
Well, I'm banking
on winning immunity.

217

All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

224
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,869
First things first, Lauren,

225
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,571
- got to take it back again.
- (groans, laughs)

226
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:11,278
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

227
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,280
For today's challenge,

228
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,083
you're gonna race
through a massive,

229
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:20,220
three-level obstacle,
collecting keys along the way.

230
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,322
You'll grab
your last key using a pole.

231
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:26,426
Once you have your keys,
you'll unlock a chest,

00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,830
use the rope inside
to drop a ladder.

233
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,633
You'll climb the ladder
to the top of a tower

234
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:37,470
and race
to solve a Survivor puzzle.

235
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,343
First person
to finish wins immunity,

236
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,079
is guaranteed
a spot in the final four.

237
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,749
The final four is unique

238
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,417
because you can't be voted out.

239
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,185
You will either win

240
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,605
that final four
immunity challenge

241
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,488
and earn your way to the three,

242
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,124
somebody will take you
to the three,

243
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,959
or you will fight
in a fire-making showdown

244
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,493
to get to three.

245
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,963
But it won't be because
somebody wrote your name down

what's represented here today.

00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,989
You got to get that last key.

345
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,991
- (yells)
- Fling it!

346
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:27,260
It is Heidi, Carson.

347
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,220
- HEIDI: We got this.
- And Lauren on the puzzle.

348
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,232
Here comes Yam Yam. He's gonna
be in on the puzzle now.

349
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,866
- (yelling)
- PROBST: There it is!

350
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,869
- Carolyn! Carolyn has her fourth and final key.
- (yells)

351
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,399
Heidi trying to find another
piece, and she's got one.

352
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,677
It's Heidi trying
to catch Carson,

353
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,080
Yam Yam trying to catch Heidi,

354
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,283
- Lauren trying to get in it.
- Jeff, am I still in this?

355
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,186
You are, Carolyn.
One step at a time.

356
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,055
- (whoops)
- Drop that ladder first.

357
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:58,891
It is Carson in the lead,
but Heidi right on his tail.

358
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,294
This is close.

359
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,464
Carolyn drops her ladder.

360
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,766
- There you go!
- I just want to get up there.

361
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,735
PROBST: It is Carson
barely in the lead,

362
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,304
maybe one or two pieces.

363
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,940
And Yam Yam not far behind.

364
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,908
Yam Yam making a go of this.

365
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:19,212
This challenge is far from over.
You are in it.

366
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,048
Here comes Carolyn.

367
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,717
Everybody gonna be in
on the puzzle now.

368
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,953
Final five, day 24,

369
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:30,757
Survivor 44. You win this,
you're in the four.

370
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,460
You can't be voted out.

371
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,762
Carson has completed the circle,

372
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,466
the outer edges. Now he's got
the middle to fill in.

373
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,969
You get to four,
anything can happen.

374
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,174
Carson's struggle now
is keeping that puzzle together.

375
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:50,477
He's got a flimsy
outside structure.

376
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,280
Heidi still fighting
with another piece.

377
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,749
Heidi working to catch Carson.
Can she do it?

378
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,786
Yam Yam has hit a roadblock.

379
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,089
- Lauren has slowed down.
- Come on, Lauren.

380
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,523
You can't slow down very long
in this challenge,

381
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,326
or you're out of it.

382
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,560
What am I doing?

383
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,188
PROBST: Carson getting
closer and closer to the finish,

384
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,532
if he can
keep his puzzle together.

385
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,171
The hardest part about
building it from the outside

386
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,739
is what Carson is gonna battle,

387
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,674
and that is
keeping the pieces together

388
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,444
when you add another one
in the middle.

389
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,113
Carson with another piece.

390
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,780
He's down to three pieces.

391
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,484
Heidi unable
to gain ground on him.

392
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,920
Oh, yes!
Okay, I got one. I'm happy.

393
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,856
I'm... I am really proud
of myself right now.

394
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,991
PROBST:
Carson down to his last piece.

395
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,393
Come on, Carson.

396
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,529
- I see it.
- For the win.

397
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,398
Jeff.

398
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,933
Carson has it!

399
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,636
- Carson wins his second.
- Good job!

400
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,238
-Individual immunity,
-Thank you.

401
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,740
Guaranteeing him a spot
in the final four.

402
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,143
- Ah!
- Good job.

403
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,246
PROBST: And lots of different
ways he could get to three

404
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:02,915
where he could plead his case
to the jury. Wow.

405
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,687
All right, Carson, come on over.

406
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,289
- Yes.
- (Carson laughs)

407
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,292
- Good job, baby.
- Thank you.

408
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,464
For the second time, Carson,
individual immunity is yours.

409
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,732
You are safe.
You are in the four. You have

410
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,959
a big decision to make 'cause
you're going to the sanctuary

411
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,841
where you're gonna refuel
not just your spirit,

412
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,772
- Mm-hmm.
- But your body.

413
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:28,475
- Yeah. Right.
- Pasta, carrot cake,

414
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,578
chocolate cake.
Choose one person,

415
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,347
and you're only
going to bring one person.

416
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,216
So, two people are gonna
go to the sanctuary.

417
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,218
Three are gonna
be left behind at camp

418
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,852
to conspire
or do whatever they do.

419
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,989
- CARSON: Yeah.
- PROBST: Who's it gonna be?

420
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,493
I'm sorry to everyone,
but Yam Yam, you're my pick.

421
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,196
- Sorry, guys.
- PROBST: Yam Yam, come on over.

422
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,730
CARSON: I'm sorry.

423
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,699
- It's okay.
- Good. Go.

424
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,201
Ooh!

425
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,303
Oh, thank you.

426
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,871
PROBST: All right.
Grab your stuff, head out.

427
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,831
Boat will take you to the
sanctuary where you will have

428
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,442
a great afternoon.
You will return

429
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,477
back in time for Tribal Council.

430
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:05,970
- All right. - Thank you, Jeff.
- Thank you, Jeff. Thank you.

431
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,605
- PROBST: Enjoy. Well earned.
- Love you.

432
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,749
Good job.

433
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,251
Carolyn, Lauren, Heidi,

434
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,785
Tribal Council tonight

435
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,655
where somebody will be
the 14th person voted out

436
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,690
of Survivor 44.

437
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,150
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

438
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,993
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

439
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,396
CARSON: To actually pull out
the win when I needed it most

440
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,133
in this game...
It feels incredible.

441
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,834
And to know
that I have a guaranteed spot

442
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,704
in the final four
and no one can vote me out?

443
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,706
I mean, I'm just so proud

444
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,008
of pushing myself
to get to this point.

445
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,379
So now, I need to set myself up
in the best position

446
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,581
I can be in
in order to win this game.

447
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,716
♪ ♪

448
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,992
♪ ♪

449
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,596
- (Carson sighs, gasps)
- (Yam Yam laughs)

450
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,698
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh.

451
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,567
CARSON: So happy. (Laughs)

452
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,968
Yes.

453
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,570
CARSON: Going to the sanctuary,

454
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,173
where good things happen,
I was ecstatic.

455
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,534
- YAM YAM: You're gonna take the cake now? Yes!
- Of course.

456
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,035
- Yes!
- You're kidding? That's what I start with.

457
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,546
I mean, I was in heaven.

458
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,748
And to know that
by winning the necklace,

459
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,050
I'm going to the final four

460
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,652
feels pretty amazing.

461
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,490
We are.

462
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,824
Yes. This is awesome.

463
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,293
YAM YAM:
We're like this crazy duo

464
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,895
going into a pasta dinner date.
It's so much fun.

465
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,330
I was so

466
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,565
freaking happy when
I saw all that food. I was like,

467
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:33,800
"Oh, my God."

468
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,502
Yeah. I'm so happy.

469
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,169
Salud.

470
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,772
But the most important thing
was we had the opportunity

471
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,375
to talk about what we're gonna
do tonight at Tribal Council.

472
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:45,378
How should we go about today?

473
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,947
So, the biggest threat
is Carolyn.

474
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,551
I get that Carolyn
has played an idol,

475
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,120
but is she really a threat?

476
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,300
- Do you... I mean, she might be... I...
- I think...

477
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,328
Mm-hmm.

478
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,662
It was, yeah.

479
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,397
And I think
people are gonna like that.

480
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,633
But I think
between Carolyn and Lauren,

481
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,901
Carolyn is the biggest threat.

482
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,603
She says
she's not playing a big game,

483
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,405
but we all know
she's playing a big game.

484
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,808
She's just being loud and crazy
about it, but that's her game.

485
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,478
She wants us to believe
that she's not in control,

486
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,447
but she knows
exactly what she's doing.

487
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,886
But I feel like the Tika Three

488
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,156
have a better shot
against ourselves than we would

489
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,925
against Heidi
or definitely Lauren.

490
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,226
Now, Lauren needs to go.

491
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,429
I feel like
there's one big target,

492
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,531
and that's Lauren. Lauren has

493
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,999
played a great game.

494
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,535
In addition
to winning immunity twice,

495
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,670
she's also played

496
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,672
a game based off
of building bonds

497
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,407
with people and friendships.

498
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:51,378
So, Lauren has a lot
of friends on the jury, so,

499
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,179
Lauren could get a lot
of jury votes.

500
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,384
So, tonight, Heidi, me,
you, Carolyn, vote Lauren.

501
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,486
Heidi might do
something different,

502
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:03,089
but I don't see why anyone would
want to go a different way.

503
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,092
The only way Lauren survives
tonight is if she has an idol.

504
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,660
YAM YAM: I needed Carson

505
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,596
to work with me
to get Carolyn out,

506
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,631
but he's not having it.

507
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:14,501
I think it's a mistake,
but Carson is like,

508
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:18,871
"It has to be Lauren,"
so, what am I gonna do?

509
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,107
I hope it doesn't bite me
in the ass, you know?

510
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,549
CAROLYN: Oh, my gosh.

511
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,017
HEIDI: Crazy.

512
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,486
So, Carolyn, I'm confused

513
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,622
why he didn't take you
and he took Yam Yam.

514
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:40,092
You saved Carson, so I-I would
have guessed it was you.

515
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,495
Yeah, I don't know.

516
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,835
I mean, I think they're working
very closely together.

517
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,770
- Yeah.
- And it's gonna be...

518
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,672
most likely me.

519
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,942
Tonight is definitely hard, not
having the immunity necklace.

520
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,178
I know that people want me out
because I have

521
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,448
two immunity wins,
I won one reward

522
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:04,517
and I have a lot of allies
on the jury.

523
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,553
So I think that I am a threat,

524
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:08,555
and other people
know it as well.

525
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:12,324
So, if I don't find an idol
or come up with something,

526
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,326
I think they're gonna
vote me out tonight.

527
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,197
I'm pretty positive. (Laughs)

528
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,225
- I-I don't want to be...
- HEIDI: It's an opportunity

529
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,669
for us to come up
with something.

530
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,128
- CAROLYN: I don't want to be...
- HEIDI: At this point...

531
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,430
I mean, the only person
we can get is Yam Yam.

532
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:27,373
- CAROLYN: Mm-hmm.
- LAUREN: But I don't know

533
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:30,009
because the last vote,
I wasn't in on the vote.

534
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,712
- HEIDI: I wanted Carson out the previous vote.
- What...

535
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,582
You.

536
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,750
The vote was you.

537
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,756
Carolyn is more dangerous
than Carson.

538
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,993
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

539
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,001
CAROLYN: Lauren
told me that last Tribal,

540
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,003
Yam Yam was
putting my name out there.

541
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,506
Up until now, I felt

542
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,874
solid with Yam Yam and Carson,

543
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,911
but it sounds like
they might be up to something.

544
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:06,312
There's always a possibility,

545
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,605
and even
if it's like a one percent

546
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:10,416
or two percent,
it still scares me!

547
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:13,419
Hey, I'm dependent on y'all.
If y'all don't vote Yam Yam,

548
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,221
- then...
- I feel like.

549
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,689
Yam Yam's a way bigger threat.

550
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,791
Isn't that what we're doing
at this point, or no?

551
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,651
- Yam Yam is in with everybody.
- HEIDI: I'm trying to think.

552
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,161
CAROLYN: Look at him at Tribals.

553
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,731
- Everyone's laughing, loving him.
- Yeah. I'm-I'm...

554
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,768
- Exactly.
- Should we just...

555
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:39,345
I've been with Yam Yam
from the beginning,

556
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,548
and I thought
we were going to the end,

557
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:45,284
but if he's putting my name
out there, everything changes.

558
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,721
Maybe I will vote for Yam Yam.

559
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,732
LAUREN: Hello!

560
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,934
How are y'all feeling?

561
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,837
- Oh, God.
- Good. It was... it was yummy.

562
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,708
YAM YAM: Hi.

563
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,792
YAM YAM: I come back from
the reward, and I see Heidi,

564
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:27,860
Lauren and Carolyn sitting

565
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,429
by the fire eating rice,
being all sneaky.

566
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:33,065
And they look at me
super awkward. I'm like,

567
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,702
"What's going on?"

568
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:39,606
(chopping continues)

569
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:43,976
YAM YAM: I have to say it
feels awkward coming back.

570
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,678
I feel, like, guilty.

571
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,626
I'm immune.
I have no reason to lie.

572
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:00,927
I'm voting for Lauren,

573
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:03,062
regardless
of whatever else happens.

574
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,831
If we look at the jury,

575
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:08,935
like, I don't...
There's... logic.

576
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:14,406
Although, the other option
is me, which I know.

577
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,467
- And it's a good possibility.
- Thing is that...

578
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,647
The thing is that...

579
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,850
YAM YAM:
Carolyn, what are you doing?

580
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,242
Are you trying
to put my name out there?

581
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,653
I guess you are 'cause

582
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,554
you're never like this.
So the first thing

583
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:31,123
I think is like,
"Oh, my God, I'm in trouble."

584
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,296
It's, like, weird.
Like, I go to camp, and...

585
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,923
- No one's talking to me.
- It was weird.

586
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,867
Yeah, very weird.

587
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:44,036
I feel like something's up.

588
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,338
Fact that Lauren hasn't even
talked to me,

589
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,407
not even tried.

590
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,409
Like, I've never seen
someone give up.

591
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,936
Maybe she's not giving up.
She knows something else is...

592
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:54,480
Mm-hmm, that's
what I'm thinking.

593
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,450
I know.

594
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,921
If Carolyn and Heidi
are dumb enough

595
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,390
to actually take Lauren...

596
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:06,793
Yeah.

597
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,594
Carolyn... I don't know.

598
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,697
She drives me crazy sometimes
to work with

599
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,565
because she doesn't
have a filter, and

600
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,502
she is unpredictable, doing
random things all the time.

601
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,604
And now, she's causing paranoia

602
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:20,139
to where I'm not really sure

603
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,274
voting Lauren out
is the best option.

604
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,737
I was thinking. I was like,
"Hey, would it make sense

605
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,816
"to talk to Lauren
and tell her to vote

606
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:32,451
for someone else just in case?"

607
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,562
CARSON: I think that
might be a better play

608
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,331
than letting her
just vote for you.

609
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:48,600
YAM YAM:
The plan is to vote for Lauren.

610
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:50,402
Lauren is a big threat
to win this game.

611
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,506
But I need to make sure
that if Lauren plays an idol,

612
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,308
I don't get voted out.

613
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,310
And if that means
Carolyn goes instead of me,

614
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,013
I'm okay with that.

615
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,627
Yeah.

616
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:17,764
It's me or you.

617
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,098
(laughing): Yeah.

618
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,100
(chopping resumes)

619
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,438
LAUREN: I...

620
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,275
He's not...

621
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:38,785
I'll be willing
to vote wherever.

622
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,787
Yam Yam and Carolyn...

623
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:42,588
They're throwing out
each other's name,

624
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,924
but I don't know
what to believe.

625
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,558
They bicker a lot, but

626
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,061
I think it's like a family
bickering, you know? Like,

627
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,863
I argue with my sister
all the time,

628
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,865
and we come back together,
and we-we know

629
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:56,235
that we still have this bond
that's deeper than the fighting.

630
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:57,870
So I think maybe
that's what it is.

631
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,830
You know, there's deep bonds
here. There's deep connections,

632
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:02,641
and... but deep down
inside, I think

633
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,301
they're still together
as one Tika family.

634
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:07,679
So, at this point,
the only way to make sure

635
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,917
that I stay in this game
is to find an idol.

636
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,823
I just keep thinking
about my family.

637
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:20,592
And my sons,
before I came out here said,

638
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,286
"Finding the idol is like
playing hide-and-seek.

639
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:25,364
You know, like, the idols are
hiding, and you are seeking."

640
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,433
So, I'm a fighter
so I'm not gonna give up.

641
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:30,136
I'm fighting for my boys.
I'm fighting for my family.

642
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:32,138
Like, this is
what I am here for,

643
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,898
and I'm gonna do everything
I can to make it

644
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,542
to the end.

645
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,132
I'm just worried. I'm, like...

646
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,939
CARSON: Yeah.

647
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,341
Tonight is
a very important vote.

648
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,144
This will determine who's
going to be in the final four.

649
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:16,015
For me, the best route
is to try to keep Tika intact.

650
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:19,818
But Carolyn is clearly
upset with Yam Yam, so,

651
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,653
who knows what Carolyn could do?

652
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,824
CAROLYLN: I'm not kidding.

653
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,526
I'm not, either.

654
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,162
CARSON: It's crazy that
with only five people left,

655
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:31,898
it could be
so up in the air right now.

656
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:35,234
I've always felt like I've known
where the votes are going,

657
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,669
but this time,
other than myself,

658
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,172
anyone could be going home.

659
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:52,084
♪ ♪

660
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,946
All right.
So let's start with Carson.

661
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:22,514
Because, Carson,
by winning immunity today,

662
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,651
you guarantee yourself
a spot in the final four.

663
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,253
You cannot be voted out.

664
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,433
You will either win your way,
somebody will take you,

665
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,423
or you'll make fire
and have a shot at it,

666
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:34,961
which makes tonight's vote
so important, Lauren.

667
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,963
Was it crazy at camp knowing

668
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:40,099
that "if I can
just get to four..."

669
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,733
You're already laughing.

670
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,403
LAUREN: To be 100%
honest, I don't think it was

671
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,605
crazy or chaotic at camp
or anything.

672
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,640
I'm... Jeff,
I'm probably the one

673
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,542
that's gonna go home tonight.

674
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,978
PROBST: How do you know that?

675
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,579
- What transpired?
- Because, I mean,

676
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,081
we have three Tikas here.

677
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:56,648
They're all close.

678
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,384
They're connected,
they're aligned.

679
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:02,521
My girl Jaime left yesterday,
and I have a target on me,

680
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,324
and it's just been known.
No one came to speak to me,

681
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,127
which was kind of weird
to me just because,

682
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:11,030
like, if I'm the one
going to the jury,

683
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,565
you would want
to be talking to me, right?

684
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,301
- Nobody t... Okay.
- I did. - I did.

685
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,037
They-they talked to me,

686
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,371
but it wasn't like a,

687
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,640
"This is who we're gonna
vote for tonight."

688
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,375
I felt like
we had conversations.

689
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:26,778
Yeah, I'm shocked.
I really... I really am.

690
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,181
And I know, Lauren,
it's been hard,

691
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,418
me and you, with trust,
but I felt like today,

692
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:36,255
I know I took you aside, and
I made time to speak with you.

693
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:37,589
LAUREN: I... It wasn't like

694
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,558
the conversations
we would normally have.

695
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,061
You know, like, there was names.
There were names,

696
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,230
but it was just no solid plan.

697
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,265
I-I, like, I... I'm sh...

698
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:47,866
I really am. I-I...

699
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,136
I just... I didn't... I don't...

700
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:52,304
- I don't feel...
- I felt like we all talked.

701
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,475
PROBST:
Carson, something's off tonight.

702
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,111
It started from the moment
Lauren sat down and said,

703
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,680
"No one talked to me." And then,
suddenly, everybody said,

704
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,507
"What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?"

705
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,051
So what's going on
that I'm missing?

706
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:07,053
I'm not sure, Jeff. I feel like

707
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,055
there could be something
at play tonight.

708
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:12,691
Even Lauren not approaching me.
Like, if I were ever

709
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,760
in that position,
I'd be talking to everybody.

710
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,795
Maybe it is a facade.
I don't know.

711
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,532
PROBST: So, Heidi, is the threat

712
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,834
of an idol what is making this
so unsettling?

713
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,138
I think anybody here
could have an idol.

714
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,540
I think
we all search all day long,

715
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,576
so any of us.

716
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,769
- Not me.
- Could have something in their pocket right now.

717
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,080
It could be Lauren,

718
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,714
and it will be a great play
on her part

719
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,217
- if she does have something.
- Lauren, what do you make

720
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:40,086
about the uncertainty
that maybe you do

721
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,554
have an idol
and this is an elaborate ruse?

722
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,890
Yeah, I mean, we'll-we'll see.

723
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,692
We'll see.

724
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,094
PROBST: I will say

725
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,662
it's a testament
to the gameplay this season

726
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,564
that I think
it's very difficult right now

727
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:55,000
to know what the truth is.
I don't know

728
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:59,105
if this is vulnerability
meeting inevitability,

729
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,572
where Lauren's saying,
"It's over,

730
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,108
and I'm just gonna
let you see it,"

731
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,510
or if it's maybe
one of the biggest moves

732
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,279
about to happen because
nobody here seems to know

733
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,880
for sure if there's an idol,
and if so, who has it.

734
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,917
It definitely...

735
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,952
will be amazing

736
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,121
to see something happen.

737
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:18,257
But that "amazing"
might be me going home,

738
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,126
so I don't want that to happen.

739
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,128
So, Yam Yam,
you're saying tonight,

740
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:24,630
you think it is Lauren or you?

741
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,733
(sighs) From my reaction
coming into camp,

742
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,802
I feel like that,
'cause everybody knows

743
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,373
there's one plan, and one,
uh... and one plan B. Like,

744
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,641
let's get real, you know? Like,

745
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,476
that's what I feel,
and no offense to you,

746
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,911
because I feel like
I'm the other plan.

747
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,649
If it's me or if it's you,
it sucks that it's going down

748
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,484
like it happened today.

749
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,953
It-it shouldn't have happened.
Like, today,

750
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:50,456
the energy shouldn't have been
where it was.

751
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,761
I don't know. It's so hard.

752
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,164
I'm-I'm really taking this
very personal.

753
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:00,666
It's, like, really...
it-it hurt.

754
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,768
How are you feeling now, Lauren?

755
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:05,271
I mean,
I feel like I knew coming

756
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:07,339
into today,
if I didn't win, like,

757
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,741
it was gonna be it, so...

758
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,179
PROBST: And if you're
right, to get to day 24,

759
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:16,715
on one hand,
is pretty remarkable.

760
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,351
And I'm super proud.

761
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:24,690
(Lauren sniffling)

762
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:31,430
My main thing coming out here
was to know, like,

763
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,200
that my boys were gonna
be proud of me. (Cries)

764
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:36,268
And I think they will be.

765
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:39,271
Like, I was giving
Frannie vibes, man.

766
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,106
I won two immunities

767
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:43,475
and a reward.

768
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,677
Like, I feel like a boss,
you know?

769
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,347
Like, I did awesome out here,

770
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:51,883
and, like, I'm so proud

771
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,885
of just who I've become,
you know,

772
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,487
and, like,
how much I've grown here.

773
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,681
Like, I didn't think I was gonna
be able to do that, Jeff.

774
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:00,492
Like, did you see me? (Laughs)

775
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:01,593
I did.

776
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,496
I was killing it.

777
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,898
And, I mean, like,

778
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,901
I never would have imagined
to be here.

779
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,440
PROBST: I'm always
trying to find new ways

780
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,609
to connect to somebody who
thinks they might want to play.

781
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:20,246
That speech you just gave

782
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:22,881
is the best inspiration

783
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:25,551
for why to play,
and it was one sentence.

784
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,853
"I'm so proud
of who I have become."

785
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:29,255
Yeah.

786
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,257
- PROBST: Not who I was or am.
- Right.

787
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:34,426
"I became."
You transformed out here.

788
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,861
LAUREN: Most definitely.

789
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,264
Like, I'm a single mom, right?

790
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:40,098
So I'm like,
"I can do everything by myself.

791
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,133
I don't need anybody
to help me."

792
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:45,304
But then I realized very quickly
that I needed my Ratu people,

793
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,373
or I needed, like,
everybody here,

794
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:49,074
like, to help me get to the end,

795
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,543
and if it wasn't for them,
like, I wouldn't be here.

796
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,280
You know, and, like,
just transforming in that way

797
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:57,383
and realizing, like,
I don't need all of the extra.

798
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:58,842
And even my kids.
Like, they don't need all

799
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,124
of the extra things that I'm...

800
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:01,953
I'm continuously trying
to give them.

801
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,290
Like, I work so hard
each and every day

802
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,158
to provide for them, and, like,
I go above and beyond.

803
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:08,760
But even knowing that, like,

804
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,296
we don't even need
all of those things.

805
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,298
Like, we can survive just off

806
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:15,801
of, like, very little
and still be happy. (Crying)

807
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:19,605
It's amazing, and this
experience has just been, like,

808
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:23,108
life-changing for me,
and I'm so thankful

809
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,610

00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,002
Are those tears in your eyes?

855
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:14,339
Yeah. (Laughs) Yeah.

856
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:18,644
♪ ♪

857
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:22,848
Carolyn, what's the emotion
as you walked up the steps?

858
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:26,552
Um...

859
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:29,320
just walking up...

860
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,256
(sniffling) and knowing

861
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,124
that I would be here at the top.

862
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,893
And just...

863
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,795
that dream that I would be here,

864
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:38,697
but not necessarily thinking

865
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,832
that I could and that now I am.

866
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:43,201
It's just... it's overwhelming.

867
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,370
It's-it's...

868
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,573
There's just so much emotion,
and, like, we're up here

869
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:50,709
in this view, and, like,
we all just dreamed about this.

870
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,011
And it's just, we're here.
(sniffling)

871
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,680
I'm here.

872
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,582
PROBST: This makes me so happy

873
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:58,049
because you're right.

874
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,652
The view alone...
We saved this for the last

875
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,454
'cause it's the greatest view
in Fiji.

876
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:06,224
A classic Survivor challenge

877
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:09,327
has become one
of the most iconic challenges

878
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,829
in our arsenal.

879
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,130
You will compete for it.

880
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,465
Potentially worth
a million dollars.

881
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,202
Shall we get to your final
immunity challenge?

882
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:20,505
First things first.
Carson, I'm coming for it.

883
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:22,941
Like they say,
"You go to the power."

884
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,776
I'm coming to you.
You got the power.

885
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:33,118
For the last time,
immunity is back up for grabs.

886
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,811
For today's challenge,
you're gonna have one hand

887
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:36,888
tied behind your back.

888
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,324
On my go, you're gonna
drop a ball down a chute.

889
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:42,193
It will spiral to the bottom.

890
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,196
You'll catch it, put it back in.

891
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,832
At regular intervals,

892
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:50,201
we will add another ball,
making it more difficult.

893
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,470
If at any point a ball drops,

894
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:55,006
you're out.

895
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:58,376
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

896
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,746
is guaranteed a spot
at that final three,

897
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:03,348
where you will get a chance
to plead your case

898
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:07,218
to your jury
about why you deserve it...

899
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,655
The title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars.

900
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,890
Plus, you have all the power.

901
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,960
You decide who sits next to you
in that number two spot

902
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,664
and who you force to make fire
for the third and final spot.

903
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,766
Biggest challenge of the season.

904
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:23,568
All right, give you a minute
to get ready, and we'll go.

905
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:25,937
Let's do it!

906
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:37,683
All right, everybody is belted.

907
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:41,687
Got one hand behind your back.

908
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,421
We are ready to go.

909
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:46,124
Final four immunity challenge
begins right now.

910
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:48,226
Everybody grab one ball.

911
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:51,029
And drop it in your chute.

912
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,301
This challenge...

913
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:58,269
is on.

914
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,209
This is the easy part.

915
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,777
This is the warmup.

916
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,916
You don't want to drop here.
You have one job:

917
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:13,618
Just follow one ball.

918
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:16,287
Where it gets more difficult
is adding a second ball.

919
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:18,724
Huh.

920
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,760
The gates alternate
so it's always going to be

921
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,730
left, right,
left, right, left, right.

922
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,732
Remember that.

923
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:30,769
All about concentration.

924
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,504
If your ball drops, it's over.

925
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,406
Your fate will be in the hands

926
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,575
of somebody else.

927
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:39,778
Aah!

928
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,219
In a moment, you're gonna
add a second ball,

929
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,790
and you'll have 15 seconds

930
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,992
anywhere in that window.

931
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:56,127
And if you drop
during that window,

932
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:57,896
you're still out.

933
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,198
All right, you have 15 seconds

934
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:03,034
to add a second ball.

935
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,670
Carson drops. Heidi drops.

936
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:07,939
Carolyn drops. Yam Yam waiting.

937
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,176
He drops.
Everybody now with two balls.

938
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:15,814
Now it got
a little more difficult.

939
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,016
Now you have
to really pay attention.

940
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:20,151
- (screams)
- Carolyn,

941
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:22,053
remember...
Left, right, left, right.

942
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:23,521
(screaming)

943
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:25,791
That's it, Carolyn.

944
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:27,025
That's how you do it.

945
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,995
- (Carolyn yelps)
- Everybody looking great.

946
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:31,462
Stay on it. One gate,

947
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,699
then the other gate.
One gate, then the other gate.

948
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,701
Yam Yam Very calm.

949
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:39,805
Always trying
to improve your spacing.

950
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:42,240
You want as much time

951
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,242
in between balls as possible.

952
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:57,088
Day 25 of Survivor 44.

953
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:59,357
Heidi the only person

954
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,426
who has not won
individual immunity.

955
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:04,462
What a time
to win it right here.

956
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:11,002
Carolyn drops.

957
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,971
- She's the first out.
- Aah!

958
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:14,940
We're down to three.

959
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,908
(Carolyn grunts)

960
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:19,477
Carolyn, one tiny mistake.

961
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:22,047
It is now Carson, Heidi

962
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,415
and Yam Yam.

963
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,217
All right, in a moment,

964
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:27,853
we're going to add a third ball

965
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:30,255
and the pace is gonna
get a lot faster.

966
00:46:31,857 --> 00:46:33,758
You have 15 seconds

967
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:36,627
to add a third ball.

968
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,629
Heidi drops immediately.

969
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,398
So does Carson.

970
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:43,234
Yam Yam taking his time,
waiting.

971
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,171
Yam Yam drops.

972
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,638
Everybody now with three balls.

973
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:51,910
And now you can feel
the intensity kick in.

974
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,479
Balls are coming faster.

975
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,047
Got to respond more quickly.

976
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,216
♪ ♪

977
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,318
Stay on it.

978
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:03,121
This could be worth
a million dollars.

979
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:06,191
That's how much
is at stake right now.

980
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:29,280
You're doing great.

981
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,917
Do not trip.

982
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:37,488
All right,
you have 15 seconds to drop

983
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:41,426
a fourth ball
anytime in that window.

984
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:46,932
Heidi drops her fourth.

985
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:48,599
Carson has four.

986
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,668
Yam Yam has four.

987
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:53,972
Everybody now at four balls.

988
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:56,707
We're in it now.

989
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:03,048
Yam Yam drops.
He's out. We're down to two.

990
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:05,984
It is Carson and Heidi

991
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:08,119
fighting for immunity.

992
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,957
Stay on it, you two.

993
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:15,793
Keep fighting.
You got nothing else going on

994
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:19,597
in your life right now
but this challenge.

995
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,136
Carson is out! It's over!

996
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:29,307
- Heidi wins her first individual immunity!
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

997
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,977
- It could not come at a bigger time.
- HEIDI: Yes! Yes! Yes!

998
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:33,878
- Oh.
- PROBST: Guaranteed herself a spot

999
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:36,114
in the final three

1000
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:38,083
of Survivor 44.

1001
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:40,218
What a finish.

1002
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:42,988
(sighs)

1003
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,256
- Heidi, get over here.
- Ah!

1004
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:47,993
Aah! My girls are gonna scream.

1005
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:50,695
- Ah.
- I want to know this feeling.

1006
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:53,498
You did not win a challenge
until just now,

1007
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,500
and it couldn't be
a bigger challenge.

1008
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,303
- You are in the final three.
- Yes! Oh, my God!

1009
00:48:58,403 --> 00:48:59,637
Yeah, so...

1010
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:01,072
Yeah, I have the power.

1011
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:04,209
I have been so close
in every freaking challenge.

1012
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:06,811
It's like
I finally pulled through.

1013
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:10,215
I'm so blessed and excited.

1014
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:14,319
Wow! This is like
a dream come true on day 25!

1015
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:17,155
(sighs) - PROBST: Heidi,
you're in the final three.

1016
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:19,157
You will get a chance
tomorrow night

1017
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:21,326
to plead your case
to a jury of your peers

1018
00:49:21,426 --> 00:49:23,794
about why you deserve
to win this game.

1019
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,463
Before we get there,
though, tonight,

1020
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:28,099
you will decide
who gets the number two spot,

1021
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,435
- Mm-hmm.
- Who you bring with you to the final three,

1022
00:49:30,535 --> 00:49:33,904
and who you are gonna force
to make fire at Tribal Council

1023
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,174
to earn their way
into that final three spot.

1024
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:38,476
Unless I make fire.

1025
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,147
(sighs)

1026
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:43,739
- PROBST: Would be a big move.
- HEIDI: Yes.

1027
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:45,050
PROBST: And why?

1028
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:46,417
HEIDI: Um,

1029
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:47,843
a lot of people
have big résumés here.

1030
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:49,587
This builds and helps me.

1031
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:51,589
But making fire and winning it...

1032
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:54,059
It's like the cherry
on top of everything.

1033
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:56,061
So I would 100% consider it.

1034
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:58,596
I have not made my mind,
but I'm confident,

1035
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:01,132
so, who knows?
We'll see what happens tonight.

1036
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:03,134
All right,
everybody head back to camp.

1037
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:04,935
I will see you tonight
at Tribal Council

1038
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:06,716
for a big night.
Grab your stuff. Head out.

1039
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:08,804
- Congrats.
- Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

1040
00:50:11,076 --> 00:50:12,077
Ah!

1041
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:13,178
This is, like,

1042
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:15,113
that extra boost that I really

1043
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:18,316
needed to have the power
and the control of my own game.

1044
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:20,518
I have to really make
a humongous decision

1045
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:22,953
to see who I send to make fire.

1046
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:24,889
How do I position myself to win?

1047
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:27,892
Did I do good enough already,
or should I put myself

1048
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:30,495
and risk it
into the fire-making tonight?

1049
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,432
♪ ♪

1050
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:41,172
♪ ♪

1051
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:48,946
YAM YAM: Congratulations.

1052
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,085
CARSON: That's... Me, too.
That was awesome. Great job.

1053
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:57,155
HEIDI: Winning the very last
immunity challenge

1054
00:50:57,255 --> 00:51:00,024
feels amazing. And

1055
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:01,426
I'm pretty sure

1056
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:04,129
none of the Tika members
saw it coming.

1057
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:05,630
I mean, there's three of them,

1058
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,798
and all of a sudden,
the one that was flying solo

1059
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:11,569
has the power to decide
who's making fire tonight.

1060
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:12,837
- What?
- Oh!

1061
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:14,305
Yeah.

1062
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:18,143
L-Let me ask you guys,
anybody wants to make fire?

1063
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:19,544
Maybe make my life easier.

1064
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:21,779
Sounded like
you wanted to make fire.

1065
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:25,150
I am, I'm considering it,
but I just got to practice.

1066
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,510
- So if anybody, at some point...
- I like, I like making fire.

1067
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:29,620
Okay. Let's all practice
and let's see what happens.

1068
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,855
There's a lot

1069
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,723
on my mind right now.

1070
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,493
I just have to make sure
I do what's best

1071
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,163
to position myself
to win tomorrow.

1072
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:47,405
CARSON:
Not being able to pull through

1073
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:49,840
at the very last challenge
kind of sucked,

1074
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,043
but considering
no one can vote me out,

1075
00:51:53,178 --> 00:51:56,214
I at least
have a chance to make fire.

1076
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:58,849
So I'm trying to be optimistic.

1077
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,486
I know that
I am the biggest threat,

1078
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:04,189
so I'm just trying
to be as prepared as I can

1079
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:06,957
to go against whoever,
'cause I feel like,

1080
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:10,195
regardless of who it is,
I'm probably making fire.

1081
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:15,266
But I'm not very good at it,
I've figured out.

1082
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,001
(chuckles) It's so weird.

1083
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:20,571
I mean, I was able to make fire
in three minutes at home

1084
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,607
with a flint and machete,
and here

1085
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:24,542
I'm struggling.

1086
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,911
I haven't even gotten a flame.

1087
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:29,880
Maybe it's that I'm just

1088
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,216
not confident in myself.

1089
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:34,084
I do struggle
with self-confidence, um...

1090
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:39,056
And I've always been
someone who struggles with...

1091
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,392
...pulling through.

1092
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,429
And to think
that I would allow myself

1093
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:48,032
to fail at the very last second
just is heartbreaking,

1094
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:50,368
'cause I feel like
I will win the million

1095
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:52,403
if I get to the end. And just

1096
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,239
knowing that
I might not get there

1097
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:56,874
because of my own insecurities

1098
00:52:56,974 --> 00:53:00,245
is really hard. But

1099
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:01,779
I'm not gonna give up.

1100
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:05,250
I don't want to let
my own self get in the way

1101
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:08,085
of my success in this game.

1102
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:16,261
YAM YAM: It would be
the best game move for me

1103
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:18,128
to have that little notch
in my résumé...

1104
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:20,765
...of winning
the fire-making challenge.

1105
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:23,634
It's something that
everybody sees you do.

1106
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,794
Like, it's not something
that you go to Tribal Council,

1107
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:26,962
you tell the jury about.
It's something that

1108
00:53:27,004 --> 00:53:28,973
they're watching. So watching

1109
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:30,908
you make fire,
you're like, "Hey."

1110
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:32,910
That's my hero move, you know?

1111
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,000
But making fire
against someone from Tika...

1112
00:53:38,483 --> 00:53:40,017
...it's really emotional for me.

1113
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,754
You know, we talk about
Carson being this big threat.

1114
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:47,157
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, well, how do I know that Heidi really thinks that,

1115
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:49,093
- you know?
- Mm-hmm.

1116
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:51,128
You think you're going tonight?

1117
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:53,364
I-I don't know.

1118
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:55,433
I do know that people think

1119
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,802
that you can
make fire really well.

1120
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,371
CAROLYN: I have been

1121
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:03,107
making fire
for the last five years,

1122
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:05,109
practicing for this day.

1123
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:06,511
Am I good, though?

1124
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:08,913
I think I am.

1125
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:11,816
But out here,
I never wanted to, like,

1126
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,318
rattle the tribe and

1127
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,453
sneak off
and make fire and practice.

1128
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:17,988
So today, I have to.

1129
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,391
I don't know what Heidi thinks.

1130
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,327
I hope she picks herself.

1131
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,430
And then who?

1132
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,206
I won.

1133
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:38,743
Part of me wants
to be brought to the end,

1134
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,044
but part of me doesn't.

1135
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:42,347
And I want
to fight my way there.

1136
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:46,617
And it would be so wonderful
to have struggled at...

1137
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:49,887
...pretty much...

1138
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,457
...pretty much every challenge,

1139
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:54,725
and then to win one
would feel really great.

1140
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:59,263
Carson's the master
of feeding it. For sure.

1141
00:54:59,364 --> 00:55:01,899
You're the master
of the quick start.

1142
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,472
So is mine. (Sniffs)

1143
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,275
I'm on an incline, man.

1144
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:15,279
No, you're not.
You're in a perfect crevice.

1145
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,987
I feel comfortable making fire,
and so does Carolyn.

1146
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:26,223
But I saw Carson,
day one, doing the fire...

1147
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:28,693
He no good.

1148
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,968
When Carson and I
made fire, day one...

1149
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:39,770
Watch me fail really bad.
(laughs)

1150
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,772
You're trying it.
You're not failing.

1151
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,008
...I saw him
destroying that flint

1152
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:47,044
like it was a piece of meat.
I was like, "Dude,

1153
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:48,664
you don't go at it
like that, you know?

1154
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:51,416
You-you caress it with your,
with your steel."

1155
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:55,019
CARSON: Yeah.

1156
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,789
YAM YAM: I don't want to
see him fail in front of everyone.

1157
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:00,925
That's not what friends do.

1158
00:56:03,428 --> 00:56:04,862
CARSON: That's really good.

1159
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:06,597
You're gonna do it now.

1160
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:12,437
CARSON: Yam Yam
could very well be the person

1161
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:15,606
going against me in fire today.
And to know

1162
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,509
that his heart
is in the right place

1163
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:21,479
just really makes me
feel good, because

1164
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:24,449
I don't know if I would
do that for someone else.

1165
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:30,655
(crying)

1166
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,465
I struggle with
seeing people suffering.

1167
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:43,901
And seeing Carson do so well
in this game, and be so strong,

1168
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,937
and be so amazing
at everything he tackles

1169
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:49,507
and then seeing him
give up at the end,

1170
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:51,275
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

1171
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:55,145
I want Carson to go out
giving everything he has in him.

1172
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:59,149
And if it means that I need
to teach him my tricks,

1173
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,052
and he wins over me,

1174
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,988
is it a bad move?

1175
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:09,059
It's not important to me if
it's a bad move or a good move.

1176
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,896
It's something that I really,
honestly wanted to do.

1177
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:14,499
I don't know why
you're even helping me, but...

1178
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:17,134
I really,
I really appreciate it.

1179
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:20,304
I'm here for you, dude.
I'm here for you.

1180
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:23,508
We've been here for each other
since day three.

1181
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:25,976
There's no reason
why that needs to stop.

1182
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:27,277
(laughs)

1183
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,714
May the best Tika win.

1184
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:34,018
CARSON: Just the fact that
he would help me in a situation

1185
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:36,420
where it would be
an easy win against me,

1186
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:40,591
it's pretty amazing
and really speaks to,

1187
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:43,260
I think, how this game

1188
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,029
goes beyond just the money.

1189
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,568
Do you want us
to watch the other way, Heidi?

1190
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:53,303
I'm making the decision,
so it doesn't matter.

1191
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,906
This game is about risks,
but you

1192
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:57,575
got to take calculated risks.

1193
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:59,777
I feel comfortable
with my own skills.

1194
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:01,779
Fire.

1195
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:04,682
But someone else could be just
a little bit faster than me.

1196
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:06,350
That's amazing.

1197
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:10,020
HEIDI:
I've seen Yam Yam making fire.

1198
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,756
He looks solid.

1199
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:16,226
Carolyn also says she's decent.
I feel like

1200
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,786
Carson is the only one that
is a little bit of

1201
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,565
I have no idea
if he's good or not.

1202
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:23,167
He's an Eagle Scout, though,
so he knows, probably,

1203
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:25,302
a lot about fire,
compared to everyone else.

1204
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:27,437
So I'm weighing everything.

1205
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,075
If I win the fire,
I think I have the best case

1206
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:33,010
to win
the whole million dollars,

1207
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,012
but I have
to win the fire first.

1208
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:37,815
So this is a big decision.
My husband and I

1209
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:39,141
usually have
these conversations,

1210
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:40,618
"What would you do?"

1211
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:42,745
And I wish I could just
get some inspiration from him.

1212
00:58:42,787 --> 00:58:44,722
Would he tell me to do it

1213
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:46,691
or would he tell me
to not be silly?

1214
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:49,093
I want to go
with my own gut here,

1215
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,494
and I just have to live with it.

1216
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:53,764
It may be the million-dollar
decision where I win it

1217
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,433
or it may be the million-dollar
decision where I lose it,

1218
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:59,069
but I have to be comfortable
with the decision I make.

1219
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:01,639
Do I want
to take that risk or not?

1220
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:03,608
I don't know.

1221
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:16,253
♪ ♪

1222
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,347
All right.
Tonight, all of the power

1223
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:45,149
sits with you, Heidi.

1224
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:46,717
So let's review.

1225
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:48,853
We do our final
immunity challenge.

1226
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:51,021
It's Simmotion, a classic.

1227
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:53,357
Survivor final four challenge

1228
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:54,925
that anyone can win.

1229
00:59:55,025 --> 00:59:56,560
It came down to you and Carson.

1230
00:59:56,661 --> 01:00:00,264
You won your first
individual immunity win.

1231
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:01,999
You have a spot
at the final three.

1232
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,002
You also get to decide
who you force to make fire.

1233
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,806
But at the end of the challenge,
you said, "I'm going to consider"

1234
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:11,642
"a risky idea
and give up my spot,

1235
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:15,012
and actually go make fire
against somebody else."

1236
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,552
So now that
you've had all afternoon,

1237
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:18,548
let's just start there.

1238
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:20,217
Did you contemplate
that more today?

1239
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:21,551
A hundred percent.

1240
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:24,221
I mean, when we got to camp,

1241
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:27,057
after the challenge,
we started practicing.

1242
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:30,160
And up until now,
I'm, like, still like,

1243
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,797
"What's gonna happen?
Am I gonna do it or not?"

1244
01:00:32,897 --> 01:00:35,866
- I-I'm still wondering my options here.
- Right now?

1245
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,034
Yes.

1246
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,836
- Is that true?
- HEIDI: It's true.

1247
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:41,071
I haven't told anybody
what I'm doing.

1248
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:42,773
- Wow.
- HEIDI: Um, so it's gonna be

1249
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:44,809
new news for everyone,
including myself.

1250
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:49,747
- All right, let's talk about the pitch everybody made.
- Yeah.

1251
01:00:49,847 --> 01:00:52,382
Yam Yam, you talked
to Heidi, I'm guessing.

1252
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,617
What was your pitch?

1253
01:00:53,718 --> 01:00:56,253
(clicks tongue, exhales)

1254
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:58,488
It's complicated,
you know, because...

1255
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,759
...I like making fire.
I'm a pyro.

1256
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,527
I like flames,
I like striking it,

1257
01:01:03,728 --> 01:01:06,230
but I also want to be safe.

1258
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,133
So we talked about
the possibility of

1259
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:12,469
the success that might
bring to any of us.

1260
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:15,740
That's something
that is undeniable,

1261
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,600
and it's something
that the jury is watching.

1262
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:20,745
PROBST: So, Carolyn, what
was your pitch? Yam Yam says,

1263
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:23,647
"Hey, man, I'm good with fire
if you want, put me over there."

1264
01:01:23,748 --> 01:01:26,751
CAROLYN: Heidi, at one
point, said, "Anybody who wants

1265
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:29,920
"to volunteer and maybe
make this a little bit easier,

1266
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,222
and just say, 'Hey,
I'm interested in doing fire.'"

1267
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:34,892
I feel like a lot of people
were coming forward

1268
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:37,027
wanting to possibly do fire

1269
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:39,596
because of
how it may look in the end.

1270
01:01:39,764 --> 01:01:42,399
And I believe
we all felt pretty confident.

1271
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,770
Carson, how about you?

1272
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,973
Mm, I don't know
how comfortable I am

1273
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:51,475
with making fire, and,
um, that's me being honest.

1274
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,944
I made it, and I can do it,

1275
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,946
but I think it starts
getting in your head,

1276
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,682
and then all the pressure, like,
kind of starts piling on.

1277
01:01:58,783 --> 01:02:02,586
But I think for me, my pitch
really revolved around the idea

1278
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:05,589
that it might
make more sense for her to,

1279
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:07,792
you know, put herself
in the position

1280
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:11,428
to go against someone
who has been in control.

1281
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:15,632
So if I were in her position
and, like, had played her game,

1282
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,202
I would put myself up there.

1283
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:20,871
I know making the fire
and winning this...

1284
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:24,441
It's another bucket list item
for your résumé.

1285
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,543
I don't want second,
third or fourth.

1286
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:28,879
I want one.
I want first, Sole Survivor.

1287
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:30,380
It is a big decision.

1288
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,716
Am I nervous?
Yes, I'm very nervous.

1289
01:02:32,817 --> 01:02:34,718
PROBST: Are you ready
to make the decision?

1290
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:36,320
- I'm ready.
- PROBST: All right.

1291
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,389
Who are you going to put
in that number two position

1292
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,491
that's going to be
in the final three tomorrow?

1293
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,593
They will get a chance
to plead their case

1294
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,329
and they
will not be making fire.

1295
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:48,465
I am going to put there...

1296
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:53,603
...Ms. Carolyn,
and I hope she enjoys it.

1297
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:57,574
PROBST: Carolyn, how does
that feel? You have made it

1298
01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:59,243
to the final three.
There is nowhere

1299
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:00,845
else to go. Now it becomes

1300
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:03,147
- about pitching your case.
- CAROLYN: I know, I know.

1301
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:05,415
I-I don't have words right now.

1302
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:11,055
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1303
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:12,514
- PROBST: Don't be sorry.
- I don't have words,

1304
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:15,359
'cause I-I didn't expect this.
Me, especially.

1305
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,361
I'm, like, that kid who, like,

1306
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,864
couldn't shut up
in fifth grade, who...

1307
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:22,499
(sniffles) was separated
from the rest of the class

1308
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,134
because I was
so weird and different.

1309
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:26,236
And people just said,
like, "Just stop talking.

1310
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:27,737
Why can't you just be normal?"

1311
01:03:27,872 --> 01:03:32,342
And just to be here at the end,
it-it feels amazing.

1312
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:35,045
What do you say to the little
girl who was called weird?

1313
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,314
(laughs)

1314
01:03:38,883 --> 01:03:41,185
That it's okay to be you.

1315
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:44,154
Because that was my goal
when I came into this.

1316
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:46,323
That's all I wanted to do.

1317
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:48,692
And to think that
I'm here without trying

1318
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:52,562
to hide myself
or be a different person,

1319
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,165
it's like I don't need to hide,
in real life or here.

1320
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:57,401
It's too much, like...

1321
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,703
No, it's not too much.
It's perfect.

1322
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:01,906
You just learned a huge lesson,
which is you are okay

1323
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:03,908
- exactly as you are.
- (laughs)

1324
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:07,344
All right, Heidi, you decide
what you want to tell us next.

1325
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,747
So, I'll say one of the people
who will make fire.

1326
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:13,922
The first person
I'll put there will be Carson.

1327
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,088
PROBST: Earlier, Carson,
you said the pressure mounts.

1328
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,623
Is the pressure real?

1329
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:21,825
Yeah, it's pretty scary.

1330
01:04:21,926 --> 01:04:25,695
I mean, I'm-I'm going to do my
best, and that's all I can do.

1331
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,064
That's gonna be the test,

1332
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:29,199
is whether
I can pull through myself.

1333
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:32,002
It doesn't depend on anybody
else here. It depends on me.

1334
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:35,572
And that's where the pressure
is really hitting. (Chuckles)

1335
01:04:35,672 --> 01:04:38,142
All right, so, Heidi,
we have one person

1336
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:39,609
making fire is Carson.

1337
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,011
The big question is

1338
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:43,613
are you gonna take Carson on
in a showdown

1339
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,183
or are you gonna
take what you earned

1340
01:04:46,283 --> 01:04:48,118
and keep your spot
in the final three

1341
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,954
and put Yam Yam against Carson?

1342
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:52,822
Who's gonna take
the other spot in fire?

1343
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,559
So I've been thinking about this

1344
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,794
ever since you put this on me.

1345
01:04:58,963 --> 01:05:00,830
And the reason
I put Carson there

1346
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:02,666
is 'cause he's
a great player, right?

1347
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:05,970
So I am going to do fire
with Carson.

1348
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:06,971
Wow.

1349
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:08,572
Damn.

1350
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:10,174
HEIDI: I'm taking a chance.

1351
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:12,977
I don't want two, three or four.

1352
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:14,378
I want one.

1353
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:16,446
And I think I will
have an easier time convincing

1354
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:19,316
everyone to vote for me
if I can beat Carson

1355
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,318
- making the fire.
- PROBST: I got to say,

1356
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:22,738
if I'm at home
watching right now,

1357
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:25,990
I'm like,
"Give me a big bowl of popcorn."

1358
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:28,692
- My family's gonna lose it that I'm doing this.
- (laughing)

1359
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:32,596
Yam Yam, how does that feel?

1360
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:34,798
You have made it
to the final three.

1361
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:38,102
Five minutes ago,
I couldn't believe Carolyn

1362
01:05:38,202 --> 01:05:42,039
was speechless, 'cause this is
not something that Carolyn does.

1363
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:44,441
And I feel
the same freaking way.

1364
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,244
Like, to be
100% honest with you,

1365
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:50,580
I never imagined, ever,

1366
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,806
that I would be in a position

1367
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:54,384
to talk to the jury.

1368
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:56,286
And I freaking love it.

1369
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:57,887
(laughs)

1370
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:00,190
So, Heidi,
you and Carson are gonna

1371
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,359
take part
in a fire-making showdown.

1372
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:06,030
The winner will be
the third and final person

1373
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:07,497
in our final three.

1374
01:06:07,597 --> 01:06:10,367
All right, take your spots.

1375
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,903
It's up to you which one
you pick. They're identical.

1376
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:15,039
Good luck, Heidi.

1377
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:17,174
No, no, no.

1378
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:19,109
Good luck, guys. You're amazing.

1379
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:21,145
Aah!
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1380
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:23,613
PROBST: All right, I'm
gonna give you two a moment

1381
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,715
to take everything in,
get acquainted

1382
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,452
with your supplies,
and then we will start

1383
01:06:28,552 --> 01:06:32,322
what might be a million-dollar
fire-making challenge.

1384
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:43,967
All right. Big decision
made by Heidi to take on

1385
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:46,570
Carson in
a fire-making challenge.

1386
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,739
It's not an exaggeration to say.

1387
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,976
You both have the same supplies.
You know the rules.

1388
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:57,081
Build a fire big enough
to burn through that rope.

1389
01:06:57,114 --> 01:06:59,716
The person
who does that will sit

1390
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:02,952
in that stool tomorrow night
at the final three.

1391
01:07:03,087 --> 01:07:04,354
Are you both ready?

1392
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,392
This challenge is on. Go.

1393
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:12,096
CAROLYN: Oh, my gosh.

1394
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:14,098
PROBST: You need heat.

1395
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:15,599
You get that from the friction

1396
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:19,269
of striking that flint,
creating that spark.

1397
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,106
Then you need fuel,
which is what you're burning.

1398
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:26,143
You're both going with hessian,
and then you need oxygen.

1399
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:28,745
You got to build that fire
so it breathes.

1400
01:07:30,114 --> 01:07:31,648
Heidi quickly going to it.

1401
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:33,350
Getting a spark.

1402
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,485
Trying to get a flame.

1403
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:38,155
There's a little flame.

1404
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:41,758
Can she breathe
some life into it? She has.

1405
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:45,395
Now you got to make
that a fire that'll last,

1406
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:49,166
because that hessian burns
quickly, and it will burn out.

1407
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:52,035
There goes Carson now,
trying to get a little spark.

1408
01:07:52,136 --> 01:07:53,537
And he's got it.
Can he get a flame?

1409
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,005
Got to get something to burn.

1410
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:01,044
Heidi doing a nice job
of nurturing her first flame.

1411
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,450
Carson scraping more magnesium.

1412
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,830
- Strike it.
- Strike it. Strike.

1413
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:15,058
PROBST: Heidi doing a
nice job, slowly building.

1414
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:16,926
Carson now has a flame.

1415
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,296
He's got to get that
to take without smothering it.

1416
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,997
Heidi doing a really nice job.

1417
01:08:21,165 --> 01:08:23,357
- That flame is starting to grow.
- YAM YAM: That's amazing.

1418
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,670
PROBST: She's using kindling,
one or two pieces at a time.

1419
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,372
Now Carson trying to get
a couple of pieces of kindling.

1420
01:08:32,576 --> 01:08:34,278
Go crazy.

1421
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:35,944
PROBST:
Heidi doing a really nice job

1422
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,247
of slowly nurturing that fire

1423
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:41,084
while letting it breathe,
which is essential.

1424
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:46,490
Heidi's building an inferno.
That is a real fire.

1425
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:48,992
Carson's now got a flame going.

1426
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,552
- He's putting some kindling.
- YAM YAM: You're both in it.

1427
01:08:50,594 --> 01:08:51,961
You're both...

1428
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,298
Carson's now in it.
We've got two fires going.

1429
01:08:54,398 --> 01:08:55,399
Don't quit.

1430
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,526
- Believe in yourself.
- PROBST: Both players now working quickly

1431
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:00,737
to get more kindling in there.

1432
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:04,874
Carson's flame is starting
to grow, but he's got

1433
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,701
- to get more height quickly.
- CAROLYN: Hurry up.

1434
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:08,745
PROBST: Heidi's flame
is all over that rope,

1435
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:10,314
- and it's over.
- Yes!

1436
01:09:10,413 --> 01:09:11,747
- (laughing)
- Oh, my God.

1437
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:13,617
PROBST: Heidi has done it.

1438
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:17,487
One of the fastest fires
we've ever had.

1439
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:24,228
Heidi has taken
the spot in the final three.

1440
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:28,149
- I'm sorry, Carson. I love you. I love you, sweetie.
- No, no. No, Heidi.

1441
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,728
- I-I would have done the same thing if I were you. Yeah.
- I love you.

1442
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,241
- Carson, I got to say, your fire was lasting.
- Yeah.

1443
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:40,042
You were just a little late,
but you built a decent fire.

1444
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:42,946
- Yeah.
- PROBST: Nothing to be ashamed of with that fire.

1445
01:09:43,046 --> 01:09:46,550
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Heidi was on fire with her fire.

1446
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:47,984
I can't believe I just did that.

1447
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:50,720
PROBST: Heidi, that is

1448
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:54,258
- the fastest fire ever made...
- (squeals)

1449
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:57,261
- Oh, my God.
- ...on Survivor.

1450
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:59,396
Oh, my God. That's awesome.

1451
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:01,398
YAM YAM: Good job. That's great.

1452
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:02,632
LAUREN: That's crazy.

1453
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,033
(laughing)

1454
01:10:04,268 --> 01:10:05,669
That is remarkable.

1455
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:08,472
- You put your money where your mouth is.
- Yes.

1456
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:09,973
You said, "I came to win."

1457
01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:12,409
So you put yourself,
literally, in the hot seat,

1458
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:14,077
and you pulled it off.

1459
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:17,414
- That, in and of itself, is a massive victory.
- ...legend.

1460
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:20,417
But I was so scared
because this is a risk.

1461
01:10:20,517 --> 01:10:23,086
Like, you never know if it's
actually gonna work here.

1462
01:10:23,186 --> 01:10:27,724
And doing it
feels absolutely amazing.

1463
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:31,795
- Oh, my God.
- Oh. It... I-I have no words. This moment is ridiculous.

1464
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:35,599
- PROBST: All right, Carson, let's talk.
- Yeah.

1465
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:37,767
25 days, and you came

1466
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:40,236
this close to getting
to the final three.

1467
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:41,738
Yeah.

1468
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:43,231
- PROBST: It's a massive achievement.
- Thank you.

1469
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:45,208
And I hope
you have impressed yourself.

1470
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:47,577
Yeah. I mean,

1471
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:50,480
I think everyone here
can attest to my day today.

1472
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,649
I was in tears.

1473
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,017
- PROBST: Aw.
- I was...

1474
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:57,086
- Aw. I'm sorry.
- Like, I, like, let it out,

1475
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,756
because I wasn't
confident in myself.

1476
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:02,559
And, so, for me

1477
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:05,862
to start fire
and at least have something

1478
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:09,966
going against the fastest
fire-making winner ever,

1479
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:12,336
I'm so proud of myself

1480
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:14,604
for challenging myself,

1481
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:16,840
becoming more self-confident,

1482
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:19,709
and that is what
I'm leaving here today.

1483
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:23,012
All right, Carson,
it is time to grab your torch.

1484
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,147
Okay.

1485
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,487
- So proud. You're amazing.
- Thank y'all.

1486
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,557
- Love you.
- CARSON: Love y'all, too.

1487
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,461
Carson, the tribe has spoken.

1488
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:40,364
I didn't think I'd be smiling.

1489
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,965
- (laughing)
- This is awesome.

1490
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:43,933
- You should be smiling. Good job.
- Thank you.

1491
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,168
Good luck, y'all.

1492
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:46,936
- Y'all are amazing.
- You are, too.

1493
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,872
Uh, I can't wait to hear it all.

1494
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:50,173
G-Give it your all tomorrow.

1495
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:58,915
All right.

1496
01:11:59,015 --> 01:12:01,718
You have made it
to the final three.

1497
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,520
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1498
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:06,390
PROBST:
Tomorrow night, the game shifts.

1499
01:12:06,423 --> 01:12:08,825
All the power...
Boom, right there.

1500
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:10,927
People you
had a hand in voting out.

1501
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:14,464
They will decide
who wins Survivor 44.

1502
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:16,666
You have one more night
in beautiful Fiji.

1503
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:19,569
I know it's gonna
be hard to sleep, but try,

1504
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,871
'cause you want to be
clearheaded tomorrow

1505
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:23,306
when you make your case.

1506
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:25,132
Grab your torches,
head back to camp. Good night.

1507
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,443
Thank you.

1508
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:27,835
- Great job, Heidi.
- CAROLYN: Good job, Heidi.

1509
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:29,913
Oh, my gosh.

1510
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:33,917
(laughing)

1511
01:12:35,619 --> 01:12:37,554
You all are nuts.

1512
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:40,957
CARSON: To lose against someone

1513
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:42,992
who made the fastest Survivor

1514
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,228
fire-making challenge in history

1515
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,497
feels pretty awesome.

1516
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:49,317
Even though I didn't
get to the final three,

1517
01:12:49,433 --> 01:12:52,769
I'm so proud of myself,
and it's incredible

1518
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,704
to be on Survivor and actually

1519
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:57,173
live my dream of playing, so

1520
01:12:57,273 --> 01:12:59,743
I'm still kind of pinching
myself that I'm even here.

1521
01:13:07,651 --> 01:13:09,686
♪ ♪

1522
01:13:11,455 --> 01:13:16,292
YAM YAM: The final three. 44.

1523
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,194
Just a few more hours.

1524
01:13:18,294 --> 01:13:20,497
Girl, I'm gonna cry.

1525
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:21,865
I'm so freaking scared.

1526
01:13:21,965 --> 01:13:23,467
You think?

1527
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:26,803
That's how I feel.

1528
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,539
Like, I feel like it's finals,
and I'm gonna, like...

1529
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:30,674
Yup.

1530
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:34,978
I don't want to sound stupid.

1531
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,746
- I... Trust me.
- HEIDI: You won't.

1532
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:38,305
- We've all seen...
- You're gonna sound

1533
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:39,974
- more stupid than me?
- CAROLYN: Probably.

1534
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:41,485
Okay. Thank you.

1535
01:13:41,518 --> 01:13:42,910
Making it to the final three
on Survivor,

1536
01:13:42,952 --> 01:13:44,521
it's freaking awesome.

1537
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:45,847
Not everybody
gets to the final three.

1538
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:47,214
You know how many
get to the final three?

1539
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,725
Only three. And I'm one of them.

1540
01:13:48,825 --> 01:13:51,961
Now the only thing
I need to do is win the game.

1541
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:53,229
But the biggest hurdle

1542
01:13:53,329 --> 01:13:55,398
is tonight. Am I gonna be able

1543
01:13:55,499 --> 01:13:57,501
to convince the jury
to vote for me to win?

1544
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:03,072
I decided how I wanted
to get here, and I got here.

1545
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:04,974
But it doesn't matter
what I did,

1546
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:06,710
because it's all
perception here.

1547
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,211
It doesn't matter
the way I see it,

1548
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:09,613
because I'm not the one voting.

1549
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:11,981
Now I need to make
the jury members believe

1550
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:14,417
I played a million-dollar game.

1551
01:14:14,518 --> 01:14:15,852
My words are my weapons.

1552
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,521
I'm gonna
use them to my advantage.

1553
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:20,123
KANE: Yam Yam is a
very perceptive player.

1554
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:22,358
The guy can read
body language from a mile away.

1555
01:14:22,526 --> 01:14:24,686
Like, if you fart at the
water well, he knows about it.

1556
01:14:24,728 --> 01:14:27,396
He made himself
a part of everybody's plan,

1557
01:14:27,531 --> 01:14:30,800
to the point where I could
not get him off the beach.

1558
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,302
MATT:
Yam Yam played the middleman.

1559
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:35,939
He had relationships
with most people,

1560
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:38,608
and he was able to sort of,
like, straddle this line

1561
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:42,211
brilliantly, in a way
that no one felt betrayed,

1562
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,547
but benefited his game.

1563
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:45,615
BRANDON: Yam Yam
is absolutely hilarious,

1564
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:47,450
and he understands
his game to a T.

1565
01:14:47,551 --> 01:14:50,353
Every move that he made
along the way was intentional.

1566
01:14:50,453 --> 01:14:52,622
It was all deliberate.
He put himself in the position

1567
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:55,424
where he had the option
to decide what he wanted to do,

1568
01:14:55,559 --> 01:14:56,993
and he took advantage of it.

1569
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,664
- HEIDI: Let's go!
- CAROLYN: Oh.

1570
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:05,635
YAM YAM: No way.

1571
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:07,170
Don't drop it.

1572
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:08,805
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

1573
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:10,707
Oh, there's a griddle.

1574
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:12,275
(squeals)

1575
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:14,343
HEIDI: I think the jury
has seen my game.

1576
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,145
This was not
an easy ride for me.

1577
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:18,582
I fought every single day
to make it here.

1578
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:20,917
I had to do whatever I could

1579
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,687
to survive, and I took risks.

1580
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:26,155
I think making the fire
really boosts my résumé.

1581
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,015
- This is our dream.
- Final three breakfast.

1582
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:29,926
- Yes. It's our dream.
- (whoops)

1583
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,595
Salud.

1584
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:33,429
I'm proud of my journey.

1585
01:15:33,597 --> 01:15:35,198
I'm proud
to make it to final three.

1586
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:38,668
I'm gonna put my heart out there
for the jury to vote for me.

1587
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:41,104
CARSON: Heidi killed it.

1588
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:44,407
She put herself in a vulnerable
position to take me out.

1589
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:47,010
Fastest fire-making ever
in Survivor.

1590
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:49,746
For her to pull through
to the very end gives me

1591
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:51,005
more of a reason
for me to vote for her.

1592
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:53,082
Heidi made
a huge move last night.

1593
01:15:53,182 --> 01:15:54,618
Carson was the king.

1594
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:56,410
You take a shot at the king,
you best not miss.

1595
01:15:56,452 --> 01:15:57,353
And Heidi didn't miss,

1596
01:15:57,453 --> 01:15:58,622
so that makes her the queen.

1597
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:00,256
JAIME: Heidi never gives up.

1598
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:02,325
She is such a strong woman.

1599
01:16:02,425 --> 01:16:04,093
If she can articulate

1600
01:16:04,193 --> 01:16:08,031
how she ensured her safety
every single time,

1601
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:09,432
she's gonna get my vote.

1602
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:11,868
Are you worried?

1603
01:16:11,968 --> 01:16:14,237
Of course I'm worried.
I'm nervous.

1604
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:16,305
I'm scared
of getting tripped up,

1605
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,265
not thinking I'm good enough,
not thinking I'm, like, worthy.

1606
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:21,210
All that type of stupid,
like, self-loathing

1607
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,412
is gonna be my, like, downfall.

1608
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:26,816
Kind of like how you get

1609
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:29,018
when you're
talking emotions sometimes.

1610
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:35,659
Remember day one,
when you interviewed me?

1611
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:37,060
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I do.

1612
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,496
We're here on day 26.
This is full success.

1613
01:16:40,664 --> 01:16:42,056
Did you think
you'd make it this far?

1614
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:43,566
No, not a chance.

1615
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:45,969
I didn't even think
I'd make merge.

1616
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:50,740
Did I think that
my personality would get me...

1617
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:54,678
Uh, no, I didn't,
but it feels amazing.

1618
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:57,280
Coming here was the dream.
Finding an idol was the dream.

1619
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:00,516
All the crazy blindsides
I made happen,

1620
01:17:00,684 --> 01:17:03,219
I might as well just win.
I'm ready.

1621
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:05,689
So now
I have to convince the jury

1622
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:09,025
being emotional
was part of my strategy,

1623
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,695
and that
it can be taken seriously,

1624
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:13,462
and that being emotional

1625
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:15,531
can be respected in this game.

1626
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:18,401
FRANNIE: I believe that you can
be an incredibly intelligent,

1627
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:23,139
strategic player and a player
who plays with a lot of emotion.

1628
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,308
That is what Carolyn did.

1629
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:28,611
She used her emotions
as an advantage.

1630
01:17:28,712 --> 01:17:30,714
LAUREN:
Carolyn was such a great player,

1631
01:17:30,747 --> 01:17:33,149
authentically, as herself.

1632
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:36,853
Who has played like that before?
I don't know... Carolyn.

1633
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:40,323
If she's self-aware of that,

1634
01:17:40,423 --> 01:17:41,749
she'll definitely
get my vote tonight.

1635
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:43,059
JAIME: Carolyn was

1636
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:46,095
all over the place
in the most masterful way.

1637
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:48,965
She let us believe
that she didn't know

1638
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:51,735
what she was doing,
when she knew what she was doing

1639
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:53,636
every single conversation.

1640
01:17:53,737 --> 01:17:55,171
And that's brilliant gameplay.

1641
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:10,319
FRANNIE: Everything

1642
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:12,255
is riding on this final Tribal.

1643
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:15,792
I don't want anybody to sit back
and feel like their game

1644
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:17,626
has spoken for itself,
because it hasn't.

1645
01:18:17,761 --> 01:18:20,129
YAM YAM:
It is the moment of truth.

1646
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,565
MATT: Season 44 was

1647
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:24,433
an absolute banger season.

1648
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,235
So my vote is going

1649
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:29,305
to the person
who saw opportunities

1650
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:31,007
and smashed them
out of the park.

1651
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:33,242
BRANDON: I want to see
fireworks. I want to see people

1652
01:18:33,342 --> 01:18:34,601
who are hungry for that million.

1653
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,145
LAUREN:
I want them to be confident

1654
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:38,581
in their individual game

1655
01:18:38,681 --> 01:18:41,350
that doesn't rely
on anyone else.

1656
01:18:45,789 --> 01:18:48,157
JAIME: I am hoping the gloves
come off and we get to see

1657
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:49,793
everyone's true colors.

1658
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:52,561
DANNY: This is gonna
be Tyson vs. Holyfield.

1659
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:53,921
There's no way
you can predict this.

1660
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:56,699
CARSON: My vote is on the table.

1661
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,101
You've got to grab it.

1662
01:18:58,201 --> 01:18:59,402
KANE: I want to see sword

1663
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:01,037
and shield tonight.
This is a fight

1664
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:02,605
for a million dollars,

1665
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:04,941
and I'm ready to watch
the fight of my life.

1666
01:19:06,142 --> 01:19:08,677
All right, here we are.

1667
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:11,447
Heidi, Yam Yam, Carolyn.

1668
01:19:11,547 --> 01:19:14,217
26 days gets you here,

1669
01:19:14,317 --> 01:19:16,385
and now the power

1670
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,521
shifts to the jury.

1671
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:21,624
Eight people
that you played alongside

1672
01:19:21,724 --> 01:19:24,560
will be casting a vote tonight,
and it's gonna be for the person

1673
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:28,832
they think is most deserving
of the title of Sole Survivor

1674
01:19:28,898 --> 01:19:30,867
and the million dollars
that goes along with it.

1675
01:19:30,967 --> 01:19:33,736
Your job is to convince them

1676
01:19:33,837 --> 01:19:36,105
it's you that deserves
that title and the check.

1677
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:38,274
What did you do
better than the other two?

1678
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:42,311
You have to step up
and claim your game

1679
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:44,113
in order to claim your victory.

1680
01:19:44,213 --> 01:19:46,249
If you don't,
you'll get left in the dust.

1681
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:49,185
Jury, your job:
Hold them accountable.

1682
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,287
Make them defend their case.

1683
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:52,989
What is it they did
that is better

1684
01:19:53,089 --> 01:19:55,049
than the other two people
that they're sitting with?

1685
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:57,260
That's who
deserves to win this game.

1686
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,929
Heidi, Yam Yam, Carolyn,
I'm gonna give you a minute

1687
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:03,366
to prepare for their questions,
and then we'll go.

1688
01:20:18,014 --> 01:20:19,615
All right, it is time to get

1689
01:20:19,715 --> 01:20:26,422
to the final Tribal Council
of Survivor 44.

1690
01:20:26,522 --> 01:20:29,625
Social, physical, strategy.

1691
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:31,794
It's fine if we overlap.

1692
01:20:31,895 --> 01:20:33,362
Kane, get us started.

1693
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:36,165
- (whoops) (chuckles) Let's go.
- (laughter)

1694
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:38,234
Uh, first off,
I want you guys to know

1695
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,903
that we are
all very proud of you.

1696
01:20:40,003 --> 01:20:42,138
I think
every single person here,

1697
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:43,539
their vote is up in the air.

1698
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:45,808
So for me to vote for you,

1699
01:20:45,909 --> 01:20:48,477
you need
to explain your game to me,

1700
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:51,347
and then you need to
convince me that it is better,

1701
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,849
unapologetically,
than the other two people.

1702
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:57,253
So my first question to you
is what do you think

1703
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:01,190
our perception of you is
and do you think it's accurate?

1704
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,892
- Yam Yam.
- YAM YAM: What do I think

1705
01:21:02,992 --> 01:21:04,327
it is your perception of me?

1706
01:21:04,427 --> 01:21:06,329
I think you love me, of course.

1707
01:21:06,429 --> 01:21:07,563
(laughing)

1708
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:09,465
I believe that
all of you perceive me

1709
01:21:09,565 --> 01:21:12,168
as a happy-go-lucky person,
which I am.

1710
01:21:12,268 --> 01:21:14,103
I believe all of you
perceive me as someone

1711
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:17,073
that loves this game and love to
make moves, which is also true.

1712
01:21:17,173 --> 01:21:19,108
What I think
the biggest perception of me,

1713
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,177
which I think
is the wrong perception,

1714
01:21:21,277 --> 01:21:23,779
is that I was following
Carson's steps all the way.

1715
01:21:23,947 --> 01:21:27,150
Carson and I did an alliance
day three with Carolyn,

1716
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,452
and the perception was,
like, we were a disaster.

1717
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:32,321
But we know
what was the target every time.

1718
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:34,581
- Carolyn also had...
- Can I say something within that?

1719
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:36,859
Towards the beginning
of the merge,

1720
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,395
you guys were kind of riding
a little bit of...

1721
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:41,655
- It wasn't like that.
- The wave of the, of the Soka members.

1722
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:44,017
It wasn't like that. That's what
we wanted you to perceive.

1723
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:45,969
We wanted you to perceive
that we were willing

1724
01:21:46,035 --> 01:21:47,803
to go with the target
that you chose.

1725
01:21:47,971 --> 01:21:49,005
Oh.

1726
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:51,107
So I knew
every single people's vote,

1727
01:21:51,207 --> 01:21:52,841
every time we go to Tribal.

1728
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,344
Heidi.

1729
01:21:55,444 --> 01:21:58,014
So, how do I think
you perceive me? Right?

1730
01:21:58,114 --> 01:22:01,150
I think it probably varies
throughout the entire game.

1731
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,819
When we started the merge,
I think the perception

1732
01:22:03,987 --> 01:22:07,356
was that I was
very much into the strategy.

1733
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:09,892
Then when I got
into the hole that I lost

1734
01:22:09,993 --> 01:22:12,528
some of my Soka numbers,
it probably was like,

1735
01:22:12,628 --> 01:22:14,998
"Well, Heidi's
no longer strategic.

1736
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:16,223
"She's just
riding everyone's tail

1737
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,167
because she has to survive."

1738
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:21,837
But within that hole,
I really was trying my best

1739
01:22:22,005 --> 01:22:23,172
to still be strategic.

1740
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,441
I tried to really
integrate a little bit

1741
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:28,011
of my social game
to get to where I was.

1742
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:30,146
And at the very end,
which happened yesterday,

1743
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:32,481
I used everything I could
to put myself

1744
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:35,784
in the best position, so I could
have a good speech to give you.

1745
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:37,086
- Okay, Carolyn.
- Carolyn.

1746
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:39,455
So right away, I didn't fit in.

1747
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:41,557
I was a little quirky
and different, and...

1748
01:22:41,657 --> 01:22:43,192
and then I found Carson.

1749
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:46,195
And we connected
over genuine realness

1750
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:49,365
and him saying, you know,
"I was that quirky kid,"

1751
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:50,599
and that was day one.

1752
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:52,601
And then I found you,
and I said,

1753
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:54,470
"How in the heck
did he get on my tribe?"

1754
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:58,941
(laughing) - Because we are
so similar, and he is so much,

1755
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:01,177
- and I am so much, too.
- Girl.

1756
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:04,313
But as far as perceptions go,
I know that I was

1757
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:07,750
looked at as, like,
"Girl, like, who is this?"

1758
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:11,254
And I was underestimated
this entire game.

1759
01:23:11,354 --> 01:23:12,855
I was playing,

1760
01:23:12,955 --> 01:23:16,292
but I was so underestimated
that sometimes

1761
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:18,392
it kind of played into itself,
if that makes sense.

1762
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:21,430
CARSON: And I just want to
give you and Yam Yam props.

1763
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:24,633
You were able to evolve yourself
and make those relationships,

1764
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,902
and that's what I'm impressed
with both of you about.

1765
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:29,072
And, Heidi, I didn't
get to really know your game,

1766
01:23:29,172 --> 01:23:30,564
'cause I didn't
play with you as long,

1767
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:32,508
but I'd love
to hear your own gameplay

1768
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:34,543
and your own social
relationships you built, too.

1769
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:38,081
Yeah, so we had four Soka
members going into the merge,

1770
01:23:38,181 --> 01:23:42,285
but the players that I was with,
we all got targets right away

1771
01:23:42,385 --> 01:23:44,220
'cause we were all
strong in some capacity.

1772
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,147
I mean, the difference
between their game and mine

1773
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:47,623
is they were on a high.

1774
01:23:47,723 --> 01:23:50,093
I suffered
through a heck of a lot,

1775
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,528
and that's
the reality of our games.

1776
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:53,862
Very different games.

1777
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:56,099
And we all, the three of us,
I'm proud to say,

1778
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:57,591
we made it here
in very different ways.

1779
01:23:57,633 --> 01:23:59,535
We were not always in a high,

1780
01:23:59,635 --> 01:24:01,437
and we took advantage
of not being in a high.

1781
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,872
We took advantage
of the perception

1782
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:05,308
that you were saving us,

1783
01:24:05,408 --> 01:24:06,809
and we were saving ourselves.

1784
01:24:06,909 --> 01:24:08,935
But you can see how
Carson is defending you because.

1785
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:11,738
- Carson was a lot of the brains behind that, though.
- YAM YAM: I was gonna get there.

1786
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,316
- I was gonna get there.
- Okay.

1787
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:15,276
DANNY: But with all due
respect, I'll tell you right now,

1788
01:24:15,318 --> 01:24:17,353
I played my game
compartmentalized, and I take

1789
01:24:17,453 --> 01:24:20,456
pride in that, and I have
so much respect for this game,

1790
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:22,383
if my mother was up there
and she had a bad pitch,

1791
01:24:22,425 --> 01:24:23,792
she's not getting my vote.

1792
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:27,696
So what I want to hear is
how did you guys use Carson?

1793
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:30,266
'Cause I'm sure
that nothing you guys did

1794
01:24:30,366 --> 01:24:32,501
was just going with it.

1795
01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:35,003
I used Carson
to get a lot of information,

1796
01:24:35,138 --> 01:24:36,618
but I did that
with a lot of you guys.

1797
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:40,643
It wasn't only with Carson,
and I got to eat...

1798
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:42,578
- (laughter)
- because Carson took me.

1799
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:44,371
And that was no mistake
on my part, you know?

1800
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:48,151
But it's not a thing like,
"I use Carson for this."

1801
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:51,019
I use everyone.
And that speaks to my game.

1802
01:24:51,154 --> 01:24:53,589
They should have been coming
for me, and they didn't.

1803
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:55,524
Well, your name was
written several times,

1804
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:57,518
and you said you had to survive the
first few Tribals, -It was, it was, it was.

1805
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,727
- So...
- That's right.

1806
01:24:58,827 --> 01:24:59,953
I thought that was
because I'm pretty.

1807
01:24:59,995 --> 01:25:01,897
(laughing)

1808
01:25:01,997 --> 01:25:03,866
DANNY: And, Heidi,
for you, who did you use

1809
01:25:03,966 --> 01:25:06,034
to propel your game,
as kind of, like, a shield

1810
01:25:06,169 --> 01:25:07,170
to move yourself forward?

1811
01:25:07,236 --> 01:25:08,195
Thank you for the question.

1812
01:25:08,237 --> 01:25:10,306
I think the answer, it's you,

1813
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:12,808
'cause I truly thought
we could work together,

1814
01:25:12,908 --> 01:25:14,843
and we did
for almost the entire game.

1815
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,913
And I knew you look
physically more fit than I do,

1816
01:25:18,013 --> 01:25:20,216
so I knew you will
have a bigger target than me.

1817
01:25:20,316 --> 01:25:22,285
So, did I use you as a shield?

1818
01:25:22,385 --> 01:25:25,554
100%. 100%, I did.
But that doesn't take away from

1819
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:27,648
the friendship that we created
throughout the game.

1820
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:30,058
Yeah, of course. But, yeah,
it makes sense. Perfect.

1821
01:25:30,193 --> 01:25:31,794
FRANNIE:
Um, I love all the strategy,

1822
01:25:31,894 --> 01:25:34,197
like, love the numbers, but
I feel like there's a lot more

1823
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:36,257
- to dig into with, like, social.
- Mm-hmm. - Right.

1824
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:38,967
- Yeah.
- So, one thing that we talk about and think about

1825
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:40,969
a lot in this game
is emotions, right?

1826
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:43,872
And on one end,
there is an emotional player,

1827
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,241
and on the other end, there is

1828
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:47,743
an intellectual,
strategic player.

1829
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:50,413
And you can use both
effectively in this game.

1830
01:25:50,513 --> 01:25:54,617
So I want to understand
from each of you how you managed

1831
01:25:54,717 --> 01:25:58,554
your emotions, how you saw them
as a strength or a weakness.

1832
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,556
And I would
love Carolyn to start,

1833
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:03,259
because you've been so open
about saying that you are

1834
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:05,694
an emotional person
and an emotional player.

1835
01:26:05,794 --> 01:26:07,530
I'm gonna get emotional.
(chuckles)

1836
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:09,898
- Good. Good.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

1837
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:15,238
When you're actively addicted,

1838
01:26:15,338 --> 01:26:16,905
you hold things in.

1839
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:20,243
I didn't express myself.

1840
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:22,778
I didn't know
how to express myself.

1841
01:26:22,878 --> 01:26:24,347
I didn't know
what emotions were.

1842
01:26:24,447 --> 01:26:26,249
I learned that all
going through treatment.

1843
01:26:26,282 --> 01:26:27,583
So there's that spectrum

1844
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,585
of you're either strategic
or you're emotional.

1845
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:31,754
You can't be both.
There is no in between.

1846
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:34,423
And honestly,
I just didn't want to do that,

1847
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:37,560
because, to me,
it was way too painful

1848
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,595
to go there and numb that.

1849
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:42,498
Yes, there were times
where I knew that

1850
01:26:42,598 --> 01:26:44,700
they're gonna expect me
to be emotional right now,

1851
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,169
because I cry
when I eat a papaya.

1852
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:48,504
We get rice, I'm crying.

1853
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:49,938
You give me a hug, I'm crying.

1854
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,341
I'm so grateful.
That was all real.

1855
01:26:52,441 --> 01:26:54,643
But I know
that there were moments

1856
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:56,745
where I needed
people to trust me.

1857
01:26:56,845 --> 01:27:00,683
I knew I needed to fake those
tears, and then compose myself.

1858
01:27:00,783 --> 01:27:02,885
It wasn't always easy for me.

1859
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:04,953
PROBST: Yam Yam.

1860
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,356
So, emotions,

1861
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:10,293
which I have,
I have many emotions.

1862
01:27:10,393 --> 01:27:13,729
My happiness, my love, my care,
how do I use this in my favor?

1863
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:15,121
And I don't want to,
like, offend anybody

1864
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:16,757
on the conversations
that I had were real,

1865
01:27:16,799 --> 01:27:20,603
but some of you were very
blank when I would talk to you.

1866
01:27:20,703 --> 01:27:23,005
Jaime, for example,
was super blank.

1867
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:24,707
Brandon was super blank to me.

1868
01:27:24,807 --> 01:27:26,975
- Kane is still like that, you know?
- (laughter)

1869
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,545
But how did I knew

1870
01:27:29,645 --> 01:27:31,947
if you guys were
telling me the truth or not?

1871
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:34,483
I would take my time
to build real relationship

1872
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:37,453
with each of you
and see how your eye twinkle

1873
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:40,088
when you're talking about
your loved one, or your eye

1874
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:42,825
twinkle when you're talking
about food or about your work.

1875
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:44,827
So when you guys
were lying to me

1876
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:46,687
or not telling me the truth,
that twinkle went away.

1877
01:27:46,729 --> 01:27:49,231
So I use your emotions
and your facial expressions

1878
01:27:49,332 --> 01:27:50,666
that I knew were real

1879
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,293
and compared them
to when they were not real.

1880
01:27:52,335 --> 01:27:54,603
And that's why I'm so
successful working with people.

1881
01:27:54,703 --> 01:27:57,239
I'm there working
with 25 crazies,

1882
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:00,208
so I'm, like, right at home
when I was next to her.

1883
01:28:00,343 --> 01:28:02,010
But in all the best way.

1884
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,580
And it was hard. It was scary.
I was like...

1885
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,550
(sharp inhale) "Can I do this
in English? Let's see."

1886
01:28:08,551 --> 01:28:10,986
But that's how
I use emotions in my favor...

1887
01:28:11,086 --> 01:28:12,688
Not only my emotions,

1888
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:15,223
but how I use your emotions
to know what was going on.

1889
01:28:15,358 --> 01:28:16,625
Amazing.

1890
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:18,661
PROBST: Heidi.

1891
01:28:18,761 --> 01:28:20,128
I'm glad
you asked that question,

1892
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:22,931
because I-I really
want to explain myself,

1893
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,267
and I'm gonna get
to the emotions with this,

1894
01:28:25,368 --> 01:28:29,372
but the why I'm in Survivor,
why I'm here is

1895
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:32,908
I want to represent people
that sound different,

1896
01:28:33,008 --> 01:28:34,109
that look different.

1897
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:38,381
I want to represent
girls out there that want

1898
01:28:38,447 --> 01:28:40,087
to be in science
and want to be different.

1899
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:44,086
Right? And with that comes
a whole lot of responsibilities.

1900
01:28:44,186 --> 01:28:47,956
Being Latina in science,
I work with all guys,

1901
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:49,758
so I have to keep my composure.

1902
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:52,094
And I have learned
to control my emotions

1903
01:28:52,194 --> 01:28:54,162
to be successful at what I do.

1904
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:57,500
So I feel like I have been
in the spectrum of emotions,

1905
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,167
but I have tried to control it,

1906
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:01,404
so I can still
represent the best way I can

1907
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:04,407
for the people that I want
to show that they can do this.

1908
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:06,467
LAUREN: And I want to say
thank you so much for sharing that.

1909
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:09,978
And I definitely saw
you controlling your emotions,

1910
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:12,748
and that made you continue on
throughout the game.

1911
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,475
- Thank you.
- LAUREN: You know, and you just

1912
01:29:14,517 --> 01:29:17,520
externalize it or internalize
it differently than the others.

1913
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:20,789
Um, I just want to, like,
slide one little thing in.

1914
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:23,329
This is less of a question than
it is just, like, a statement.

1915
01:29:23,426 --> 01:29:26,862
Um, something I admire
about all of you is you guys

1916
01:29:26,962 --> 01:29:30,198
did a really good job of being
yourselves out here. All of you.

1917
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:32,134
- Thank you.
- MATT: Big personalities.

1918
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:35,804
You shared with all of us,
and that's really hard for me.

1919
01:29:35,904 --> 01:29:38,641
And I'm, like, so happy
that you get this platform

1920
01:29:38,741 --> 01:29:40,467
to, like, really,
really show off who you are.

1921
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:42,703
- That's all I wanted to say.
- Thank you. It's a hot seat, though.

1922
01:29:42,745 --> 01:29:44,237
- It is, but... (laughs)
- HEIDI: But thank you.

1923
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:45,914
- We love you.
- PROBST: All right.

1924
01:29:46,014 --> 01:29:48,984
Who wants to get us into
the physical part of this game?

1925
01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:52,187
Uh, I just want to talk quickly
about the challenges.

1926
01:29:52,287 --> 01:29:54,314
You know, I think you all know
that I had a lot of fun

1927
01:29:54,356 --> 01:29:56,492
with the challenges,
and I was just curious

1928
01:29:56,592 --> 01:29:58,952
how you thought you would come
in and perform in challenges.

1929
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:01,329
And I'll start with Carolyn,
'cause you've been

1930
01:30:01,464 --> 01:30:03,165
so open about
your challenge performance

1931
01:30:03,265 --> 01:30:05,526
- that I just want to give you a chance to speak.
- Here I am.

1932
01:30:05,568 --> 01:30:07,169
- (laughing)
- Yeah, um,

1933
01:30:07,269 --> 01:30:08,971
well, first off, let me say,

1934
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:11,239
I'm an athletic person
in real life,

1935
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:15,010
so I'm not joking...
I thought I would do great.

1936
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:16,945
And it was, like,

1937
01:30:17,045 --> 01:30:19,081
one embarrassing thing
happened after the other.

1938
01:30:19,181 --> 01:30:20,516
Like, I got stuck
in a spiderweb,

1939
01:30:20,616 --> 01:30:22,851
and so it was just humiliating.

1940
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:25,688
And I hear your voice, Jeff,
and I had to tune you out,

1941
01:30:25,788 --> 01:30:27,890
but I needed to hear it,
like, "Keep going!"

1942
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:31,093
And I'm like, "I know."
And then I got my letter.

1943
01:30:31,193 --> 01:30:33,462
"Mom, I hope
you're winning challenges."

1944
01:30:33,562 --> 01:30:37,600
It broke my heart reading that,
and it was so hard.

1945
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,502
It was so hard.

1946
01:30:40,536 --> 01:30:44,106
To see myself,
like, failing at them.

1947
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:47,576
But then, at the same time,
I promised my son I wouldn't

1948
01:30:47,676 --> 01:30:50,412
talk poorly about myself,
because that's what I teach him

1949
01:30:50,513 --> 01:30:51,480
is positive self-talk.

1950
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,849
So all I could do is just accept

1951
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:56,118
that I'm not at that level,
and it's okay.

1952
01:30:56,218 --> 01:30:58,320
PROBST: And, Carolyn,
I just want to say, -Amen.

1953
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:00,222
I never see it as humiliating.

1954
01:31:00,322 --> 01:31:02,002
I see somebody
giving everything they have.

1955
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:04,159
And anybody who sits at home

1956
01:31:04,259 --> 01:31:06,695
and talks smack
about you and the spiderweb

1957
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:09,155
- should come out here and apply to be on Survivor.
- (all agreeing)

1958
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:11,534
Instead of sitting
on your couch talking smack.

1959
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,768
(laughing)

1960
01:31:12,868 --> 01:31:14,260
- YAM YAM: Yes.
- PROBST: It's not easy.

1961
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,171
HEIDI: Seeing Carolyn
trying inspired me,

1962
01:31:16,271 --> 01:31:18,206
and I want to use it
to inspire my kids.

1963
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,708
Like, this is what you do.

1964
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:22,110
You-you are not gonna
be good at certain things.

1965
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,730
You might struggle
with certain things,

1966
01:31:23,779 --> 01:31:25,213
but you keep trying.

1967
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:27,182
And she's still here
in the top three.

1968
01:31:27,282 --> 01:31:29,451
- So props to you, because you inspire me.
- Thank you.

1969
01:31:29,552 --> 01:31:30,919
Thank you.

1970
01:31:31,019 --> 01:31:32,821
CARSON: And, Heidi,
let's dig into day 25,

1971
01:31:32,921 --> 01:31:36,291
where you not only won immunity,

1972
01:31:36,391 --> 01:31:37,560
but you put yourself

1973
01:31:37,593 --> 01:31:39,762
in a vulnerable position
to make fire.

1974
01:31:39,862 --> 01:31:41,387
- HEIDI: Yeah.
- Even though you didn't have to.

1975
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:42,831
But I want you
to talk about that,

1976
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:44,700
because that was part
of your physical game.

1977
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,569
Yeah.
So, thank you for the question,

1978
01:31:46,602 --> 01:31:48,261
and I'm so proud
I pulled through that one.

1979
01:31:48,303 --> 01:31:52,074
And I think I was perceived as,
"She had a good game,

1980
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:54,710
"but she doesn't
have this in the bag." Right?

1981
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:57,079
I think if I didn't
go for fire yesterday,

1982
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:58,814
I would have
never won this game.

1983
01:31:58,914 --> 01:32:01,149
And not that
I'm saying I'm winning,

1984
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:02,643
but it gives me
the best opportunity

1985
01:32:02,685 --> 01:32:04,587
to plead my case here,

1986
01:32:04,687 --> 01:32:06,755
because I truly think
Carson was very much

1987
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:09,725
the brains of what was
happening with a lot of this.

1988
01:32:09,825 --> 01:32:12,060
So I had to make a big move.

1989
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,062
And it so happened
that it happened on day 25.

1990
01:32:14,162 --> 01:32:18,266
And not only did you just make
fire when you didn't have to,

1991
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:22,204
you made fire the fastest
in the history of Survivor.

1992
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:24,039
That I didn't expect,

1993
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:26,374
but if that's
a record or whatever,

1994
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:29,411
I take it, because
this game is amazing.

1995
01:32:29,511 --> 01:32:32,748
And I'll put a plug that maybe
we can make history today,

1996
01:32:32,848 --> 01:32:34,617
because
if you vote for me to win,

1997
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:38,721
I will be the oldest
female contestant winner.

1998
01:32:38,821 --> 01:32:41,624
- CARSON: Wow.
- So we can make even more history together.

1999
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,225
- (laughing)
- Vote for me.

2000
01:32:43,325 --> 01:32:45,185
- But thank you for the question.
- CARSON: Yeah.

2001
01:32:45,227 --> 01:32:47,863
And, you know, Yam Yam
and Heidi, you made it through

2002
01:32:47,963 --> 01:32:49,965
a lot of challenges
that you didn't win.

2003
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,967
You know, Yam Yam,
I'll go to you.

2004
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,502
Like, how did it feel
to perform the challenges,

2005
01:32:54,637 --> 01:32:56,037
maybe differently
than you expected,

2006
01:32:56,104 --> 01:33:00,308
but then how was it when
you finally did pull it out?

2007
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:03,378
So, the physical aspect of the
challenge was super scary to me.

2008
01:33:03,478 --> 01:33:07,650
Like, super scary, because
I'm not a physical person.

2009
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,117
I don't have good balance.

2010
01:33:09,217 --> 01:33:11,286
I'm not fast.
I'm afraid of heights.

2011
01:33:11,386 --> 01:33:13,756
But I'm coming
from a very physical family.

2012
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,123
Like, my father is a cyclist.

2013
01:33:15,223 --> 01:33:16,992
My brother
has been athlete of the year

2014
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:19,527
and played in every single
sports team until now.

2015
01:33:19,662 --> 01:33:21,688
Like, I am, like, just the kid
that watched TV, you know?

2016
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,766
So I had to channel them.

2017
01:33:23,866 --> 01:33:26,301
I had to channel their energy,
their words, their strength.

2018
01:33:26,401 --> 01:33:28,804
And that's what happened
to the last gasp challenge.

2019
01:33:28,904 --> 01:33:31,173
And I had no idea
I had it in me.

2020
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:33,075
I was doing everything
that I could do

2021
01:33:33,175 --> 01:33:34,442
to distract from your voice,

2022
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,236
which is very supporting,
but it's very annoying

2023
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:38,681
(laughing) - when you're
in the middle of a challenge.

2024
01:33:38,747 --> 01:33:40,115
And if I win,

2025
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:43,418
I'll be the first Puerto Rican
male to win tonight.

2026
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:45,420
(laughing)

2027
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,855
HEIDI: I love that.

2028
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,323
PROBST: All right, let's move

2029
01:33:48,423 --> 01:33:50,926
into the last section,
which does involve strategy,

2030
01:33:51,026 --> 01:33:53,796
idols, and advantages
and how you use them.

2031
01:33:53,896 --> 01:33:55,230
Who wants to get us going?

2032
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:58,100
Yeah. So, Carolyn,
you had your name written down

2033
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,567
three times
throughout the game...

2034
01:33:59,702 --> 01:34:01,169
The least
out of the three of you.

2035
01:34:01,269 --> 01:34:04,840
You were on the right side
of the vote 88.89% of the time.

2036
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:06,408
Very impressive.

2037
01:34:06,508 --> 01:34:09,277
Walk me through
the strategy of that.

2038
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:13,548
Um, part of my strategy
was putting my trust in,

2039
01:34:13,716 --> 01:34:15,350
one, Carson,

2040
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:18,286
you, who again,
we were so much alike.

2041
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:20,786
- Some of the bickering was kind of play...
- Was on purpose.

2042
01:34:20,856 --> 01:34:23,425
We played it up, but a lot
of it, too, it wasn't.

2043
01:34:23,525 --> 01:34:24,851
And it was
a risk to work with you,

2044
01:34:24,893 --> 01:34:28,096
but still, I was
underestimated so much that

2045
01:34:28,196 --> 01:34:31,333
when it came to me finding
that idol, nobody expected that.

2046
01:34:31,433 --> 01:34:32,859
Nobody. Plus,
I didn't say a word about it.

2047
01:34:32,901 --> 01:34:35,103
But your idol
being played on Carson,

2048
01:34:35,203 --> 01:34:36,538
you didn't
need to play on Carson.

2049
01:34:36,638 --> 01:34:38,198
You needed to trust me
that Lauren and Jaime

2050
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,100
were gonna vote the way they
said, and I told you, like...

2051
01:34:40,142 --> 01:34:41,534
CAROLYN: Okay, so
here's the difference is

2052
01:34:41,576 --> 01:34:43,011
- do I trust you? Yes.
- Yes.

2053
01:34:43,111 --> 01:34:45,613
Did I trust Lauren and Jaime?
No.

2054
01:34:45,748 --> 01:34:48,550
But I knew that
I needed Carson here

2055
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:50,618
to assure that Danny went home,

2056
01:34:50,753 --> 01:34:52,821
'cause I wasn't gonna
get to the end with you here.

2057
01:34:52,921 --> 01:34:54,047
- I needed the three.
- DANNY: Why?

2058
01:34:54,089 --> 01:34:55,415
How did I logically
get in your way?

2059
01:34:55,457 --> 01:34:56,616
'Cause that's
a very specific thing to say.

2060
01:34:56,658 --> 01:34:59,594
Because you were
seemingly running things,

2061
01:34:59,762 --> 01:35:01,063
were the one controlling votes.

2062
01:35:01,163 --> 01:35:02,931
You were the one
coming up with plans.

2063
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:06,468
You were influencing
Jaime, Lauren, Heidi.

2064
01:35:06,568 --> 01:35:08,003
I needed you out.

2065
01:35:08,971 --> 01:35:10,372
Cool. Well put.

2066
01:35:10,472 --> 01:35:12,307
CARSON: Okay, great. Thank you.

2067
01:35:12,407 --> 01:35:14,977
Yam Yam,
you voted 90% of the time

2068
01:35:15,077 --> 01:35:16,378
on the right side of the votes.

2069
01:35:16,478 --> 01:35:18,013
I've worked with you personally.

2070
01:35:18,113 --> 01:35:19,973
I saw how you kind of
controlled your own destiny.

2071
01:35:20,015 --> 01:35:22,450
Can you explain how you
continued to have control

2072
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,552
throughout this game,
strategically?

2073
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:26,154
This game
is about getting to the end.

2074
01:35:26,254 --> 01:35:27,881
If you don't get to the end,
you don't get to win.

2075
01:35:27,923 --> 01:35:29,825
And I knew
there were people in the way

2076
01:35:29,925 --> 01:35:31,960
of me getting to the end.
So I wanted people

2077
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,796
that had the comfort
of writing my name down

2078
01:35:33,896 --> 01:35:35,463
not be here
playing the game with me,

2079
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37,090
'cause they were gonna
get that little feeling,

2080
01:35:37,132 --> 01:35:38,424
the good feeling
of writing my name again.

2081
01:35:38,466 --> 01:35:40,668
And it was
with the help of everybody,

2082
01:35:40,803 --> 01:35:43,071
but it happened
because I wanted it to happen.

2083
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:47,542
So my game is about knowing
who wants to work with me,

2084
01:35:47,642 --> 01:35:49,444
who thinks I'm not a threat.

2085
01:35:49,544 --> 01:35:51,179
I won a necklace,
and I wasn't a threat,

2086
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:52,680
because I made myself
not a threat.

2087
01:35:52,815 --> 01:35:54,917
I really love talking.

2088
01:35:55,017 --> 01:35:56,318
I cannot go into a challenge

2089
01:35:56,418 --> 01:35:59,121
and push the biggest block
or jump the highest

2090
01:35:59,221 --> 01:36:00,722
or do the best balancing.

2091
01:36:00,823 --> 01:36:03,625
What I can do
is I can talk, talk, talk, talk,

2092
01:36:03,725 --> 01:36:06,494
in a way that
people were comfortable

2093
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:08,563
to feel like,
"He's here just to have fun."

2094
01:36:08,663 --> 01:36:10,223
I'm here to have fun,
but I want to win.

2095
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:12,600
And I hope
I make my family proud

2096
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:15,037
and my brother proud,
because he told me,

2097
01:36:15,137 --> 01:36:17,139
"They pick you
because of who you are.

2098
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:18,899
"Just be yourself. You're gonna
do okay." That's all I need.

2099
01:36:18,941 --> 01:36:20,466
And that's all that
I keep repeating to myself.

2100
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:23,311
I just need to be who I am,
and I'm proud of it.

2101
01:36:23,411 --> 01:36:24,847
CARSON: Great. Thank you.

2102
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,016
So, Heidi, you were
on the right side of the vote

2103
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:30,485
66.67% of the time.

2104
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:32,554
How did you navigate through

2105
01:36:32,654 --> 01:36:34,080
- your game, strategically?
- HEIDI: Yeah.

2106
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:37,960
My strategy coming into this
was not to have this.

2107
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,295
Okay?
However, the way it happened,

2108
01:36:40,395 --> 01:36:43,098
I had to keep adapting
to survive here.

2109
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:45,767
And the difference
between some of the people here

2110
01:36:45,868 --> 01:36:48,570
and myself was like,
"Oh, my God, I'm by myself.

2111
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:49,872
How am I gonna able control it?"

2112
01:36:49,905 --> 01:36:51,673
And maybe that's
part of the reason why,

2113
01:36:51,773 --> 01:36:54,509
like, I kept my idol
a little bit longer.

2114
01:36:54,609 --> 01:36:56,111
So I hope you respect
the fact that

2115
01:36:56,211 --> 01:36:58,881
I had to adapt, and it hurt.

2116
01:36:58,981 --> 01:37:03,351
It hurt. And you hit
the high highs, it's awesome,

2117
01:37:03,451 --> 01:37:05,620
but not until
you hit that low low

2118
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,056
is when you truly find yourself
and you realize

2119
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:10,125
this game goes way beyond money.

2120
01:37:10,225 --> 01:37:11,994
This game is all about
finding myself

2121
01:37:12,094 --> 01:37:15,297
and realizing the growth,
because I've been in the U.S.

2122
01:37:15,397 --> 01:37:18,133
almost 20 years,
but when I moved, I struggle.

2123
01:37:18,233 --> 01:37:19,534
I couldn't speak English.

2124
01:37:19,634 --> 01:37:22,770
I didn't have anything.
And that made me grow.

2125
01:37:22,905 --> 01:37:25,507
Like, I see the growth in me,
and now seeing that I'm here,

2126
01:37:25,607 --> 01:37:28,243
living my dream, I truly
am living the American dream.

2127
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:31,213
So for those people
that sound different,

2128
01:37:31,313 --> 01:37:33,581
look different, want to be
in science and they're girls,

2129
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:36,284
follow your dreams, no matter
what age or who you are.

2130
01:37:36,384 --> 01:37:37,920
You're female, male,

2131
01:37:37,953 --> 01:37:40,255
whatever age you are, follow
your dreams no matter what.

2132
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:42,925
And that's the reason I'm here.

2133
01:37:50,565 --> 01:37:51,699
PROBST: I love this.

2134
01:37:51,799 --> 01:37:53,468
Right before
we get ready to vote...

2135
01:37:53,568 --> 01:37:55,328
- Carolyn.
- One last hug with the final three.

2136
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,605
It's-it's crazy to be here.

2137
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,841
- It's a privilege.
- PROBST: You did a great job.

2138
01:37:59,942 --> 01:38:03,445
The only thing left to do now
is for the jury vote

2139
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:06,081
for who they think
is most deserving

2140
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:08,050
of the title of Sole Survivor

2141
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:11,219
and the million dollars
that goes with it.

2142
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:12,512
Jury, I'm gonna
give you a moment

2143
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:14,089
to take in everything
you've heard,

2144
01:38:14,189 --> 01:38:16,624
collect your thoughts,
and then we vote.
