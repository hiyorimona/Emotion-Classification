have written
you letters to encourage you.

176
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:32,965
So you've got food,
shelter and love.

177
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:34,482
Biggest reward of the season.

178
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:38,000
Choose one person to join
you tonight at the sanctuary.

179
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:43,103
FRANNIE: Jeff, um, as soon
as you say that family's involved,

180
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:46,275
this becomes
a whole different question.

181
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,586
So... [sighs]

182
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,103
Carolyn.

183
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:52,103
PROBST: Carolyn, come
on over. Why Carolyn?

184
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:56,137
I know she's missing
her son so much, and...

185
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:59,344
[sobbing]

186
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:09,931
PROBST: Frannie, choose
one more person to join you.

187
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:15,793
I'm gonna go with Lauren.

188
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,482
[crying] - 'Cause I know she
hasn't been eating as much,

189
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:19,958
and I know
she misses her son so much.

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,896
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
[sniffles]

192
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:28,137
FRANNIE: I'm so sorry.

193
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,758
PROBST: Now it's really tricky.

194
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:32,448
One spot left.

195
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,136
- FRANNIE: Oh, my God.
- Oh...

196
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,517
Oh, my gosh.

197
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,620
[breathing sharply]

198
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:40,102
Heidi.

199
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,517
PROBST: Heidi, come on over.

200
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,724
I'm sorry.

201
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:44,147
- I'm sorry, Danny.
- That's okay.

202
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,000
PROBST: Three moms.

203
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:47,793
[laughs]

204
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:48,931
[Heidi sniffles]

205
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,310
PROBST:
All right, Frannie, Carolyn,

206
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:55,310
Lauren, Heidi, head out.
Boat's gonna pick you up.

207
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,034
Take you to the sanctuary.

208
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,724
You'll return to camp tomorrow.

209
00:08:58,827 --> 00:08:59,931
Enjoy.

210
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:01,344
Have fun.

211
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,544
- Bye, guys. Have fun.
- PROBST: All right.

212
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:04,448
Danny, Carson, Jaime, Yam Yam,

213
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:06,793
got nothing for you.
Head back to camp.

214
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:09,758
FRANNIE: For me, winning
this challenge is bittersweet.

215
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:11,758
This is probably
the biggest reward

216
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:15,517
of this season of Survivor,
and I get to be there

217
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,206
with these
other three amazing women,

218
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,551
but I see their faces
when I win for a third time.

219
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:24,137
It's simpleSurvivor strategy.

220
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,827
Take out the person who could,
in theory, win every challenge.

221
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:37,275
If you want this, you got
to apply to be on Survivor.

223
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:49,000
JAIME: Okay, so how many
scoops am I doing?

224
00:09:49,103 --> 00:09:50,413
Like 4,000.

CARSON: Four thou... [laughs]

00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:53,655
I'm excited. Thank, y'all.

JAIME: Thank you, guys.

228
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,758
I'm happy you're excited.
I'm... mad. I wanted food.

229
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,896
I'm the only person
that hasn't gotten a reward now.

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,655
I would have loved tacos,

231
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:05,517
but this is a lot more
than just food.

232
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:11,413
Like, was there anyone
specifically you were looking

233
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:13,724
to get letters from?

234
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:15,862
- What?
- [sniffles]

235
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:19,724
YAM YAM: The fact
that I know that my letter

236
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,413
is in Jeff's hand, and I'm not
gonna be able to read it...

237
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:24,896
It's heartbreaking.
I was looking forward

238
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,241
to reading a letter from Karim,

239
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:28,620
my husband.

240
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:30,655
He always writes
really nice stuff.

241
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:34,551
My mother...
She's, like, super energetic

242
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,965
and she always
gives me strength.

243
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:38,751
It would have been nice
to read some letters

244
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:40,689
and have some peace of mind
that they're okay.

245
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,172
You know?

246
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,137
DANNY: You're missing
your husband bad, huh?

247
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:47,655
Hey, man, this is gonna
make it that much more sweeter.

248
00:10:47,758 --> 00:10:49,026
- DANNY: No, you're not stupid, man, you're...
- No.

249
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:50,413
DANNY: You're feeling it,

250
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,820
and you're talking to us
'cause we're close.

251
00:10:51,862 --> 00:10:53,379
- It's real.
- Yeah.

252
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:55,793
The only good thing
about being here is that

253
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:58,275
I get to sit down
with Jaime and Danny,

254
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,896
which I really haven't talked
serious strategy,

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,655
and lay out a plan
that may benefit us.

256
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:06,172
How do you be a good player
and not look at Frannie

257
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:07,475
as somebody
that needs to be taken out?

258
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:08,958
- She's three and 0. Um...
- CARSON: Yeah.

259
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,965
She's three and 0,
no one's beating Frannie, and

260
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:12,440
she knows puzzles,
she's a beast at comps.

261
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:14,379
- I agree. I agree. I agree.
- She can balance.

262
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:16,310
She has strength.

263
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:17,682
CARSON: As of this morning,
Frannie wasn't even

264
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:20,275
on the radar,
but she's won three

265
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,751
out of the five
individual challenges.

266
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:23,724
That's saying something, and so,

267
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:25,620
being able
to use that against her

268
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:27,344
can be
a really effective strategy

269
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:28,931
to kind of bond us together

270
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:30,371
because we didn't get
to eat the delicious food.

271
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:31,820
We didn't get
to read our family letters

272
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:34,068
from home, and so, now,

273
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:37,551
tides have shifted. It could
be Frannie going home next.

[screaming, gasping, muttering]

00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:48,310
FRANNIE: I walk into
the sanctuary, and I see

277
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,862
everything you possibly need
to have a good time.

278
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:54,068
Tacos and margaritas, you know?

279
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,344
What more could you want?

280
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,586
- Do it.
- [screaming]

281
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:03,448
Yeah.

282
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:05,482
- [screaming]
- Yeah.

283
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:06,965
Salud!

- HEIDI: What?
- LAUREN: Like what? - So good.

00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,862
- CAROLYN: Ooh!
- [laughter]

287
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:18,724
- Best reward ever.
- CAROLYN: Yes.

288
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:20,862
This, like,
couldn't be a better four.

289
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:22,233
I'm so glad
that you did think about it,

290
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,862
like, too, as, like, moms,

291
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:25,820
- and, like, you know what I mean?
- Thank you so much.

292
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:28,241
Like, that's so human and so...

293
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:30,344
Ugh. Like, I just...
I appreciate it.

294
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:33,034
Frannie, like, thank you.

295
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:35,647
FRANNIE: As soon as I
knew I was gonna have

296
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,965
to choose people,
I couldn't help but think

297
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:40,931
about the moms out here
on this island,

298
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:43,551
and Carolyn is somebody who

299
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:46,000
I want to build
a relationship with.

300
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:48,137
I don't always feel
like I fit in.

301
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:52,103
And she is
so unabashedly herself that

302
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,413
it's inspiring to me.

303
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:54,931
CAROLYN: I'm so nervous.

304
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:56,862
HEIDI:
I am, too. I'm not gonna lie.

305
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:02,517
- Oh. All right.
- [crying, sniffling]

306
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:10,965
[sniffling]

307
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:16,413
You know, my daddy is not,
like, an emotional person.

308
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:17,965
And, like...

309
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,241
And, like...

310
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:22,724
[crying]

311
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,344
Both of my boys...

312
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:31,413
They were just letting me know,
like, they're doing so well.

313
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:34,620
But for my dad... that was
probably the most memorable.

314
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:37,655
Him saying like,
"When others doubted you,

315
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:42,793
you always persevered."
And it's so true, like...

316
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:46,241
Being married and then
going through a divorce...

317
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:48,793
Like, I'm single,
on my own, like,

318
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:52,379
and many people in my family
have been, like, on welfare.

319
00:13:52,482 --> 00:13:53,992
And, like, my dad was like,
"You're gonna...

320
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,923
"you're gonna have to
figure something out because...

321
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:58,344
because you're gonna
be that way."

322
00:13:58,448 --> 00:13:59,827
And I was like, "No, I'm not."

323
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:02,379
I went, and I got two jobs.

324
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:04,689
I went back to school,
and I got my master's.

325
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:07,103
And then,
even withSurvivor, like,

326
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,655
I'm telling my family, I'm like,

327
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:12,655
"I'm gonna apply for that
show and I'm gonna go."

328
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:15,344
And they're like,
"No, you're not."

329
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:19,068
Then, I'm freaking here. Like,

330
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:22,172
I have surpassed, like,
everybody's expectations,

331
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:26,103
and I'm a living example
for other women to know,

332
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:28,827
like, doesn't matter
your circumstance.

333
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:31,241
You can do it.

334
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:33,144
It's crazy to think
a letter can mean so much.

335
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,448
CAROLYN: Yeah.

336
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:36,586
And my son hates writing.

337
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:39,379
Like, he doesn't like
writing at all.

338
00:14:39,482 --> 00:14:42,379
So it's, like, this is probably
the most he's ever...

339
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,068
[laughter] - I've never seen
him draw anything like that.

340
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,724
I don't even know what that is.

341
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:49,000
[snorts]

342
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:50,958
CAROLYN: I feel like I had a
good relationship with Frannie,

343
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,758
but going on this reward
with her, like,

344
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:55,482
took it to a whole new level.

345
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:57,586
And I know that
Frannie's a threat, and, like...

346
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,827
But I'm like, "I don't want
to ever vote her out now."

347
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,379
To see you, Frannie, winning...

348
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:04,103
I'm literally living
through you, and I think

349
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:06,379
we should keep up the whole,
like, women winning.

350
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:08,137
HEIDI: I agree.

351
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,992
- After all, we got this.
- LAUREN: Yeah. - FRANNIE: Yes.

352
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,544
- Yes. - LAUREN: Yeah.
- CAROLYN: Okay.

353
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:13,034
We're not just talking,
we're real?

354
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:15,097
- I'm manifesting it.
- CAROLYN: What do you mean?

355
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:18,862
Tomorrow, we're gonna win it.

356
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:20,440
Oh, I thought you were saying,
"Vote Danny out."

357
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:24,241
[laughter]

358
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:26,224
- I'm down for it.
- CAROLYN: When are you ready

359
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,889
- to let go of Danny?
- FRANNIE: Yeah, yeah.

360
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:30,758
- Let's-let's ask that question.
- That's the true question.

361
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:33,379
I have no ties to Danny.
We never said "Oh, final two."

362
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:36,620
'Cause we both know we're gonna
kick each other out

363
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:38,068
whenever it's time to.

364
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,785
- It's time tomorrow.
- Well, is it time to?

365
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:41,034
It-it could be.

366
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:47,206
CARSON: I'm not...

367
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,655
Heidi will vote out Frannie
next-next Tribal 100%.

368
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:55,647
That's the only thing...
Like, the letters.

369
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:58,379
JAIME: With Carolyn, I know
that that's gonna be tough.

370
00:15:58,482 --> 00:15:59,854
So you guys have
to come up with the story

371
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,241
that you're gonna tell her.

372
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:02,785
Like, what name is
she gonna write down?

373
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:04,578
DANNY: Well, if you want
a really believable plan?

374
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,199
- What's that?
- We could just say we're trying to flush your idol.

375
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:10,344
And that'll be really...
that'll be really cool.

376
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:12,965
- Do you want me to tell you what happened to my idol?
- Yes.

377
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:15,448
JAIME: It's time to come clean.

378
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:16,965
The only reason that my name

379
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:19,034
was ever brought up
or ever written down

380
00:16:19,137 --> 00:16:20,965
is because they thought
that I had the idol.

381
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:22,482
- Okay, so...
- Do you have an idol?

382
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:23,862
I hadan idol.

383
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:26,793
We thought that somebody had.

384
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:30,034
Knowledge Is Power,
so Lauren gave me

385
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:31,379
her extra vote to protect it.

386
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:33,206
I gave my idol to Kane.

387
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,413
Kane was voted out.
The idol's gone.

388
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:37,793
Wow.

389
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,517
It's a good story.

390
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,586
That's just what it is.
It's a story.

391
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,275
Actually, um, I take that back.

392
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,551
It's a horrible story.
It's absolute B.S.

393
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:46,958
Isn't it such
an unbelievable story, though?

394
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,233
They're gonna be like,
"Yeah, right.

395
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,620
You gave your idol to Kane?"

396
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:51,199
- Like, I legit don't have the idol.
- Yeah.

397
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:52,551
JAIME: After coming clean,

398
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:55,310
I really believe
the target is off my back.

399
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,482
I do believe that Danny,

400
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:59,965
Yam Yam and Carson believed me.

401
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:01,517
Yeah, that story's total B.S.

402
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,130
CARSON: And now
we're doing an idol search

403
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:04,475
- because there's one out there.
- DANNY: No, no, yeah.

404
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:05,750
You know, good on her
for at least trying that.

405
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,413
CARSON: It was so good.

406
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:08,992
It's honestly put her more
on my radar

407
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:11,517
- because it's like, "Wow, she's good."
- Yeah.

408
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:14,792
- All right.
- Hmm?

409
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,647
DANNY: My game plan
moving forward now is simple.

410
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:17,992
If Frannie loses
an immunity challenge,

411
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,550
we vote her out.

412
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:22,758
If she wins, we vote Jaime out
or flush the idol.

413
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:24,344
I can get Heidi on board.

414
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:25,716
Does your gut say
it's too early for...

415
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:27,034
- For Danny?
- Mm-hmm.

416
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:29,448
No. Uh, he wouldn't expect it.

417
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,103
It has to be a blindside.

418
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:34,620
Danny and I are close allies,
but I want to make sure

419
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:36,724
they know that I'm here
to play the game.

420
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:39,758
It's not just I'm saving Danny.
I'm actually playing this game

421
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:42,655
for myself and for my family,
not for Danny.

422
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:54,137
Va Va.

423
00:17:58,241 --> 00:17:59,448
Good morning.

424
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,965
Welcome home.

425
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,172
I was up at the crack of dawn
just waiting

426
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:04,578
for the women
to come home because

427
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,931
I was so excited
to finally share

428
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:09,344
the truth about my idol.

429
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:10,896
I did have the idol.

430
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,793
Because we were fearful
of Pow... Knowledge Is Power,

431
00:18:13,896 --> 00:18:16,275
I gave my idol

432
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:19,517
to Kane to hold,
and then Kane was voted off,

433
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,793
- and he walked away with it.
- Are you serious?

434
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:23,241
JAIME: It feels good.

435
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:24,896
I'm finally free!

436
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,586
The truth shall set you free.

437
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, my God, Jaime,
why didn't you, like, stop it?

438
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,130
Oh, but it's so public. I would
have been like, "Stop!"

439
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:32,482
I would... I know.

440
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:33,896
JAIME: Lying and keeping secrets

441
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,344
is the name of the game,

442
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,827
but it's a lot of weight
on your chest, so,

443
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:40,517
I love being honest. [Laughs]

444
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:43,413
Don't tell anyone
when I said that.

445
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:45,827
- I appreciate you saying that.
- Yeah, totally.

446
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,931
I mean, I had heard
that you had one.

447
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:51,517
I smell bull. Oh, no.

448
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,068
Oh, man. How great is it?

449
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:55,551
FRANNIE: Are you kidding me?

450
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:58,310
Really? You know, Jaime,
do you think we're that silly?

451
00:18:58,413 --> 00:18:59,551
It's too much.

452
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,448
What, does she think
we're all idiots?

453
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:03,448
FRANNIE:
And the fact that she can lie

454
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,310
right to your face
only exacerbates for me

455
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:10,206
the idea that Jaime's
a dangerous player in this game.

456

457

Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

470

For today's challenge,
your feet will be tied together.

through a final obstacle
and then race to finish

480
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:32,379
a star-shaped puzzle.

00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:37,379
First person to finish

- Ooh.

You got to really attack this.

- [grunting]
- What Danny's doing.

498
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:31,793
Keep that mouth
holding on to your buoy.

It is crazy. You're good, Danny.

Untie your hands and your feet.
It is everybody

- trying to catch Danny right now.
- [grunting, screaming]

507
00:21:55,724 --> 00:21:57,964
Now you're gonna maneuver
that buoy through the obstacle.

Here comes Carson. Lauren doing
a good job. Here comes Heidi.

Here comes Frannie. It's Jaime
and Yam Yam in dead last.

You're maneuvering that buoy now
through an obstacle.

511
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:10,310
It's about rope management.

00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,000
Carson's made up a lot of time.

515
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:16,448
Here comes Heidi.

516
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:18,137
Frannie's in it now.
Here comes Lauren.

517
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:20,724
Yam Yam heads over
that first hill.

518
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,482
There goes Jaime
over the first hill.

519
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:26,344
- Carolyn still struggling. She's sideways.
- [grunts]

520
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:30,172
Carson, you're good. Untie.

521
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:32,655
You're good, Heidi. Untie.

522
00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:34,103
You're good, Frannie. Untie.

523
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:36,275
You're good, Lauren. Untie.

524
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:41,344
Now you're maneuvering that buoy
through one more obstacle.

525
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:44,137
This is all about managing
that rope and the slack.

526
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:46,000
You got to create slack.

527
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:48,206
And it's Danny in the lead.
Let's go, Carolyn!

528
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,931
You're almost there.
Get your face on the mat.

529
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:53,586
You're good, Carolyn.
You're good.

530
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:57,137
Danny has his buoy through.

531
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,482
You're good, Jaime.

532
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,965
Danny first up to the puzzle.

533
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:05,206
Everybody is working on
their buoy except for Yam Yam.

534
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,000
You're almost there, Yam Yam.
You are good, Yam Yam. Untie.

535
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:11,965
Yam Yam is now in it.

536
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:17,310
Heidi's through.
She can untie her puzzle pieces.

537
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:19,793
PROBST: Trying to work that buoy

538
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:22,206
through those ropes.

539
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,931
Carson is through.
He can untie his puzzle pieces.

540
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:27,241
The faster
you get through that obstacle,

541
00:23:27,344 --> 00:23:29,310
the faster
you get to your puzzle.

542
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:31,103
Carson's up here.

543
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:35,000
Frannie's through.
She can untie her puzzle pieces.

544
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:38,689
Frannie's won two individual
immunity challenges already,

545
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,758
- plus a reward.
- Oh, my God.

546
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:42,448
She's up now working
on the puzzle.

547
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:44,655
There goes Lauren.
She's through.

548
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:48,379
Yam Yam is through.
Yam Yam made up a lot of time.

549
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:49,965
Yam Yam is now in it.

550
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:52,482
Look at that.

551
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:54,206
Lauren's up here.

552
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,965
Jaime's through.

553
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,199
- Oh, my God!
- PROBST: It is now

554
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,413
just Carolyn
working on the buoy.

555
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:01,793
- [shrieks]
- Everybody on the puzzle now,

556
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:03,586
except Carolyn.

557
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:05,137
Danny was first here,

558
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:09,000
but has made absolutely
zero progress on the puzzle.

559
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:11,241
Carson's getting progress going.

560
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:14,586
It is a complicated
star-shaped puzzle.

561
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:18,896
It's a complicated knot.

562
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,310
PROBST: It is Carson
in the lead right now.

563
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:23,379
Now Frannie's got some momentum.

564
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:26,655
It's now Frannie and Carson
side by side.

565
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:30,000
It is Carson now pulling away.

566
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:32,586
Frannie trying to catch Carson.

567
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:35,551
Carson down to four pieces left.

568
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:37,758
Oh, my... Who did this?

569
00:24:37,862 --> 00:24:39,379
Come on, man.

570
00:24:39,482 --> 00:24:41,793
Carson down to two pieces left.

571
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:45,448
Frannie trying to catch him.

572
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:46,965
It's gonna be too little,
too late.

573
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,034
Carson down to his last piece.

574
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,000
For immunity, does it fit?

575
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,379
He's got one piece left.
He can't get it to fit.

576
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:01,000
Frannie fighting.
Stay in this, now.

577
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:04,275
Carson now gonna
take a piece out.

578
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:07,413
Something is not right.
He's readjusting his puzzle.

579
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:10,275
Frannie moving faster now
with another piece.

580
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:13,551
Carson lost some momentum.
He seemed to be one piece away,

581
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:15,482
but it wasn't right.
He can't get it to fit.

582
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:17,482
That has opened the door

583
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:21,275
for Frannie,
who is trying to close the deal.

584
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:24,862
- Jeff?
- Carson rearranges again.

585
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:26,206
Thinks he has it.

586
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,862
And he does. Carson wins

587
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:30,931
- individual immunity.
- Oh, God.

588
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:32,965
- Safe tonight at Tribal Council.
- Wow.

589
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:35,827
PROBST:
Wow, that went together fast.

590
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:39,172
Carson, come on down.

591
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:41,482
- [whooping]
- Yeah!

592
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:43,931
- Yeah, Carson!
- Good job, Carson!

593
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:46,827
Before I put this on,
how's this feel?

594
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:48,344
It's incredible.

595
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:51,379
I never thought I would win
an individual immunity.

596
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:54,172
And so, being able
to put that puzzle together

597
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:57,793
against, like, some powerhouses
in this group... this is awesome.

598
00:25:57,896 --> 00:25:59,371
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

599
00:25:59,413 --> 00:26:01,448
- Yeah!
- [whooping]

600
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:03,724
Carson is safe tonight,

601
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:05,310
- cannot be voted out.
- Oh.

602
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:07,413
PROBST: As for the
rest of you, after 19 days,

603
00:26:07,517 --> 00:26:09,827
somebody will be
voted out tonight.

604
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:12,413
Eleventh person out of this
game, fourth member of our jury.

605
00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:13,877
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

606
00:26:13,931 --> 00:26:15,716
- See tonight a Tribal. Congrats.
- Thank you.

607
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:18,068
- YAM YAM: Congrats, Carson.
- Thank you.

608
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:19,448
DANNY: Not winning's never fun.

609
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:22,413
But I'm happy
it wasn't Frannie. So,

610
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:24,793
tonight's Tribal,
if it goes exactly how I want,

611
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,931
Frannie goes home.

612
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:27,827
She's a powerhouse in this game

613
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:30,241
and nobody wants to go
to the final three with her.

614
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:33,482
We have an opportunity right now
to strike. Let's strike.

615
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:44,275
DANNY: Way to go, Carson.

616
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:47,103
- That puzzle was awesome.
- Right. All right.

617
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,620
FRANNIE:
Of course I wanted Jeff to put

618
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:52,172
the immunity necklace around me
for the third time,

619
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:57,000
but there's kind of a sense
of renegade excitement in me

620
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:59,931
that I don't have
that security tonight.

621
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:02,586
- What do you think? Would you rather Jaime or Yam?
- Um...

622
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,344
I am...
I will be absolutely fine.

623
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:07,655
FRANNIE:
I have had some sort of security

624
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:10,275
every single Tribal Council
I've gone to.

625
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:15,310
So, I kind of haven't had
a chance yet in this game

626
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:19,103
to put my social strategy
to the test.

627
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:20,758
And I love tests, you know?

628
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:24,517
I...

629
00:27:25,517 --> 00:27:27,551
Yeah.

630
00:27:28,586 --> 00:27:30,965
I-I just keep thinking Danny,
but again...

631
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,308
- HEIDI: I'm okay with that.
- Yeah, I'm good with Danny.

632
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:36,586
Me, neither.

633
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,544
- HEIDI: Yeah.
- I'd rather just...

634
00:27:39,586 --> 00:27:40,931
Like,
we all know she has an idol.

635
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,164
Carson,
you're the necklace holder.

636
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:43,606
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

637
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:45,337
My idea would be to split it
between the two of them...

638
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:46,931
Three-three... and on a revote,

639
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,758
if Jaime doesn't play her idol,
vote her.

640
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:51,448
Okay.

641
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,275
So what are you thinking?

642
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:57,724
DANNY: Nobody's beating Frannie.

643
00:27:57,827 --> 00:27:59,578
Who wants to sit with her
at the final three?

644
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,103
I mean... [laughs]

645
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:03,827
- Are you down for that?
- I'm down.

646
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:06,172
Danny brings up Frannie's name,

647
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:08,827
which is mind-blowing to me,

648
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:11,793
because Danny hasn't been one
to talk strategy with me.

649
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:14,793
And then, also,
I just went on a reward with her

650
00:28:14,896 --> 00:28:16,448
at the sanctuary.

651
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:17,724
What about you?

652
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:21,206
Yeah.

653
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,751
We wanted to vote out Danny
at the sanctuary,

654
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:25,241
but I do think
it could be a good idea

655
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:27,068
to vote Frannie out of the game,

656
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,172
being that she has won
so many immunities.

657
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,965
- Everybody's on board with that?
- Mm-hmm.

658
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:33,448
- Yeah.
- All right.

659
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:35,337
YAM YAM: The fact
that Frannie lost the challenge

660
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:38,344
is huge for the tribe,
'cause now we can target her.

661
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:41,068
But I think Jaime's the biggest
threat out here right now.

662
00:28:41,172 --> 00:28:42,827
She might have an idol.

663
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,758
There's only eight of us,
and right now,

664
00:28:44,862 --> 00:28:46,551
Tika is making
all the decisions.

665
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:49,655
So I have to talk to Carson
to see what he wants to do.

666
00:28:49,758 --> 00:28:51,517
Danny wants to get Frannie out.

667
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,862
Yeah, so then, we can take...

668
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,164
But I also want
to get Jaime out.

669
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:55,509
I know.
I want to get Jaime out, too.

670
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:57,268
We just got to choose
which one we want to do.

671
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,931
And it's complicated 'cause
I don't really know what's best.

672
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:04,379
I want you, me and Carolyn
to be the closest to each other.

673
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:06,482
What I see brewing
is Carolyn forming

674
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:08,413
- a closer bond with Frannie.
- YAM YAM: Yeah.

675
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:10,034
[Carolyn groans]

676
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:13,000
CARSON: I think Carolyn
might have found a number one.

677
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:15,026
- That's...
- If you're feeling like we're gonna lose Carolyn

678
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:16,793
because Frannie's here, I think

679
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,496
getting rid
of Frannie's the best option.

680
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:20,034
But Carolyn gets really annoyed

681
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:21,896
when she's not included
in stuff.

682
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,620
True. It's scary.

683
00:29:23,724 --> 00:29:26,310
YAM YAM: Carson and I...
we might vote out Frannie,

684
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:28,344
but the worst thing
that could happen would be

685
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,482
that Carolyn finds out
about it because

686
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:33,724
she might not be
our ally anymore.

687
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:41,000
Who's everybody?

688
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:51,827
HEIDI: Danny wants to target
Frannie, and Frannie is trying

689
00:29:51,931 --> 00:29:53,896
to split
between Jaime and Danny.

690
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,551
Those are the three names I've
heard from different plans.

691
00:29:56,655 --> 00:29:58,000
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

692
00:29:58,103 --> 00:30:00,689
I don't feel good with any
of them, in all honesty.

693
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:02,793
But if I feel weird,
I do have an idol.

694
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:04,206
I am bringing it tonight.

695
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,793
Depending how I feel
at the moment,

696
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:07,724
I may or may not play it.

697
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:11,344
Are we comfortable?
Like, is someone going rogue?

698
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:13,413
- I don't think so.
- Danny's... voting for,

699
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:16,862
- um, Frannie.
- What?

700
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:19,000
He told me,
"I don't need your number

701
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:20,931
if you don't feel comfortable."

702
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:23,413
What. Wait. What?

703
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:25,117
So, who does he think
is voting with him?

704
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:27,931
Well, I think... I thought
he saw... He thought you guys.

705
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,068
- Not me.
- Not me.

706
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:33,413
CAROLYN: The plan was,
split it between Jaime and Danny.

707
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:34,931
That was the plan, I thought.

708
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:37,551
And then, I start hearing

709
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:39,241
this stuff about Frannie.

710
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:42,413
So he's saying because he
doesn't need you for the vote?

711
00:30:42,517 --> 00:30:45,103
- It doesn't matter.
- Well, what is he doing then?

712
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:50,482
Danny tells Heidi, "Oh,
I don't need you for a vote.

713
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:51,758
I already have the numbers."

714
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:54,448
He would never
say that to Heidi.

715
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,896
Something doesn't make sense.

716
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:06,137
Not knowing
who exactly is voting

717
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,517
for you if that's the vote
they've planned?

718
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:13,586
CAROLYN: Something's not right.

719
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:15,000
People are scared.

720
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:16,896
"Frannie wins all
the immunities." Who ca...

721
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,344
Like, I'm not
voting Frannie this vote,

722
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:21,095
and they know that, probably,
and are leaving me out.

723
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:22,448
I'm pissed.

724
00:31:22,551 --> 00:31:24,034
I think it's stupid.

725
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,785
Well, I know we always haven't
all been on the same page,

726
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:27,793
but, like, seriously,

727
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:29,862
are we gonna let Danny
control another vote?

728
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,551
Yes. Yeah.

729
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:39,241
[laughs]

730
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:41,304
- Us four and one more.
- CAROLYN: But, um, split?

731
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,751
- Maybe Carson.
- FRANNIE: Do you want...

732
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:45,655
- Let's... do it.
- Let's do it.

733
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:47,172
Oh, let's... do it.

734
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:50,413
Every single time everybody
thinks they have a plan,

735
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:51,820
she goes around
and she freaks out.

736
00:31:51,862 --> 00:31:53,095
And yet, she's the one who...
She's...

737
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:54,475
- Then ask him.
- FRANNIE: Yeah. Perfect.

738
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:57,068
- That was good.
- Hmm. Yeah.

739
00:31:57,172 --> 00:31:58,724
[Carolyn whoops]

740
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:00,241
This is what we're doing now.

741
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:03,931
Okay, I-I don't know
if I'm in yet, but tell me.

742
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:05,758
Me, Frannie, you,

743
00:32:05,862 --> 00:32:09,103
Lauren, Jaime for Heidi.

744
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,793
[laughs]

745
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,551
I don't like... I don't like
the last-minute thing.

746
00:32:14,655 --> 00:32:16,375
Sometimes the
last-minute stuff is the best.

747
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:18,793
CARSON:
We have this plan for Frannie,

748
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,965
but all of a sudden,
Carolyn and Frannie are trying

749
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:22,348
to now move the numbers
to Heidi.

750
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:25,241
And so,
I'm just trying to figure out

751
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,344
what the best course of action
is from now.

752
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:29,026
- I need to have a conversation.
- Mm-hmm. I don't...

753
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:31,620
with Yam Yam and Lauren
and-and Jaime.

754
00:32:31,724 --> 00:32:33,206
The best move for me,
I feel like,

755
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,206
would be to take out Frannie,
but doing so

756
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,689
would really risk
my relationship with Carolyn.

757
00:32:37,793 --> 00:32:41,275
But I do want Heidi out.
I can see right through her.

758
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:43,586
She is working this game
pretty well,

759
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:45,000
and she is a big threat.

760
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,620
CARSON: But I'm really not
sure what is going to happen.

761
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,379
And it's stressful,
it's chaotic.

762
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:00,862
I just wanted it to be simple,

763
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:03,379
but that never happens
with this group.

764
00:33:04,413 --> 00:33:07,724
In this game, I feel like
I've really tapped into

765
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:10,206
both of my chaotic
and clever side,

766
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,000
but right now I'm, like,
in full chaotic mode,

767
00:33:14,103 --> 00:33:17,517
and I know there's going to be
a betrayal either way.

768
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,551
I just have to decide
who I am betraying.

769
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:29,344
♪ ♪

770
00:33:51,241 --> 00:33:53,689
All right, let's start
with the reward challenge.

771
00:33:53,793 --> 00:33:56,379
Frannie, you win your third

772
00:33:56,482 --> 00:33:58,275
individual challenge,
and with it,

773
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:00,655
the power to choose three people
to go with you

774
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:02,724
on the biggest reward
of the season.

775
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:06,620
Sanctuary, food,
letters from home. Let's debate.

776
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:08,923
Is there a case to be made
that it's better to be chosen

777
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:12,551
- for that reward than to win?
- FRANNIE: Oh, yeah.

778
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:14,785
You know, I wanted to win
the challenge. I wanted tacos,

779
00:34:14,827 --> 00:34:16,482
and I wanted to be
in the sanctuary.

780
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:20,585
But, you know, you never want
to be the one who has to decide

781
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:21,968
who gets their letters
from home.

782
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:24,068
PROBST:
And Danny, make the other case...

783
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:27,000
Why you want to win a challenge
that shows

784
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:28,703
you're a competitor
and you're in charge.

785
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:30,310
DANNY: Jeff, there's a bunch

786
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,333
of Survivorlegends out there,
and they're legends

787
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:34,896
not because they lose a lot,
it's 'cause they win a lot.

788
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,551
Frannie put on
three performances

789
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:40,551
where she kicked ass, and the
game ain't over yet, so, yeah,

790
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:42,724
you want to play
to win the season, but also,

791
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:44,751
you don't want to just be good.
You want to be great.

792
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,673
You want to be one
of those players... the Robs,

793
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:48,379
the Parvs, the Jeremys.

794
00:34:48,482 --> 00:34:49,827
These are legends. Like,

795
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:51,682
- why not strive for that?
- PROBST: I agree with you.

796
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:53,896
That's the only way
to play Survivor

797
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,137
is full tilt boogie every single
second of every single day.

798
00:34:57,241 --> 00:34:59,241
- Wow. Full tilt boogie.
- [laughter]

799
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:01,206
I don't know
what full tilt boogie is.

800
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,590
Probably like this.
I don't know.

801
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:04,275
Full tilt boogie's
a state of mind.

802
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:05,793
- Oh, yeah.
- PROBST: It's like

803
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,061
you could call it "Club Condo."

804
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:08,586
You can call it
whatever you want.

805
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,206
It's just a state of mind.

806
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,931
So did I full tilt boogie
at the sanctuary?

807
00:35:13,034 --> 00:35:14,613
You could full tilt boogie
at the sanctuary.

808
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:15,931
I don't know if you did or not.

809
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:17,172
- Oh, I did.
- PROBST: Okay.

810
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:20,172
[laughter]

811
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:23,275
PROBST: So, Yam Yam,
what does it say about this game

812
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:26,655
when the better you do,
the bigger the target becomes?

813
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,854
YAM YAM: This is a game of
doing great things and knowing

814
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,103
how to smoke-and-mirror it,
you know?

815
00:35:31,206 --> 00:35:33,551
This is a very difficult game
to play, you know?

816
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:35,034
You want to be great,

817
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:37,241
but being great maybe is not
the best thing always.

818
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,206
- I'm not winning.
- [laughter]

819
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,896
I don't have to worry
about that, you know?

820
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,655
- But...
- PROBST: Jaime, Yam Yam said it really well.

821
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:49,724
That's why the great players
are great, is somehow,

822
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:52,275
they were great,
and they still got to the end,

823
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:54,275
and they still won
in many cases.

824
00:35:54,379 --> 00:35:56,724
JAIME: It is a balancing act.

825
00:35:56,827 --> 00:36:00,758
Another example is when somebody
finds an idol, like myself.

826
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:02,724
You automatically have

827
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,923
a giant target on your back.
And I just want to make it

828
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:07,137
extremely clear
to everyone, Jeff.

829
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:08,931
My idol walked out the door

830
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,793
at the last Tribal Council
with Kane.

831
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:21,172
So, I'm saying this again
so that there are no secrets.

832
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:24,344
I don't have the idol
any longer, sadly,

833
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,965
and now, I'm hoping
that everyone believes me.

834
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:29,613
PROBST:
Carolyn, here's another example.

835
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,785
Finding an idol, earning an
advantage really, really good.

836
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:34,103
- Yeah.
- PROBST: And then, suddenly, you're Jaime

837
00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:36,440
going, "I'm so sorry. I promise
I don't have it anymore."

838
00:36:36,482 --> 00:36:38,440
"You can check my bag.
I swear I didn't mean to...

839
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:40,586
I'm so...
Please don't vote me out."

840
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:42,344
- [laughter]
- Exactly.

841
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:44,172
CAROLYN:
It is such a balancing act.

842
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:46,395
I've been battling this
the whole time I've been here.

843
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:47,586
I don't want to be too loud,

844
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:48,716
but I don't...
I want to be relevant.

845
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:50,172
But you can't say anything,

846
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:51,793
but you got to trust people.

847
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:54,344
It's stressful. PROBST: Jaime,

848
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:55,862
you have eight people here,

849
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,931
eight different plans
to get to the end.

850
00:36:58,034 --> 00:36:59,586
And Frannie winning
some challenges

851
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:02,724
is one layer
to a reason you might think

852
00:37:02,827 --> 00:37:04,689
of voting somebody out.
There are all kinds

853
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:06,620
of things going on in this tribe

854
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,034
- that factor into the vote.
- JAIME: Yes.

855
00:37:09,137 --> 00:37:11,137
That's what I love
about this new era of Survivor

856
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:13,689
is it is new. Every single day,

857
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:15,689
it's a brand-new game.

858
00:37:15,793 --> 00:37:17,931
So, the people that
you worked with last Tribal,

859
00:37:18,034 --> 00:37:19,751
you might not talk to them
at all this Tribal.

860
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:21,103
It's always gonna be different

861
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:22,613
because everyone's motives
are different,

862
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:24,175
and depending
on what happens that day,

863
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,517
it might change
who you work with altogether.

864
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,068
So, the era of alliances...

865
00:37:29,172 --> 00:37:31,068
is over.

866
00:37:31,172 --> 00:37:32,517
PROBST: Danny,

867
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,793
what scares you most
about the game right now?

868
00:37:34,896 --> 00:37:37,517
DANNY: Uh, to be
honest, Jeff, we genuinely,

869
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,793
like, all really get along.

870
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:42,216
So now, like, it's no secret,
like, me and Lauren have been

871
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:43,793
on the opposite sides of voting.

872
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:45,896
But, like, on, like,
a personal level,

873
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,520
I love the hell out
of this-this woman.

874
00:37:47,586 --> 00:37:49,137
But it's also scary

875
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:51,061
because everybody else
has those relationships.

876
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,103
- LAUREN: Yeah.
- DANNY: And it could be,

877
00:37:53,206 --> 00:37:56,241
"Oh, now that friendship
has evolved into an alliance."

878
00:37:56,344 --> 00:37:58,793
PROBST: Frannie, you
were nodding in agreement.

879
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:00,751
Oh, yeah. I thought
one of the great certainties

880
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:02,344
in this game is that

881
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:03,889
Danny and Lauren didn't have
a strategic relationship.

882
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:06,586
- Yeah.
- You know? You can't sleep

883
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,482
on any permutation in this game.

884
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:09,827
- Wow.
- Right?

885
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:11,758
Anybody can talk to anyone
and be working

886
00:38:11,862 --> 00:38:13,586
with anyone at any time.

887
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:15,965
- It's crazy.
- [laughter]

888
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:18,344
You know?
You see everybody here laughing,

889
00:38:18,448 --> 00:38:21,172
- but everybody's, like, nervous.
- CAROLYN: Yeah.

890
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:23,310
This was my most stressful day,
and I had immunity.

891
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:25,103
I hear one plan,

892
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:26,992
and then someone else might
leave. Then the plan changes.

893
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:28,794
Then someone else leaves,
plan changes again.

894
00:38:28,896 --> 00:38:29,992
We add a person, plan changes.

895
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:31,862
So I would not be surprised

896
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:33,889
if we had about 20 different
plans going on today.

897
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:38,275
It is pure pandemonium,
like, legitimately.

898
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:42,103
Heidi, can a plan get detoured
with one comment?

899
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:46,103
Yes, especially when you have
so many uncertainties out there.

900
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:49,344
If you hear something that is,
like, high alert, like, "Okay,

901
00:38:49,448 --> 00:38:52,275
I'm not going with that plan.
I'm going with this other plan."

902
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:55,034
100%. There's so many plans.
None of us are solid.

903
00:38:55,137 --> 00:38:56,379
So I truly think,

904
00:38:56,482 --> 00:38:58,322
you say the wrong thing,
and you could go home.

905
00:38:59,862 --> 00:39:01,344
PROBST:
I feel like I have to ask

906
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:03,689
before we go to the vote,
are we good to vote?

907
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:07,000
Okay, in that case,

908
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:09,862
