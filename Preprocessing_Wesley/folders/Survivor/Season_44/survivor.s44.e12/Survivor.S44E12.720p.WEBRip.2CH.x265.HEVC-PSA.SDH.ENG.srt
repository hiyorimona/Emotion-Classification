She's checking the light

58
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:49,586
that it's bright enough to see,
and then,

59
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:51,206
she slowly gets up

60
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,379
and walks around and acts

00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:54,922
like she's gonna
go use the bathroom.

62
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:57,241
No, no, no, no.
She's looking for an idol.

63
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:00,896
Because Carolyn played an idol,

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,379
people assume
there's another idol out there.

65
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:04,896
I believe
there's an idol out there.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,448
And so, I immediately run over
to Carolyn, and I'm like,

67
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:10,000
"Carolyn, Heidi's looking.
We've got to go."

68

if they find an idol,

and I have not shared that
with anybody.

73
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:29,586
But even with the idol, I don't
feel completely comfortable.

74
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:32,896
I'm the last Soka member
alive in this game,

the easy vote next.

77
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,724
So, imagine if I had two idols.

78
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:41,137
I could buy two Tribal Councils
back-to-back,

79
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:42,827
and then I could position myself

like she doesn't know
what's going on,

or just, like, she plays
that role, like she's clueless.

she got some strategy going on.

00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:25,965
because I want Lauren to think
that I'm working with her 100%

337
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:27,344
when in reality, I'm not.

338
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:29,517
- I'm down with it.
- Me too.

339
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:32,517
YAM YAM: The fact
that Carolyn is a big threat

340
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,413
makes me very nervous.

341
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:37,344
We've been together the longest
out of anybody in this game.

342
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:39,862
And I love Carolyn, like,
with all my heart.

343
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:43,275
But now that we're only six,
you start, like,

344
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:45,344
thinking of how you can get
to the end,

345
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:47,620
and my gut tells me

346
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:49,379
it might be time
to vote Carolyn out.

347
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:50,862
I'm down.

348
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:55,413
♪ ♪

349
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,379
- CAROLYN: We're dragging.
- HEIDI: I know.

350
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:06,241
JAIME: The three losers...

351
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:08,172
We're coming back to camp, and

352
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,413
I'm thinking,
"There's only six people."

353
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:12,233
Tika... they're a threat
because they're three strong.

354
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:14,172
So, we have to break that up.

355
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:15,551
HEIDI: Only three of us.

356
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:17,413
This is what
it will feel like at the end.

357
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,896
JAIME: With Carolyn
here, it's perfect timing

358
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,900
to make that happen.

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,551
I think the three of us

360
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,482
should be thinking
about one of them.

361
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:27,820
Who are the biggest threats
left, what would you guys say?

362
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:29,724
- JAIME: Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I think...

363
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,475
- CAROLYN: For sure.
- If we want to hand him

364
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:34,068
a million dollars, then take him

365
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:35,647
- to the finals, period.
- HEIDI: Exactly. - CAROLYN: Yeah.

366
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:38,724
I know, Like, I love him.

367
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:40,758
HEIDI: Yeah.

368
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:43,896
JAIME: I am focused
on causing rifts in Tika.

369
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,310
That would be a huge feat

370
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:48,413
on my part to direct this game
in that manner.

371
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:50,103
I mean, that's literally...

372
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:52,061
Like, I'm not okay
with him winning, so my vote...

373
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:53,482
That's where my vote's going.

374
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,199
CAROLYN: Jaime started
talking about Carson,

375
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:57,551
and "we got to get Carson out."

376
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:01,517
And I do believe
that Carson is this big threat.

377
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,724
But I can't lose Carson yet.

378
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:07,620
I may be emotional,
but I'm not, like, dumb.

379
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,724
I still need my numbers.
I don't want

380
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:14,862
Lauren, Heidi
and Jaime to team up.

381
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:19,172
I know that Carson can't go to
the end with me, but we need him

382
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,655
for at least one more vote.

383
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:22,448
Oh, I hate saying that!

384
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:25,379
That's my baby.

385
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:37,862
I don't either. I'd rather
be you, Yam Yam and I.

386
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:39,862
- Me too.
- 'Cause I don't...

387
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,931
- I cannot trust Lauren and Jaime.
- Mm-hmm.

388
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:47,517
HEIDI: I lost my biggest ally,
Danny, but I'm still here, and

389
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,034
there's a couple of plans
out there.

390
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:52,827
For me, myself,
I think the final three should

391
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,965
probably be
Yam Yam, Carolyn and I.

392
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:57,517
But I don't trust anybody
right now.

393
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,103
Luckily, I have something
that could help me,

394
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:01,846
and that something's
an idol in my pocket.

395
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:05,482
I-I... That's my worry.

396
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:06,854
But I'm trying
to think logically,

397
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:08,034
but I do think that...

398
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:14,896
- Ah! Welcome!
- CARSON: Did you all

399
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,482
- get some rice in your bellies?
- Not yet.

400
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:20,931
Look at how beautiful
you all look.

401
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:22,482
Girl, we smell amazing.

402
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:26,205
Can you burp in my mouth?
In my nose?

403
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,655
- [Yam Yam burps] - Oh.
- [laughter]

404
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,620
YAM YAM: We walk into
camp, and Carolyn wants

405
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:34,793
to smell my burps
so she knew how the food smell.

406
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,344
That's out there,
that's a first.

407
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,551
I wanted to smell chocolate!

408
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,275
[burps]

409
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:43,620
She enjoyed that.

410
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:46,413
I felt kind of gross
after that, to be honest.

411
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,586
But he smelled good.
His beard, everything.

412
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:49,965
It's torturous.

413
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:52,682
Look, Jaime's been pitching you
all afternoon.

414
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:54,475
- Really?
- And obviously, everybody's like...

415
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:55,820
And I've just been saying,
"Oh, yeah,

416
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:57,379
it makes sense. It makes sense."

417
00:17:57,482 --> 00:18:00,068
CARSON:
They're trying to split us up.

418
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:01,758
- Me, Yam Yam and you.
- Yeah.

419
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:03,199
- They know that we're the power three right now.
- Yup.

420
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,482
CARSON: So hearing from Carolyn

421
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,068
that my name is out there

422
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,931
is scary, but I know that Lauren

423
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:11,344
and Jaime are just trying
to split

424
00:18:11,448 --> 00:18:13,310
the Tika Three up, and I'm like,

425
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:14,613
"It's very obvious
what you're doing."

426
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,000
So, it really comes down

427
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:18,689
to next vote. I... I...

428
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,689
CARSON: Luckily, right now,

429
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,206
Tikas remain strong,

430
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,448
and somehow,
we were able to masterfully

431
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:32,689
get to this point where
we are finally in the majority.

432
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:35,275
And so, now,
we can run this game.

433
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,620
Yes.

434
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:50,896
Right.

435
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:58,482
- Yes.
- And her crazy thing?

436
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:00,724
It is crazy, and I'm crazy, too.

437
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:02,413
- We're all a little crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

438
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,793
- But it works for her.
- Yes.

439
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:07,758
I am very surprised
that Yam Yam wants

440
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:10,034
to vote Carolyn out because

441
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:13,931
I'm looking at Carson as
my number one threat right now.

442
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,758
However,
I am going with the flow.

443
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:17,793
He wants to get Carolyn out

444
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:19,233
and paint the picture
of the target on her back?

445
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:21,310
Absolutely, yes, let's do it.

446
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:24,275
As long
as a Tika member goes home.

447
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:25,965
So you want
to get Carolyn, then?

448
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:27,620
That works for me.

449
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:29,716
- Mm-hmm.
- So the same plan as this morning, then?

450
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:32,034
I knew you guys were in
'cause I know

451
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,482
when you guys are lying to me.

452
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:37,896
Yeah.

453
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,360
And you know what?
I don't think...

454
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:41,413
- I haven't lied to you this whole time.
- Mm-hmm.

455
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:44,103
I really haven't. I never
wrote your name down, either.

456
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,655
I talked to Jaime about

457
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:49,655
how big of a target Carolyn is.

458
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:51,517
She definitely agrees with me.

459
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,379
So it might be time
that the Tika Three break up.

460
00:19:54,482 --> 00:19:55,965
It's very hard, but

461
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:57,931
I need to disconnect from them.

462
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:04,103
[laughs] I'd be...

463
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:09,586
When I got here

464
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:11,862
to Fiji,
I was just excited to play,

465
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:13,517
to live my dream.

466
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,827
But right now, it's not about

467
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:18,172
me being happy
that I'm here playing.

468
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:20,586
It's about me winning now.
I want to win.

469
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:29,130
If you think you have what
it takes to live in a jungle,

470
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:30,647
compete in challenges
and vote each other out,

471
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,000
apply to be on Survivor.

472
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:47,000
Come on in!

473
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:56,586
That is a beautiful sight.

474
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,068
Six people still in this game.

475
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:01,000
[laughs]

476
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,896
All right.

477
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,206
Shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

478
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,682
- [all voicing assent]
- All right, first things first.

479
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:15,103
- Yam Yam, got to take it back.
- Oh, Jeff.

480
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:16,724
It's like taking an arm off.

481
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:19,206
[laughing]

482
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:24,310
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

483
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:26,655
For today's challenge,
very simple.

484
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:28,137
You're gonna use two ropes

485
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:30,344
to balance a ball on a disc.

486
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:33,103
At regular intervals,
you will move farther back,

487
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:34,896
making it more difficult.

488
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,172
If at any point
your ball drops...

489
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,620
you're out.

490
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:41,241
Last person left standing

491
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:43,793
wins immunity, guaranteed a spot

492
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:45,793
- in the final five.
- LAUREN: Wow.

493
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:48,068
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- [cheering]

494
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:51,413
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be

495
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:53,655
- the 13th person voted out, become.
- Thirteen.

496
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:55,793
The sixth member of our jury.

497
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:57,896
- Shall we draw for spots?
- Yes. - YAM YAM: Yeah.

498
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,793
Let's do it.

499
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:12,482
All right, everybody looks good.

500
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:14,448
And this challenge...

501
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:16,275
is on.

502
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:21,758
You'll be in this section...

503
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:24,275
for five minutes.

504
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:28,724
Two ropes, one ball, one disc.

505
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:34,413
Little bit of movement
by Lauren. Nice recovery.

506
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:37,310
You want tiny movements.

507
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:41,931
Jaime drops.

508
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:43,931
Jaime's first out
of this challenge.

509
00:22:44,034 --> 00:22:45,655
No shot at immunity.

510
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:47,206
- Ugh!
- Carolyn drops

511
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,000
right behind Jaime.

512
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:52,689
We are down to four.

513
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:55,689
Still have three minutes left
in this section.

514
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,827
Carson, little bit of movement
and a nice save.

515
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:04,413
Can he do it again?
No. Carson is out.

516
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,965
We're down to three,
just like that.

517
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:09,965
Wow.
Fatigue of 23 days is showing.

518
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:12,965
We're down to Lauren,

519
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:15,068
Heidi and Yam Yam.

520
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:20,413
Lauren,
another little adjustment.

521
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,068
When you're dealing
with a ball on a disc,

522
00:23:24,172 --> 00:23:26,275
it is all about touch.

523
00:23:27,758 --> 00:23:29,724
Sometimes,
you need a light touch,

524
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:32,275
sometimes, more firm.

525
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,103
Yam Yam has no touch at all.

526
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,000
Yam Yam's out,
and we're down to two.

527
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:43,517
Lauren and Heidi
fighting for immunity.

528
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,000
You walk out of here
with this necklace,

529
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:47,517
you will make the final five.

530
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,000
You will be safe tonight
at Tribal.

531
00:23:51,689 --> 00:23:53,931
PROBST:
Ten seconds left in this round.

532
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,827
Five, four,

533
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:03,034
three, two, one.

534
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:05,655
You're both good.
You can let your ball drop.

535
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:08,068
- You're moving on. Nice job.
- Good job, Heidi.

536
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:10,620
- You, too.
- PROBST: All right, let's reset,

537
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:12,172
and we'll continue on.

538
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:15,206
♪ ♪

539
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:23,275
We are reset now
in the second section.

540
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,689
This challenge is back on.

541
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:29,758
Only two remain:
Lauren and Heidi.

542
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,689
That is how you do it.
Rock steady.

543
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:42,379
You never know
when it's your name

544
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,724
that's being tossed around.

545
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:47,379
This is how
you stop that conversation.

546
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:52,000
By walking back to camp
with that necklace.

547
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:55,448
You have the jewelry. Find some
other fool. It's not me tonight.

548
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,758
Little bit of movement
by Lauren.

549
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:11,206
Wow. Nice.

550
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,758
Lauren, another nice save.

551
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:18,862
Keep staying engaged.

552
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:22,068
Do not drift.

553
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:28,758
Heidi with a nice save.

554
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,034
- Ugh!
- Heidi cannot recover.

555
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,578
- It's over. Lauren wins.
- [Lauren yells]

556
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,413
individual immunity.

557
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:37,344
Safe tonight at Tribal Council.
Cannot be voted out

558
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:40,344
- of this game. Nice job.
- CARSON: Good job, Lauren.

559
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:41,793
JAIME: Amazing, Lauren.

560
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:43,620
Ugh.

561
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:44,965
Good job, ladies.

562
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:47,517
Good job. Can we do it again?

563
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,034
[laughing]

564
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:53,275
Lauren, come on over.

565
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:54,854
- YAM YAM: Good job, Lauren.
- For the second time

566
00:25:54,896 --> 00:25:58,862
this season,
individual immunity is yours.

567
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:00,344
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

568
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:03,137
PROBST: As for the rest of you,

569
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:05,275
Tribal Council tonight,
13th person

570
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:07,219
voted out, become
the sixth member of our jury.

571
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,206
- You know what?
- What?

572
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,827
- PROBST: It won't be you.
- Yeah.

573
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:12,413
- Congrats.
- Yeah.

574
00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:14,302
All right. Head back to camp.
See you tonight at Tribal.

575
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:15,862
Thank you.

576
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:18,448
This is my second immunity win.

577
00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:20,551
I am guaranteed a spot

578
00:26:20,655 --> 00:26:24,206
in the final five,
which is amazing.

579
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,758
So, heading back to camp,
I am thinking

580
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:31,034
about what my next move is so I
can make it to the final three.

581
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:39,655
[hammering]

582
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:52,689
YAM YAM: We have this
long afternoon of deciding

583
00:26:52,793 --> 00:26:54,379
what we're gonna
do tonight at Tribal,

584
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:57,344
but in my mind,
Carolyn is the biggest threat.

585
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,862
I just have to cement that plan.

586
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:02,931
But nobody's talking.
Everybody's sitting down

587
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:05,241
at camp, and nobody's moving.

588
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,034
Nobody wants to stand up

589
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:08,613
and go to the water well,
nobody wants

590
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:10,034
to go to the beach to wash up.

591
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:12,034
Do you forget
we have Tribal Council?

592
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:14,095
HEIDI: I'm gonna wash
off soon. I feel disgusting.

593
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:16,413
YAM YAM: We need to talk,
we need to talk about who's

594
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:17,896
gonna leave tonight.

595
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:25,827
Every...

596
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:29,379
I agree. Like, what the hell?

597
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:34,655
Mm-hmm.

598
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,206
And I believe... I-I mean, that.

599
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,344
HEIDI: If I go strong
with the Tika members...

600
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:44,448
Yam Yam, Carolyn,

601
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:47,344
Carson and I...
So four votes against Jaime...

602
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:49,103
I could possibly save my idol.

603
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:50,448
But everyone has lied

604
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:53,172
in this game to me
in some capacity.

605
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:57,482
So, do I trust what I've been
told or do I trust nobody

606
00:27:57,586 --> 00:28:00,482
and just use my idol
to save myself tonight?

607
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,620
Hell yeah. We have to.

608
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah, so, wait. Okay...

609
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,620
I just told her. I said,

610
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:16,484
"What do you,
like, do you want to do Jaime?"

611
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:21,482
So, what's
your best, like, plan?

612
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:22,965
Or, like, what do you think?

613
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,578
HEIDI: Well, those girls
have written my name,

614
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,862
so I will be very happy
to write Jaime's name.

615
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:30,275
Okay, so all four of us
on Jaime.

616
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:31,379
Everyone cool with that?

617
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:32,647
- YAM YAM: Yes.
- CARSON: Okay.

618
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:33,613
- Lock it down. Okay.
- HEIDI: Yeah.

619
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:35,551
We're not worried about an idol?

620
00:28:35,655 --> 00:28:37,413
Jaime doesn't have anything.

621
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:39,551
CAROLYN:
I can't trust Jaime and Lauren.

622
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:41,172
We need one of them gone.

623
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:44,068
Lauren won immunity.
So tonight, we're voting

624
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:45,862
for Jaime.

625
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:47,482
- This is real.
- For real.

626
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:49,206
CAROLYN:
I don't think Jaime has an idol,

627
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,241
but if she does have an idol,

628
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:52,889
I do think she's
comfortable enough right now

629
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,206
where she wouldn't play it.

630
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,931
JAIME: Is everyone in
agreement that Carolyn

631
00:28:58,034 --> 00:28:59,620
is the absolute threat
right now?

632
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:03,034
I mean, my worry with her
is that I don't trust

633
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:05,448
that Carolyn's
gonna bring me to the end.

634
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:07,206
So I would vote Carolyn.

635
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:10,379
Let's see what
Yam Yam says right now.

636
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,862
- But that-that's my gut, too.
- Yeah.

637
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:14,724
JAIME: I don't have an idol
anymore, so

638
00:29:14,827 --> 00:29:17,586
it is nerve-racking depending on.

639
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,068
Yam Yam and Carson

640
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:21,689
to be okay
with turning against Carolyn.

641
00:29:25,275 --> 00:29:27,379
Carolyn is more dangerous
than Carson.

642
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:29,413
Yeah.

643
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,620
I'm down.

644
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:33,451
Right.

645
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:34,862
She's coming.

646
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:36,448
Uh-huh.

647
00:29:36,551 --> 00:29:40,206
To Carolyn, this vote
will feel like a betrayal.

648
00:29:41,275 --> 00:29:43,724
She's done it to me before,
I've done it to her,

649
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:45,406
but we've never done
it against each other.

650
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:46,406
- LAUREN: You okay?
- What happened?

651
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:48,103
People are obviously talking.

652
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:49,862
I don't know
what you guys are saying.

653
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:50,965
We all doing Heidi?

654
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:53,172
- Right.
- Yeah.

655
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:55,758
YAM YAM: This is the most
difficult vote for me tonight,

656
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:59,620
not only because
I'm drawing my path to the end,

657
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:02,689
but also because I might
have to betray my biggest ally.

658
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,095
You were, like,
honestly saying, like,

659
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:11,337
Carolyn, me and you at the end?

660
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:12,724
- I really was.
- Okay.

661
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:14,206
I mean, I-I could...

662
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,164
if you want to do something
different, I'm... I've...

663
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:18,820
- You've always been my number-number one, you know?
- Yeah. Same here.

664
00:30:18,862 --> 00:30:20,931
CARSON: So, do you really
want to get Carolyn out?

665
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:22,275
I think Carolyn can win.

666
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:24,896
Okay.

667
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,206
And you don't think we can
get her out at five? Okay.

668
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,950
I don't think
we can take her out at five,

669
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:31,068
and I think she'll win
the fire-making.

670
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:34,620
She practiced fire
until she was bleeding.

671
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:36,379
Think about it.

672
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:39,310
CARSON: Yam Yam
wants to take out Carolyn.

673
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:41,068
I'm so surprised.

674
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,068
Are we going to target Carolyn?

675
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:46,310
I mean, Carolyn
has played a great game.

676
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,551
I've consistently
underestimated her,

677
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:52,344
and I think everyone else
has underestimated her, too.

678
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:54,241
Carolyn could win this game.

679
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:56,137
You have to trust your gut.

680
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:57,785
I don't know what
your gut is telling you.

681
00:30:57,827 --> 00:30:59,655

683
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,896
but I want to do this together.

684
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,931
Okay.

685
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:09,310
But at the same time,
Carolyn's a loyal player,

686
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,862
and I like loyalty,
especially if it's to me.

687
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:14,103
We've been together
this whole game,

688
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,620
and so
it's a difficult decision.

689
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:18,137
Who do I take out at this point?

690
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:21,241
I'm not sure. It could be Jaime
or it could be Carolyn.

691
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,551

It's exciting to play this game.

696
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:37,034
It's exciting to live my dream.

697
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:40,655
But right now,
living my dream means...

698
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:43,485
...cutting the dream
of someone I love.

699
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:46,310
I got a lot of love for Carolyn,

700
00:31:46,413 --> 00:31:48,293
the way we connected
at Tika the first few days.

701
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:52,275
I have a big conflict in my head

702
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:54,103
of getting rid
of Carolyn or Jaime.

703
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:55,965
The number one reason
to get rid of Jaime

704
00:31:56,068 --> 00:31:57,965
is that throughout this game,
Jaime has cemented

705
00:31:58,068 --> 00:32:00,275
a lot of relationships
and she's a big threat.

706
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:02,862
So it might be better just
to get rid of Jaime tonight.

707
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,379
But I know
I have a better chance

708
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:06,482
without Carolyn
at the final three.

709
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:08,551
I think out of everybody here,

710
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:10,896
the best game
is being played by Carolyn.

711
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,310
My brain is telling me
I need to take Carolyn out.

712
00:32:13,413 --> 00:32:15,379
My heart
doesn't want me to do it.

713
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:18,482
So the question
for me tonight is

714
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,931
do I have the courage
to take Carolyn out?

715
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:22,896
Am I gonna be able...
strong enough to do this?

716
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,482
I don't know. I don't know.

717
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:30,310
I want this money and I want
this title, but it's hard.

718
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,862

one immunity win,
on the right day,

748
00:33:59,482 --> 00:34:00,931
can change the entire game.

749
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:03,896
Yeah. Especially when
there's only six people left,

750
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,275
and there's idols
potentially at play.

751

discussing that?

We've anticipated advantages

the possibility
of an idol being played.

763
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,061
It's impossible not to think
of that, and it's very scary

that one person
can decide what happens,

765
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:42,793

five more people don't matter.

we are, in some ways,
working together

792
00:35:43,551 --> 00:35:46,827

it is a little bit more jumbled.

793
00:35:46,931 --> 00:35:49,310
Sometimes you're
working with a group,

794
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,172
and then the day of Tribal,

795
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:54,482
they break up, and
that could be the case tonight.

796
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:58,482

799

that we're gonna
be coming down to five.

of it is pure strategy?

816
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:52,034
Here's how I think.

817
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:53,457
I think that
there's nothing wrong

818
00:36:53,517 --> 00:36:54,509
with being an emotional player.

819
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:56,482
And I think that everybody here

820
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:57,931
can attest
to the fact that I have

821
00:36:58,034 --> 00:36:59,758
been extremely emotional.

822
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:02,965
But it doesn't mean
that somebody can't be

823
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:05,655
strategic who's emotional.
I am both.

824
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:09,517
But I have promised myself...
I've promised my son...

825
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,517
That I'm not
gonna apologize for crying.

826
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,758
And when certain people
in this game lie to you,

827
00:37:15,862 --> 00:37:17,344
it's a big blow. It hurts.

828
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:20,689
So I'm not gonna ever deny that.

829
00:37:20,793 --> 00:37:22,586
It doesn't mean
I can't play this game.
