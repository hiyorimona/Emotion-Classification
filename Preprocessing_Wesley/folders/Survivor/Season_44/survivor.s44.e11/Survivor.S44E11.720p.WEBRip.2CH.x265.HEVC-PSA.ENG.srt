1
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:10,586
Seriously, both of you guys.

2
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:12,482
You knew I was paranoid all day.

3
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:16,482
You did it all day.

4
00:00:27,344 --> 00:00:28,655
Once.

5
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:30,034
We get back to camp.

6
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:31,475
I say, "Carolyn,
I need to talk to you."

7
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:32,896
"Carolyn, I need to talk to you.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,923
"Carolyn, we need to sit down,
and we need to talk

9
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,337
about Tribal Council."
Because the two people

10
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,475
that she trusts the most...
Carson and I...

11
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:40,310
Left Carolyn out of the vote.

12
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:42,896
Frannie.
That's three votes Frannie.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,655
Frannie was such a juicy target.

14
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:46,655
It was impossible
not to vote her out.

15
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:48,310
I could not resist.

16
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:50,310
Frannie, the tribe was spoken.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,068
I knew leaving Carolyn
out of this vote was gonna be

18
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:58,448
bad, and it backfired.

19
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:00,689
- Right.
- There's nobody here. Like...

20
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:05,655
No, there's not.
At every... vote.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,820
- And I could. And I could.
- Once. That was once, man.

22
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:10,862
This is the first time for...

23
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:12,845
- Yam Yam, you were over that.
- I'm...

24
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:14,793
This just happened, man.

25
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:18,751
I feel bad for Yam Yam and
Carson. She's, like, yelling.

26
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:21,758
I just think
she needs some time.

27
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,275
Dude...

28
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,586
- I'm sorry. Like, just stop.
- Yeah. It...

29
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,551
I don't play.

30
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,827
Let 'em. Go bond with them.
Like, I-I... It's...

31
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,378
Sorry. You guys know what
you were... doing to me.

32
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:44,310
To find people that you actually
trust and then they betray you?

33
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:47,620
It's torture.
It is. It's mental torture.

34
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:49,378
I didn't expect this
from you two, okay?

35
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:50,965
- Yeah.
- Like, God.

36
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:53,033
Yeah, it's... I'm so sorry.

37
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:55,378
They're just
telling me what I want to hear

38
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,206
so I'll vote
with them the next vote.

39
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,689
Do they actually care?
Probably not.

40
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:01,482
I should just be able to, like,

41
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:04,965
turn the page and be okay
with it, but I can't.

42
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:07,896
I don't know what to say.
I just need a break.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,965
I think she thought
she had the perfect game.

44
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,586
- Yeah.
- She was right on every vote so far.

45
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:15,310
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46
00:02:16,655 --> 00:02:19,068
Exactly.

47
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,275
No.

48
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,779
It really wasn't
either of you guys?

49
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:23,785
- It was not me.
- It wasn't me, I swear.

50
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:26,000
My vote was big "F"

51
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,965
- and a dotted "I."
- Mine was a little "E" at the end.

52
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:30,889
I got one vote. I
didn't foresee that coming.

53
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,344
So, I want

54
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:33,751
to figure out
who put a name on me.

55
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:35,025
Who has a motive
to put a name on me?

56
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,034
I feel like it was Frannie.

57
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:39,658
To this point,

58
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:42,206
I have Heidi, and right now,

59
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,067
she's the only thing
I trust in this game.

60
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:46,413
Yam Yam? Well...

61
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:47,820
I don't-I don't...
You know me. I don't...

62
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:49,302
I don't take it personally
whatsoever.

63
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:51,000
Ay. It was me.

64
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:53,930
I put Danny's name down, but

65
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,206
I never
in a million years thought

66
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,758
Danny would still be here.

67
00:02:57,862 --> 00:03:00,275
So, I am gonna lie my way
out of this one

68
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,034
because he's my closest ally,
and I got two votes

69
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:06,551
at Tribal Council that
I did not see coming at all.

70
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:18,000
Luckily, I still have my idol,

71
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:20,827
so I have to somehow
come up with a plan

72
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:22,751
on how to get out of here
and not be at the bottom

73
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:24,724
of the totem pole
for the next one.

74
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,862
Inhale.

75
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:37,655
Finding that total relaxation
and peace.

76
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,379
Exhale.

77
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:42,413
If you guys are comfortable,

78
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:45,827
we want to share our gratitude

79
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,827
and use this energy
to amplify it.

80
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,930
Every night, I try to thank

81
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:53,586
the universe or spirit,
whatever higher power, like,

82
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:56,310
my ability to see, hear,
speak, breathe, run, jump,

83
00:03:56,413 --> 00:04:00,000
things, like, I take
for granted sometimes, so...

84
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:02,068
So it was super emotional
after Tribal.

85
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:04,344
And this game is
really emotional, but

86
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:06,137
we really are a family out here,

87
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:09,586
and we are creating real bonds.

88
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:10,965
I just really appreciate y'all

89
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,475
and your stories
and sharing them with me.

90
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:14,275
Because we can all come together

91
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,930
and meditate together
and have this really

92
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:19,241
high-vibe experience,
it does give permission

93
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:21,862
for us to be super cutthroat.

94
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:23,379
We are all
cheering each other on,

95
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:25,896
but battling toe-to-toe
at the same time.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,379
Being here and dealing

97
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,958
with all the emotions
that we deal with...

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,310
We have lows, we have highs...

99
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:33,965
But I feel growth.
I feel growth every day

100
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:37,172
from a young age or even
when we started day one,

101
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:39,613
and I hope that we can utilize
it to be a better human being

102
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,758
outside of this game.

103
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:44,655
Mm. - We have lows, we have Heidis.

104
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:46,206
I think all of us

105
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,137
have gone through some struggles
in our lives.

106
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:51,344
I moved to this country
from Puerto Rico,

107
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:53,758
barely speaking any English.
I mean, I had nothing.

108
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:55,689
I don't have family.
I didn't have friends.

109
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:57,793
So I had a lot of struggles.

110
00:04:57,896 --> 00:05:00,517
Sometimes you get stripped
of everything,

111
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,620
and then you find
within yourself your strength.

112
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:06,000
Just likeSurvivor.

113
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:08,233
I have to work really hard
to finish my college degree,

114
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,172
and now,
I am an electrical engineer.

115
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:12,137
I have a good life.

116
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:15,241
I work,
I'm a mother, I'm married.

117
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:16,827
It's all a dream,
and it's coming true

118
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:18,551
because
I just go the extra mile.

119
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:22,448
And in this game, if I have
to go the extra mile, I will.

120
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm willing to take some risks

121
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:26,172
in order
to be the Sole Survivor.

122
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:29,379
Oh, I know...
I know, like, I can't, like,

123
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:31,406
play the game, and then, like,
isolate from people,

124
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:33,268
- and, like, I just needed a minute.
- You played...

125
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,965
- Like, I need a minute.
- Carolyn,

126
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,551
you play the way
you want to play.

127
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,931
No, I know, but I'm saying,
like, I know in my head.

128
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:42,862
Can I see?

129
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:45,000
No. I can't do this.

130
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:47,724
Like, go away from people,
and, like...

131
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:49,275
I can't take it
sometimes, though.

132
00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:56,931
There's a difference
between playing the game

133
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:59,862
and, like, taking things
personally. I know that.

134
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:01,896
It just takes me
a little bit to figure it out.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,344
So even though

136
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:06,275
they betrayed me, like,
last vote, I'm over it.

137
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,275
I can go back, and I do trust
Carson and Yam Yam.

138
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,655
I need Tika to stay together.

139
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:16,551
Oh, and duh.

140
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:19,655
I have my idol
no one knows about.

141
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:23,517
So I feel good. I feel like
I am in a good position.

142
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:28,482
- I cannot wait...
- No, you're not in it.

143
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:31,275
- You're not in it.
- Oh, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

144
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:34,379
So, we've been doing,
I think, good together.

145
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:37,172
We came in here
with three people at 12,

146
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,793
and we're now down to seven,

147
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:40,751
- and so we still have all three of us.
- I know.

148
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:43,551
Maybe last vote
was a little bit crazy, but I think

149
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:45,827
- we're in a great position.
- It's all good.

150
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:48,026
After talking with
Carolyn, she's back on track.

151
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,068
And Tika is still going strong.

152
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,379
Yeah, we get in silly fights,

153
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:54,241
but we are
controlling the votes,

154
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,689
kind of pulling the strings, and

155
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:59,000
we are playing
a very under-the-radar game.

156
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:01,172
And by the way, we need
to make sure Danny knows

157
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,586
that Heidi was the one
who wrote his name down.

158
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,103
I feel like he knows.

159
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:09,172
At the last Tribal Council,
Heidi voted for Danny.

160
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,517
When she looked around,
nobody was there with her.

161
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:15,241
Someone voted on me,
and everybody's saying,

162
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:19,034
"No, it wasn't me."
Someone here is lying to me.

163
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:21,068
I'm always
using everybody's sloppiness

164
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:22,482
to my advantage.

165
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:24,310
Telling Danny
that Heidi voted for him

166
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,862
makes the possibility of the two
of them working together

167
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:28,724
against me harder.

168
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,931
Jaime or...

169
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:34,724
- No.
- Heidi?

170
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:36,172
Really?

171
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,896
No... Oh, that's wild.

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,275
Yeah, I didn't even think it.

173
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,896
I start trying
to dissect the logic.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,448
How can voting me

175
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,068
propel Heidi's game?
Because Heidi's

176
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,302
not gonna do anything illogical.

177
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,655
It doesn't make sense.

178
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:51,827
I'm Heidi's number one.
But you don't know

179
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:53,544
who's telling the truth
and who isn't at all.

180
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:55,371
We're gonna... we're gonna
get back on the same page

181
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:56,689
next Tribal?

182
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:59,482
It wasn't me.
Doesn't make sense, you know?

183
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:01,034
I don't... Yeah, I don't know.

184
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:03,413
- If-if it was you, I'm-I'm still...
- Yeah.

185
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,655
- Down to work, you know, together.
- Yeah.

186
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:07,716
It's-it's a game. You know,
I don't look-look at it.

187
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:11,137
Oh, God. I said,
"No, that wasn't me."

188
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,103
I'm lying left and right,
just digging

189
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:15,482
out the hole that I dug myself.

190
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:22,034
Yeah, I-I feel confused.

191
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:24,379
So, I-I... I'm pretty sure...

192
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:25,551
Could it be her?

193
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:27,724
Maybe. I think it was Yam Yam.

194
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:29,413
Don't say anything, though.

195
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:31,379
No, let-let's not
make a big deal of it.

196
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:34,000
- So, I... I think Yam Yam had this planned.
- Yeah.

197
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:36,413
I know Heidi
very well. I believe her

198
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,117
and that-that
she didn't turn against me.

199
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:40,309
I think Yam Yam and Tika

200
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:42,413
are trying to split me
and Heidi up, but

201
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:43,861
it's silly. I would

202
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:45,233
find it difficult
to find first graders

203
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,620
who would buy that story.

204
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:49,000
So, now I have
my sights set on Tika.

205
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,206
Ooh. Ooh!

206
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,310
What is that?

207
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,103
Isn't that a lobster?

208
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:09,620
That's the body.

209
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm not worthy.

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,931
I am, too. No.

211
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay. Uh, rock, paper, scissor.

212
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:18,482
Okay.

213
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:20,793
Rock, paper, scissors.

214
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:22,206
- You win.
- No!

215
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,206
- No, I feel like I don't deserve it.
- Take it.

216
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,103
I was gonna put it, like,
somehow in my hair.

217
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:29,793
So I found this lobster thing.
I love it.

218
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:31,241
And then, Yam Yam

219
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:33,586
found this one for me
at the beach.

220
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,206
Over there.

221
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,793
It's cool. It's different.

222
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:38,647
I'll never come across
something like this again.

223
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:39,724
I know I won't.

224
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:41,344
So this is, like, special to me,

225
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:45,241
and I needed to just, like, get
in the water 'cause, like,

226
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:47,655
I want to be, like,
one with the lobster.

227
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:49,793
And I'm doing it.

228
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:57,896
This is beachy.
Like, it's beautiful here.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,517
And it's just...
it's overwhelmingly amazing.

230
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,275
Like, it's...
there's nothing like this.

231
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:05,689
To see all these fish,
and, like, I got to be a mermaid

232
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:09,965
and, like, just be in the water
and have fun.

233
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,448
I can't do this game 24/7,
and that's how it is.

234
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,620
And I always feel better
with Yam Yam.

235
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:19,034
Us being like kids. Whoa!

236
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:20,965
I was singing
The Little Mermaid.

237
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,965
I was doing flips.

238
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:24,724
I was free.

239
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:27,586
Just made me happy
to not think about

240
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:30,103
all the chaos
that's going on here.

241
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:35,310
So...

242
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:38,586
So, who's your ideal, like,
three being at the end?

243
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,000
Can I be there three times?

244
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,758
I have multiple personalities.

245
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:45,655
I know you do.

246
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:49,862
Danny.

247
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:52,172
- And then I would say Lauren.
- Lauren.

248
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:54,199
- Lauren.
- The thing with Danny is,

249
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:57,551
any say... any name we say, he's
gonna vote with us right now.

250
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah.

251
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,758
We're... we are
in a position to prove...

252
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:06,793
- We're pretty much equal right now.
- Yeah.

253
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:09,103
Where keeping Tika around
has to be...

254
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:16,275
Yeah. Yeah.

255
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,586
I do agree with Danny.

256
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:18,992
I think that
the former Tika tribe...

257
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:20,931
Yam Yam, Carolyn

258
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:23,413
and Carson... is a threat.

259
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,448
They have been
running the show here.

260
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:29,758
- You. Both of you.
- I agree.

261
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:32,034
I just had to work with them
to just survive

262
00:11:32,137 --> 00:11:35,206
in this game, but now
they need to be split up.

263
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,551
The Tika Three...

264
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,172
They are not
breaking each other.

265
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:41,440
They are gonna
pick us off one by one.

266
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:42,862
- They want... Yes.
- Yeah.

267
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,379
It's an automatic, like,

268
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,344
- easy final three for them.
- So...

269
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,965
They are so...
they are super tight.

270
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:52,655
So I think it's either
Carson or Yam Yam.

271
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,068
Yeah.

272
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:01,337
I'm nervous working with Danny

273
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:03,275
and Heidi, but right now,

274
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:04,896
we are aligned, target-wise,

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and that's Yam Yam.

276
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:10,068
This makes sense for everybody.

277
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:11,475
- Yes. Yup.
- For the four of us.

278
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:13,277
- For the final of us.
- So, um, yeah.

279
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,206
Yam Yam has
played a brilliant game.

280
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,655
He's fantastic

281
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:18,896
socially with everyone.
Everyone loves Yam Yam.

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,827
But those three have

283
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:23,310
to be broken up.
That's the number one goal.

284
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:24,655
- So, you..
- It's gonna hurt

285
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:25,854
to write his name,
let's be honest.

286
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,000
It...

287
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:28,517
Uh, he... yes.

288
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,137
For me, 'cause he's so likable.

289
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:31,793
But that... This is the game.

290
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:33,233
- This is the game. I'm playing the game.
- Yes, and...

291
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:34,655
Yeah.

292
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:36,655
That'sSurvivor 101.

293
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,586
It's not personal.
It's strictly business.

294
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:40,827
Gameplay is gameplay.
Friendship is friendship.

295
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:43,827
There is no winning this game

296
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,241
without being aggressive,
especially now, down to seven.

297
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:48,655
Like, you better start
taking everything by the reins.

298
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,302
It's a 12-round
fight. I would say

299
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:57,275
we're in the ninth round,
and it's a doozy.

300
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,689
There's a lot of right hand,
right or left hand,

301
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:01,103
swinging, ducks, stiffs.

302
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:02,689
Everybody's been
knocked down once.

303
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:04,854
Everybody's got votes on them,
everybody's been punched

304
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:06,413
in the face. It's up in the air.

305
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:08,448
This is a barn burner, but

306
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:10,448
I'm playing hard,
and I'm trying to win.

307
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:13,103
I didn't come here to take part.
I came here to take over.

308
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:18,965
Final seven, season 44.

309
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,758
If you want this, you got
to apply to be on Survivor.

310
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,586
Welcome.

311
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:04,068
Yam Yam,
you know this challenge?

312
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:05,482
Of course I know that challenge.

313
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:08,413
I don't think
it's gonna be a fun one.

314
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:10,310
It looks like torture chamber.
I remember.

315
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:13,413
Ozzy going
with the little snorkel thing.

316
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:15,931
I have fat hands. I don't know
how my snorkel is gonna work.

317
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:17,344
You know?
Maybe not a lot of air.

318
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:20,068
- We'll find out. Shall we get to it?
- Yeah.

319
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:22,931
First things first. Let me
take back the necklace, Carson.

320
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:25,034
Thank you.

321
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:29,344
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

322
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:32,413
Today's challenge
is a Survivorclassic

323
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,862
built to test

324
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:38,517
your ability to overcome fear.
Here's how it works.

325
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,172
For today's challenge,
you're gonna be in the water

326
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:43,758
underneath
a grated steel barrier.

327
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:45,793
As the tide rises,

328
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:48,172
your breathing room
will decrease.

329
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:51,517
That's when
the panic will set in.

330
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,517
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

331
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,379
guaranteed a spot
in the final six.

332
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,758
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be

333
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,517
the twelfth person voted out,

334
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,020
become the fifth member
of our jury.

335
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,689
- Shall we draw for spots?
- Yes.

336
00:15:04,793 --> 00:15:06,827
Let's do it.

337
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,206
All right, everybody ready
to officially begin?

338
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:21,172
This challenge...

339
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:22,517
is on.

340
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,275
And now we settle in.

341
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:35,586
- Really?
- Yup.

342
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,413
You're all looking great.

343
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:43,137
There's no panic yet,

344
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:47,482
but that tide
is gonna slowly rise,

345
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:51,068
and that breathing room
will decrease.

346
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:53,482
And that's where
you have to manage that panic,

347
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,448
'cause the panic will come.

348
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:57,241
Got plenty
of breathing room now.

349
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:59,413
We could have a nice, long chat.

350
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:02,758
- This...
- Yam Yam,

351
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,620
how you doing down there?

352
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,310
I'm chilling. It's like

353
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:09,103
being back in Puerto Rico.
I'm trying to sunbathe,

354
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:11,931
get a little warm, not get
too cold, not get too anxious.

355
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:13,931
Getting used
to these little bars.

356
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:15,586
They're becoming my friends.

357
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:18,034
I'm trying to connect with them.

358
00:16:18,137 --> 00:16:20,310
I hope it works
when that time comes.

359
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:25,896
Lauren, 21 days into this game.

360
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,793
Are you surprised
you're still here?

361
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:36,931
- Really?
- I'm, like...

362
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,275
Are you panicking now
or are you okay at this moment?

363
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,965
I'm okay at this moment, but...

364
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,448
You've been here 30 minutes.

365
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,655
Now you're gonna
start to feel it.

366
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:06,137
One of the worst parts
of this challenge is

367
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:09,378
how slowly the tide rises.

368
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:13,896
You can feel it working its way
up the side of your face.

369
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:18,103
But this is how
you get to day 21,

370
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,723
by this kind of performance.
And how you get to day 22

371
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:24,137
is by winning this challenge.

372
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:34,793
Lauren can't take any more.

373
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:37,448
Lauren is the first to drop out.

374
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:39,724
Nice effort. Lauren lasted

375
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,310
- an hour...
- Good job, Lauren.

376
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:43,689
...doing something

377
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:45,758
that you are
very uncomfortable doing.

378
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:48,793
We are down to six.

379
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:52,827
Everybody now with their face
through the grate.

380
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:55,689
Different strategies
for how you do it.

381
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:59,931
Some people using the snorkel.

382
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:02,448
Carolyn plugging the nose.

383
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:06,034
Yam Yam fighting to stay in it,
body kicking.

384
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:08,931
This is where
you really have to start

385
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:12,448
overcoming that fear
that's gonna kick in.

386
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:19,034
Jaime pops up.

387
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:20,793
Cannot take it anymore.

388
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:23,413
We are down to five.

389
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:26,137
That's that panic,

390
00:18:26,241 --> 00:18:28,034
and it is not fun.

391
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:32,344
Tide continues to rise.

392
00:18:32,448 --> 00:18:36,000
This is a great test
of controlling your thoughts,

393
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:40,448
the thoughts that make you feel
that sense of panic.

394
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:45,551
Carson is gonna duck out.

395
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:47,379
And we are down to four.

396
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:48,965
Nice job, Carson.

397
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,310
It is Heidi,

398
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:54,448
Danny, Carolyn and Yam Yam

399
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,724
still fighting
in this challenge.

400
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:01,620
A little bit of a swell
puts Danny fully under water

401
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,965
for a moment.

402
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:05,517
Heidi fully under.

403
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,793
Carolyn is under.

404
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,310
Everybody fighting right now.

405
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,413
Carolyn is under.

406
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:15,000
Will she come back up?

407
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:18,034
No, Carolyn is out.
Great job, Carolyn.

408
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:21,310
- Yeah.
- We are down to three.

409
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,655
That tide is
really up there now.

410
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,862
Danny fully under now.
Fully under.

411
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,862
This is a test,
and it's a tough one.

412
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:44,137
Danny's body twisting
all over the place,

413
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:46,896
trying to find some relief,
some escape.

414
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:50,896
Danny fighting,
fighting, fighting.

415
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,586
Danny's up. Danny's out.

416
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:55,103
And we have Heidi on one end,

417
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:58,655
Yam Yam on the other
in a Survivorshowdown.

418
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,206
Here we go.

419
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:08,275
It will be Heidi or Yam Yam

420
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:09,793
wearing the necklace

421
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:13,000
for the first time this season.

422
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:15,482
This is a great effort.

423
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,827
Keep digging!

424
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:21,172
Keep digging! Don't you quit!

425
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,620
Been in there
an hour, 25 minutes.

426
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,965
This is absolutely

427
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:31,931
miserable right now.

428
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:33,758
Every time

429
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:36,172
you try to get a breath,
that water

430
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,551
tries to sneak in.

431
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:42,000
And all you want
to do is just quit.

432
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:53,482
- Heidi, is out. It's over. Yam Yam!
- Yam Yam!

433
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,448
It's over.

434
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,103
- Yam Yam cannot hear me.
- Yam Yam!

435
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:59,137
- Yam Yam!
- Heidi, great effort.

436
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:02,827
- Yam Yam has won individual immunity.
- Yam Yam, you won!

437
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:08,103
- You won, Yam Yam! You won!
- Yam Yam.

438
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,724
Yam Yam wins

439
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:14,448
individual immunity.

440
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:16,758
- Congratulations.
- You did it!

441
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:18,413
What an effort.

442
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:21,586
What a showdown
between Heidi and Yam Yam.

443
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,551
Yam Yam, get over here.

444
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:28,379
- Right here.
- Yeah, yeah.

445
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:34,068
Oh, my God.

446
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:38,206
Good job, brother. Good job.

447
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,620
Oh.

448
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:42,517
Open up here.

449
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:47,000
You earned this.

450
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:50,551
There is no denying you overcame

451
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:53,517
a lot of panic and fear
out there, outlasted

452
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,517
all of these competitors.

453
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,379
What's the emotion?

454
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,655
All right, you're safe.

455
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:22,034
You are guaranteed a spot
in the final six.

456
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:25,862
For the rest of you,
after 21 tough days,

457
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:28,310
somebody will be
voted out tonight,

458
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,302
twelfth person, and become
the fifth member of our jury.

459
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:32,233
You have the afternoon to
figure out who it's gonna be.

460
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:34,413
All right, swim out.
See you tonight at Tribal.

461
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:35,758
Go for it.

462
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,793
You know whose name

463
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,379
is not gonna be written down?

464
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:47,379
"Yam Yam" is not gonna
be written down tonight.

465
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:48,931
Makes me feel like a Badass,

466
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,758
like I can do anything,
I'm powerful.

467
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:55,482
And for Tika,
tonight's vote is huge.

468
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:59,068
If we survive this vote,
we have the numbers

469
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:01,689
to take everybody out,
and it's us to the end.

470
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,241
I am excited for us...
You, me and Yam Yam...

471
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:16,862
Because I feel
like we're so close.

472
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:20,793
This is the most critical vote
because there's seven left.

473
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:23,586
Three are Tika,
the rest are other people.

474
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:25,009
We just have
to get it down to six

475
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:26,896
for Tika to have the majority.

476
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:30,310
He-he will. He will.

477
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:32,241
Okay.

478
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:35,793
Yeah.

479
00:23:35,896 --> 00:23:37,655
Exactly.

480
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:39,268
Yam Yam winning
the immunity didn't go my way.

481
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,965
It's beautiful.

482
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:43,793
Good on him, but
let's get back to game planning.

483
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:45,682
We're putting the votes on
Carson. He's in the Tika Three.

484
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,275
He's got to go home.

485
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:49,310
I don't want to go
to the final two with Carson.

486
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:51,620
If I... if I cloned myself,
and I saw me up there

487
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:53,793
against Carson,
I might vote for Carson.

488
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:55,164
When they ask me,
I'm gonna tell them

489
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:56,475
that I'm voting one of you guys.

490
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:58,344
- Yeah.
- Okay.

491
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,793
We'll split... we'll do...

492
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:06,862
We'll do three-three on Jaime,
two on Lauren.

493
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:08,613
Everybody who's not in on
the plan, you have to have a lie

494
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,000
'cause tonight's the last night
to play Shot in the Dark.

495
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:12,613
If somebody plays
Shot in the Dark tonight,

496
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,544
a lot of people messed up
because this should be,

497
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,758
hopefully,
a complete blindside on Carson.

498
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:18,413
You and Heidi vote for Lauren.

499
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,037
We're all gonna do Jaime.
Is that cool?

500
00:24:20,103 --> 00:24:21,931
Are you...?
Is that the for-real plan,

501
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:23,406
- or is this the fake one?
- That's-that's the real plan.

502
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:24,793
If you guys are cool with that.

503
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,448
I'm cool with that.

504
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:28,311
My strategy
is keep the numbers down

505
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,793
of the other people
that are not Tika.

506
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:32,137
People that I need out

507
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:33,896
are obviously
Lauren and Jaime because

508
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,896
I don't need them
with me at the end.

509
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,682
I don't think they're gonna see
this coming.

510
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:40,586
- Oh, no, no, no.
- But be ready when we come back.

511
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,344
Carolyn's gonna be crying.

512
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:43,958
Right now, we
are all voting for Carson.

513
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,827
If the plan works out,

514
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,413
Carolyn could be a...
a cannonball

515
00:24:48,517 --> 00:24:50,379
when we come back.

516
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:52,034
Just open!

517
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:53,440
Usually, I go like this,
and then, it's...

518
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, there it is. Got it.

519
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:00,475
That's the worst
I've ever tried in my life.

520
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:02,137
I don't look forward to that,

521
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:04,620
but right now,
the biggest threat is Carson.

522
00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:06,137
And I've been getting

523
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:08,793
my name written
in the last two Tribal Councils,

524
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:10,689
so I just got to make sure
that it's not me.

525
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:13,068
And I do have an idol
in my pocket that could save me.

526
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:14,275
So, you kind of have to be

527
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,103
ready for...
for any-any surprises.

528
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:19,068
I'm just worried.

529
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:21,620
I get the vibe
that they're voting for Carson.

530
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,137
Oh. I feel like
they're gonna vote... vote him.

531
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:30,551
Something's not right, and
there's nothing more annoying

532
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,482
when you're told by Danny,

533
00:25:32,586 --> 00:25:34,466
"Yeah, that's a plan.
Let's just keep it simple.

534
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:36,758
Let's just not even have
any more discussions."

535
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:40,034
I'm worried now
that Danny is planning

536
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:41,551
to take Carson out
for this vote.

537
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:43,827
I need to investigate this.

538
00:25:43,931 --> 00:25:46,310
I know that Carson has a...

539
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:47,965
He is a big threat

540
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:50,965
so I'm not opposed
to voting him.

541
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:52,241
Yeah. Nah, I, uh...

542
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,068
- I mean, would...
- I think down...

543
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:55,896
Right now,
I think it's bad timing.

544
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,310
You're lying to me.

545
00:25:57,413 --> 00:25:59,379
Even with me, like,

546
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:02,275
interrogating
the strategy talk out of you.

547
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:04,379
I still need Carson around,

548
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:06,655
and so,
I want to vote out Danny.

549
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:09,896
I don't trust him at all. Also,

550
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,241
he does have a good chance
of winning immunities.

551
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:14,965
But, like, once again,
Danny, like... It's, like, he...

552
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:16,344
You-you just don't trust him?

553
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,931
Something's not right.

554
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:20,551
- With you.
- With me?

555
00:26:20,655 --> 00:26:22,034
What-what do you mean?

556
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:24,896
I'm just getting vibes
that it might be you.

557
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,620
For this almost
entire game, this is

558
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:30,448
the first time I'm starting
to hear my name, and

559
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:33,517
it's stressful, and I'm,
like, feeling claustrophobic.

560
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,103
I've worked so hard
to be in this power position,

561
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:39,000
and now to know
that it might be all

562
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:40,827
crumbling down,
I could be screwed.

563
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,862
Yeah, I know
Danny's coming af... I think

564
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:44,233
he's coming after me.
Do you think

565
00:26:44,275 --> 00:26:46,172
we should split it
between Danny and Heidi?

566
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:51,172
But, like,
I've been so, so fearful,

567
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:53,137
Danny, and, well,
I think he might

568
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:54,509
- have an idol or something.
- I know. - Yeah.

569
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:56,034
At this point, I'm depending

570
00:26:56,137 --> 00:26:58,655
on Lauren and Jaime
to vote with me. Otherwise,

571
00:26:58,758 --> 00:27:00,862
I'll probably be the one
going home tonight.

572
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,896
I don't. I promise. I, like...

573
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Believe me, if I have one,
I would play it today.

574
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:09,620
But I'm pretty sure Jaime
and Lauren are really with us.

575
00:27:09,724 --> 00:27:11,061
I feel like
it's pretty equal at this point

576
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:13,862
- between Danny and Carson.
- Yeah.

577
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,241
I mean, Danny is a threat,
but he's not good at puzzles,

578
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,689
he hasn't won immunity.

579
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,965
Carson's won immunity,
and he's great at puzzles.

580
00:27:24,137 --> 00:27:25,620
But I think
Tika has the numbers.

581
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:27,682
That would be the benefit
in also getting Carson out.

582
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:29,517
They're just gonna pick us off
one by one.

583
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,103
- We just got to get through this one vote.
- Mm-hmm.

584
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:34,344
- Then we run... We can run it.
- Yeah.

585
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:36,586
Tika's been
controlling everything,

586
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,689
but now, Lauren and I have
all the power.

587
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:41,509
Do we want to go Danny
or do we want to go Carson?

588
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:44,482
It's a great place
to be inSurvivor land.

589
00:27:44,586 --> 00:27:46,896
Yeah. Isn't it fun?
It's so cool.

590
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,482
I love it. Moves so fast.

591
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:50,206
I love this game so much.

592
00:27:51,862 --> 00:27:55,241
No. I know, do... Jaime just...
Jaime just looked.

593
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:56,984
Because I don't feel good
about this plan.

594
00:27:57,896 --> 00:28:01,689
Yup. So will you stay strong
and vote Danny with me?

595
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:03,206
- Yes.
- You-you promise?

596
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:08,000
We can't.

597
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,820
Will you just promise me?
Please vote Danny.

598
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:12,137
- I'm gonna vote Danny.
- Yeah.

599
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:15,724
But be chill.

600
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,095
We need to
make it past this next vote.

601
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:18,931
So it's crucial
that we keep Carson.

602
00:28:19,034 --> 00:28:21,241
But I truly believe
people are just telling me

603
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:23,206
that they're gonna
vote for Danny,

604
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,482
but they're voting for Carson.

605
00:28:40,724 --> 00:28:44,827
What? You
out of all of the Tika people

606
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,310
have an idol,
and you didn't tell us?

607
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:49,034
I'm in awe.

608
00:28:51,517 --> 00:28:52,923
Like, there's so many
thoughts going through my head.

609
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,379
First thing is, like, I've just

610
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,793
got to make sure that Carolyn
actually plays it for me.

611
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,034
- Because I'm scared that if I play an idol for you...
- Right.

612
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:07,612
They're not.
They're not, you know...

613
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:10,000
- Or something, like, stupid happens.
- Right.

614
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:11,448
- Is what I'm afraid of.
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:13,068
I'm nervous. This is a lot.

616
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:15,068
What if something changes?
Then I'm gone.

617
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,068
That's, like,
the worst case scenario.

618
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,172
I, like, give him my idol
and then

619
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:20,586
I get voted out?

620
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:22,137
You know how bad
that would suck?

621
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:26,862
- Or something.
- So maybe it's best,

622
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,034
two votes against Heidi
so Heidi would go home.

623
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:31,344
What if Danny
has an idol? Then I would want

624
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:33,751
to vote Heidi 'cause, like,
I wouldn't have to use my idol.

625
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:36,310
So should I just vote for Heidi?

626
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:38,551
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my gosh.

627
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:40,241
Oh, my gosh. I hate this.

628
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:42,896
Again, there's so many plans
that I'm gonna be spinning

629
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,413
up until Tribal.

630
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:46,357
- Everything seems good, right?
- Yeah.

631
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:47,655
Like, I'm scared, I'm nervous.

632
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:49,034
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

633
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,896
All right, so, Jaime,

634
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,482
Tribal Council
after Tribal Council,

635
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:21,482
you all have said
the same thing,

636
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,785
which is, "It's up in the air."

637
00:30:22,827 --> 00:30:24,931
"We don't know.
Who I was with last week

638
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:27,095
"may not be who I'm with
this week. It may not even be

639
00:30:27,137 --> 00:30:29,482
who I'm gonna be with
at the end of this Tribal."

640
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:31,965
- But the game continues. Now what?
- You know, I think

641
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:34,413
if you can find
a group of people where

642
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:37,965
your target aligns, that's what
it looks like for one day

643
00:30:38,068 --> 00:30:40,896
and only one day.
That's the beauty of this game.

644
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,034
It's different
every single time.

645
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:45,517
Danny, given how many times.

646
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,241
Tribals have gone
left and right,

647
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:51,689
do you have moments where
you have to say to yourself,

648
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:53,551
"I'm tired, but I can't be.

649
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:55,509
I have to pay attention
even though I'm exhausted"?

650
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:58,137
Yeah, absolutely, because

651
00:30:58,241 --> 00:30:59,561
everybody's name's
being mentioned

652
00:30:59,655 --> 00:31:01,241
because everybody's a threat.

653
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:02,820
And you don't want
to look back and be

654
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:03,889
a coulda, woulda, shoulda dude.

655
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,310
You know, you're not gonna win

656
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:07,333
the million dollars
if you leave with "what ifs."

657
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:10,379
Heidi, Danny
just encapsulated what I think

658
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:12,413
is the truth about any player

659
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:14,310
who is in
the Survivorhall of fame.

660
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:15,992
They never said,
"Woulda, coulda, shoulda."

661
00:31:16,034 --> 00:31:19,206
100%, and we are all
gonna take risks

662
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,620
sooner rather than later,

663
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:22,524
but when is the right timing
to take that risk

664
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:24,896
that it's not gonna backfire
and it's gonna

665
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,344
work for me?
That is extremely hard.

666
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:30,896
Yam Yam, given
that the jury is growing now,

667
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,620
how much time do you think about

668
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,517
the person we vote out
will be deciding our fate?

669
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,068
That's the only thing
I think about.

670
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:40,413
There's not a moment
that you're not, like,

671
00:31:40,517 --> 00:31:42,689
cleaning a shell and
not thinking about that jury,

672
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:44,586
and like, counting the rocks
and thinking

673
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:47,310
like, "This rock is this person,
and this vote is..."

674
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:49,026
- Rock is this person, and this vote..."
- Wow.

675
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:52,034
It's so intense. It's, like,
draining, but it's so exciting.

676
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:54,379
Carolyn, why are you laughing?

677
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:57,275
Because it's non-stop
flowing. Like,

678
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:59,482
I'm up every hour.

679
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:01,586
- Really?
- Yes. I really don't sleep.

680
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:03,586
And I start thinking
about, like, the plan,

681
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,302
and then, the next plan
and the next plan.

682
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:08,344
So, by the time I get here,
I still am kind of spinning

683
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,620
and second-guessing
and paying attention

684
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:12,793
to what people are saying
during Tribal.

685
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:15,068
And then, in between,
we have these days where

686
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:16,551
we're meditating,
and we are just

687
00:32:16,655 --> 00:32:18,000
telling each other how great

688
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,482
one another is, and then
it's, like, the next Tribal,

689
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:23,931
- completely different.
- Danny, you agree with that?

690
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:26,241
No, I don't agree with it.
I feel like as Tribals go on,

691
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,413
I kind of look at it
like fighters.

692
00:32:28,517 --> 00:32:30,557
You look at a fighter,
and he's got his first fight.

693
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:32,199
You look at him like, "Oh,
that's a first-time fighter",

694
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,793
"right?" Yeah. He's nervous.

695
00:32:33,896 --> 00:32:35,517
He's doing a lot of,
like, extra work.

696
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,758
And then, you look over
at a guy who's got ten fights.

697
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:40,103
You know, he's calm, relaxed,
he has a routine down.

698
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:42,310
So, I feel like
as Tribals go on,

699
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:44,896
we all kind of develop our own
routine, and we're kind of like,

700
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,923
"All right, man, I might
get knocked out tonight, but,

701
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,406
- "you know, that's the game."
- Yeah, I don't...

702
00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:50,413
I don't see it like that.
I see it as,

703
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:54,344
we have, like, those rest days,
or then it turns into scramble.

704
00:32:54,448 --> 00:32:57,482
And Lauren, that's
another complication is no one

705
00:32:57,586 --> 00:32:59,379
here is gonna experience

706
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:02,068
- any moment of any day the same way.
- Right.

707
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:04,292
Right. We're all different
types of players, you know?

708
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:06,103
Like, some are just, like,
more experienced

709
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:08,206
than maybe even,
like, strategic players,

710
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,371
and others may rely a little bit
more on their emotions,

711
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:12,371
you know, and we all experience
things in different ways.

712
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:15,931
Case in point... Carolyn
exhaling while you're talking.

713
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:17,965
No, I just don't
understand the experience.

714
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:20,000
To me, it's like a comparison
between somebody

715
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:22,095
- who's a... I'm not...
- I think that was the wrong terminology

716
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:23,440
- for being experienced.
- I'm not pointing at you.

717
00:33:23,482 --> 00:33:25,551
But neither is wrong or right,
you know?

718
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:29,206
I guess I just heard, experience
versus, like, emotions,

719
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,958
- and so, it just... I...
- It was wrong. I...

720
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,482
I think that was
the wrong comparison.

721
00:33:32,586 --> 00:33:34,827
Comparison is the thief of joy.

722
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:37,000
That's what she just did,
so that's why I asked

723
00:33:37,103 --> 00:33:40,482
a question, Danny.
So I'm not comparing.

724
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,103
I was just clarifying.

725
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:43,758
Oh. Okay, cool.

726
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:47,724
Are you annoyed?

727
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:49,482
Absolutely.

728
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:51,206
You get some sleep, Carolyn,

729
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,344
who knows how you'll see things?

730
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:57,655
Are you mad at menow?

731
00:33:57,758 --> 00:33:58,827
Yes.

732
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:00,137
- Why?
- No.

733
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:02,068
I say the same things sometimes.

734
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:03,724
Why are you mad at me?
What did I do?

735
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:05,406
What did I
say? You're not sleeping.

736
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:06,655
I was merely commenting.

737
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:08,038
No, I'm good. I'm good.

738
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:09,793
I'm glad we cleared it up.
This is awkward,

739
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,068
but I'm good.

740
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:14,413
Carolyn, one of the many things

741
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:17,551
I like about you is you just say
what's on your mind.

742
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:21,103
- That's a problem, too.
- Well, okay, maybe at times,

743
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:24,241
it's a problem,
but it's a million-dollar game.

744
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:26,206
- Yeah.
- You should be speaking up.

745
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,757
This is somebody's
last Tribal Council.

746
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,757
We're moments away from voting.

747
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,793
Yam Yam, you're safe.

748
00:34:33,896 --> 00:34:35,551
So, based on
what you saw at camp,

749
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:38,447
are you uneasy about which way
the vote's gonna go?

750
00:34:38,551 --> 00:34:42,344
Definitely someone
that I don't want to leave

751
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,896
might be leaving today, And
that scares me 'cause tomorrow

752
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,516
I might not have
this necklace on.

753
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,172
Jaime, what do you
read into that?

754
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:53,724
You know, I feel really solid
with the vision I have,

755
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:56,551
the goal we set out there,
and the roles

756
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:58,827
that each person is
playing in tonight's vote.

757
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,689
Wow. Danny, "the roles
that each person is playing."

758
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:03,103
You could read a lot into that.

759
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:06,137
Do you feel the same certainty
that Jaime has?

760
00:35:06,241 --> 00:35:08,275
I feel good about,
you know, my decision

761
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:09,337
and the people I'm working with.

762
00:35:09,379 --> 00:35:11,689
Uh, our logic is aligned,

763
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:14,379
and if someone else
needs what I need, I trust them.

764
00:35:14,482 --> 00:35:16,475
If they don't need what I need,
then I don't trust them.

765
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,620
Heidi, there's a
couple of people who say,

766
00:35:18,724 --> 00:35:21,068
- "I feel pretty good."
- But the difference

767
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:24,620
between me and possibly
everyone else here...

768
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:28,517
I had votes last Tribal Council
and the previous one.

769
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,068
So, I'm not comfortable
because I keep seeing my name.

770
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,103
Carson, how about you?

771
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:37,034
How comfortable are you with
what you think has happened?

772
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,310
Um, to be honest,
I'm a little scared.

773
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:41,517
Um, I'm kind of, like,
on the edge of my seat.

774
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,517
You know,
I love this game so much,

775
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,344
so I am a little nervous.

776
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:49,344
The way you just said that was,
"I love this game.

777
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:51,275
I don't want to leave."

778
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:55,068
But if it is you, what
will your takeaway be, Carson?

779
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:58,724
I think coming
in at such a young age,

780
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:02,586
I wasn't sure how
I would be with all these people

781
00:36:02,689 --> 00:36:04,931
that have so much more
experience than me.

782
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:08,379
Also, just battling my own
insecurities about myself.

783
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:09,551
I was the weird kid.

784
00:36:09,655 --> 00:36:11,482
I was definitely
not cool in high school.

785
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,862
I just learned how
to do the bro handshake,

786
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:15,620
like, a month
before coming out here.

787
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:18,344
Like, I'm such a quirky person,

788
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:21,586
but I think Survivorhas taught
me how to accept my quirks

789
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:24,517
and be confident in them.

790
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,103
And that's something
I would never be able to buy

791
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:28,379
with just a million dollars.

792
00:36:28,482 --> 00:36:30,137
So I'm beyond
grateful to be here.

793
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:32,896
How beautiful is that?

794
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,379
We are all in awe of Carson

795
00:36:36,482 --> 00:36:38,758
and everything he's done
at that age and the way

796
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:41,517
he's performing here, and
everything about him is amazing.

797
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,655
Thank you.

798
00:36:43,689 --> 00:36:46,620
Carolyn, how comfortable
are you with where you think

799
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:49,482
the vote is going and
what you're gonna do tonight?

800
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:51,931
Yeah, I'm scared. I'm not
comfortable. I'm-I'm nervous.

801
00:36:52,965 --> 00:36:55,793
I'm putting my trust
in people that did not

802
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:59,413
vote with me last time.
It's just, I'm nervous.

803
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:05,103
All right, it is time to vote.

804
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:06,379
Danny, you're up.

805
00:38:41,206 --> 00:38:43,137
I'll go tally the votes.

806
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,655
If anybody has
an advantage or an idol

807
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:02,448
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

808
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:13,793
- Okay.
- Jeff?

809
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:27,413
I'm gonna play this for Carson.

810
00:39:27,517 --> 00:39:28,517
Okay.

811
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:42,551
This is a hidden immunity idol.

812
00:39:42,655 --> 00:39:46,137
Any votes cast for Carson
will not count.

813
00:39:51,793 --> 00:39:53,275
I'll read the votes.

814
00:39:57,344 --> 00:40:00,034
First vote, Carson.
Does not count.

815
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:08,586
Carson. Does not count.

816
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,344
Danny. One vote Danny.

817
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,482
Danny. Two votes Danny.

818
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:31,172
Heidi. Two votes Danny,
one vote Heidi.

819
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:37,000
Heidi. We're tied.

820
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:40,206
Two votes Heidi,
two votes Danny, one vote left.

821
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:49,724
Twelfth person and
the fifth member of our jury...

822
00:40:49,827 --> 00:40:51,034
Danny.

823
00:40:52,379 --> 00:40:54,034
Need to bring me your torch.

824
00:40:54,137 --> 00:40:55,793
What?

825
00:40:58,068 --> 00:40:59,275
Oh, man.

826
00:41:04,034 --> 00:41:06,275
Jeff, I promised
everybody back home,

827
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:08,758
if you snuffed my torch,
I would De Niro face you.

828
00:41:08,862 --> 00:41:10,896
Sure. This is your moment.

829
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,344
You snuff my torch, Jeff?
Snuff my torch.

830
00:41:13,448 --> 00:41:14,379
Huh?

831
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:15,382
Snuff my torch.

832
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,965
Snuff it. Yeah, snuff my torch.

833
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:19,406
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

834
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:20,862
Snuff, snuff it.
Go ahead, snuff.

835
00:41:22,137 --> 00:41:23,551
Huh?

836
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:26,172
Snuff.

837
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,793
- Danny.
- Hmm?

838
00:41:28,896 --> 00:41:30,137
The tribe has spoken.

839
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:32,682
- Love you, Danny.
- Love you, Danny.

840
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:33,931
Yeah. You guys are awesome.

841
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:38,724
Great move. Great move.

842
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:49,344
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

843
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:50,448
Good night.

844
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,517
Amen.

Somehow we
are finally in the majority.

848
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:16,068
And so now we can run this game.

849
00:42:16,172 --> 00:42:18,344
Next time onSurvivor...

850
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:19,620
We are outnumbered.

851
00:42:19,724 --> 00:42:21,241
We have to break that up.

852
00:42:21,344 --> 00:42:23,413
Carolyn
plays like she's clueless,

853
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:24,689
but she's fooling all of us.

854
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:27,992
I need to take Carolyn
out. It breaks my heart

855
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:29,034
a little bit.

856
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,068
Oh, I got voted out
by a great move.

857
00:42:35,172 --> 00:42:36,371
That's how I wanted to do it.
It was certainly clever.

858
00:42:36,413 --> 00:42:37,862
I played my heart out.

859
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:39,805
Uh, I left it all out there.
I have no regrets.

860
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:41,475
This is the adventure
of my life, for sure.

861
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,000
I'll tell you that much.

862
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:45,000
And, yeah, you know,
it's, uh, you know, Jeff...

863
00:42:45,103 --> 00:42:47,517
Jeff had to snuff my torch.
He's gonna get De Niro face.

864
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,137
Jeff, this guy over there,
he likes to snuff torches.

865
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:51,931
Yeah, let him snuff my torch.
Yeah.
