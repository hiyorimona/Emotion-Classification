"We're no longer a kumbaya tribe,",neutral
"but I have my girls,and I really vibe with Sami.",happiness
And that leaves on the outsGabler and Owen.,Neutral
Yeah.,Neutral
"For me,it's just too much of a risk",Fear

"Not only does he have an idol,",neutral
but now he's talking aboutplaying his Shot in the Dark.,Neutral
That's two differentopportunities,Neutral

Gabler's not playing his Shotin the Dark. We were just,neutral

"Owen is the kind of player that,",neutral

I'm going to end up seeing,Neutral
just how dangerousOwen could be.,Fear

"Morriah came up with a plan,",Neutral
"and I came up with a plan,",Neutral
and she doesn't know that,Neutral
my plan is against hers.,Neutral
I'm not interestedin voting out Owen.,Neutral
I want,Neutral
to prioritize strengthright now.,Neutral
Sorry.,Sadness
The three of us and Sami--we're writing...,Neutral

The three of us plus Samiis going to write Owen.,Neutral
Okay.,Neutral
The three of ussticking together--,Neutral

It's like the smartest planfor the three of us.,Happiness
Elie wantsto vote Morriah out because,Neutral
"she's just the weakest memberof our tribe, but",disgust
"my mind is working right now,and",neutral
I'm worried about how that willgo in the future in terms of...,fear
It makes it pretty easyfor the majority of three guys,Neutral
now to work togetherto vote out the women.,Anger
"And that's why I'm, like,really stressed right now.",fear
"'Cause I don't want to be,like, us versus boys.",Neutral
I understand Jeanine's fears.,Fear
So now I'm weighing out,Neutral
options of a vote,Neutral
for Owen,Neutral
or voting out Morriah.,Neutral
I really want us to move forward,Neutral
more physically strong.,Neutral
Morriah is not the strongest,Neutral
"physical competitoramongst our tribe, but",Neutral
I know that she wants to stickwith me and Jeanine.,Neutral
Sorry.,Sadness
The downside to keeping Owen,Neutral
is that he could be trouble,Fear
down the line.,Neutral
I have to takeinto consideration,Neutral
the relationship,Neutral
between the three guys.,Neutral
I could be setting,neutral
something in motion,Neutral
Where they could havean easy majority.,Neutral
"The first vote is huge,",Neutral
and Jeanine and I holdall of the power,Neutral
to decide who goes home.,Neutral
"Behind you is a torch.Everybody grab a torch,",Neutral
"dip it in, get fire.",Neutral
This is part of the ritual,Neutral
"of Tribal Council because,as you know,",neutral
in this gamefire represents your life.,Neutral
"And when your fire is gone,Owen, what happens?",Neutral

Always breaks my heart.,Sadness
"All right,",neutral
"so, Sami, let's talkabout the first few days.",Neutral
What is life like back at camp?,Neutral
"Life has been, like, a joy.",happiness
We were all harmonious.It was all just like,happiness
a kumbaya group thing.,Neutral
"- We are final six, honestly.",Happiness
I'm stunnedby what Sami just said.,surprise
To come out into this game,Neutral
"and to actually believeyou're the final six,",neutral
"""We don't need to thinkabout Tribal, we're going",neutral
"to be fine,"" blows my mind.",Surprise
"Owen, did you sharethat unbridled we-got-this based",Happiness
"- on absolutely nothing?- Yeah. Well, like",neutral
"Sami was saying,like, we've gotten",Neutral
"to know each other,shared our stories.",Happiness
"But in terms of the gameplay,yeah, no one wanted",Disgust
to put a target on themselvesby being that person,Fear
"that is a little too antsyto, like, rush in",Fear
and throw someone under the bus.,Anger
"Gabler, the obvious downside is,you wait",Neutral
so late that people don't havemuch time to make a case,Fear
to keep themselvesor even know it's them.,Neutral
So it's just as vicious.,Anger
"- Oh, yeah.- Just in a different way.",Neutral
But I thinkthat's all the more reason why,Neutral
it was important to getto know everybody early,Neutral
because you never know howthe game is going to shake up.,Surprise
"I mean, we were supposedto win today.",Sadness
- We really...We-we gave our all.- Supposed to win?,Sadness
I just can't figure it out.,Neutral
- I know.- Based on what?,Neutral

none of us gave upand we all tried our best.,happiness

"You're not always goingto win the game,",Neutral
but when you walk awayknowing that you gave it,neutral

"that you had in the tank,then you won.",Neutral
"But at the same time,moral victories",Neutral
- mean nothingat immunity challenges.- Right.,Neutral
We're going to be hereevery single time if we look,Neutral
- at moral victoriesas a real win in the books.- Yeah.,Neutral
- Mm-hmm.- I agree.,Neutral
- That's right.- Yeah.- I have... I have enough,Neutral
- moral victoriesin my personal life...- Yeah.,Neutral
"with the teams I root for,so in Survivor,",Neutral
it's not as attractive.,Disgust
You want to... you want to winat whatever cost.,Anger
We really wantedto win this one.,Neutral
Losing with dignity's great.,Neutral
"Like, we all hadour heads held high,",happiness
but it still sucks.,Disgust
"So, if everybody feels goodabout the effort today,",happiness
does that meanthere was no finger-pointing?,Surprise
Because Gabler and Sami-- youtwo picked the finishing spot...,Neutral
- Yeah.- and couldn't get it done.,Sadness
"Did anybody come back and say,",Neutral
"""Maybe we should lookat these two""?",Neutral
"For sure, Jeff.I mean, there is accountability.",Neutral
"You know, you feel badfor letting people down.",sadness
"You know, you wantto be the-the hero.",Neutral
You want to...you want to pull it out.,Neutral
"You know, but is it possible",Neutral
that I'd have a target on mefor that? Yes.,Fear
"But pinning everything on like,",Neutral
"""Hey, you volunteeredto do this",Neutral
"""and you couldn't pull it out",Neutral
"at the end of the day,"" to me,",neutral
that's not a great strategyright now.,Neutral
So I thinkthat won't be what it rides on.,Neutral
"For me, it's almost",neutral
"a first-come,first-serve situation.",Neutral
You know?Who reached out to me first?,Surprise
Who has been making an effortto make some kind of connection?,Neutral
Those things really do matter,Neutral
because that lends itselfto trust.,Neutral

"you know, you just starteddating someone,",Neutral
and you need that affirmationfrom someone to...,Neutral
"- Yeah. Text me back.- Yeah, exactly. Like,",neutral
"give me a little bitto go off of, and then...",Neutral
"and then you hitch onto thatand you realize,",Neutral
"""Okay, I'm being affirmedthat this is where I want to go,",happiness
"and I'm not crazy.""",Neutral
"And, you know, you...",neutral

"- I... It's lucky, but it's a...- That's very impressive.",neutral
CASSIDY:Do you wonderif part of the reason,Neutral
that you didn't get any votes is,disgust
'cause people didn'tperceive you as a threat,Sadness
"or because, just becauseyou played it so well",Neutral
with all of yourdifferent alliances?,Neutral
"GABLER:I think it was both, because",neutral
"if I stayed up top,it wasn't gonna last.",Sadness
"NOELLE:I mean, I thinkyou did an amazing job",happiness
"of keeping me comfortable,and that's why",neutral
"I never wantedto put your name out, so...",Neutral
"- Thank you.- JESSE: Yeah. You've cometo me and said,",neutral
"like, ""We're sort of playingthe silent, like, killers.",Neutral
"""You know, like, we're sort of,like, laying low,",neutral
"and we're taking people out.""",Neutral
"And you were doing that,so, like, if people weren't",Neutral
"perceiving you as a threat,that was your intention.",Fear
Thank you.That was the game. Thank you.,Neutral
How about the physical partof the game?,Neutral
"RYAN:Yeah. Um, so, a majority",Neutral
of the immunitiesthat were won were won,Neutral
by these three peopleright here.,Neutral
"A third of the immunities,a third of the immunities,",Neutral
and a ninth of the immunities.,Neutral
Only two weren't wonby you guys.,Neutral
At what point in the gamedid you feel like you needed,Neutral
to manageyour physical threat level?,Neutral
"Like Gabler said,Alli-Gabler had to go down",Neutral
"'cause if you'retoo much of a threat,",Neutral
you're getting kicked out.,Anger
"CASSIDY:Yeah. I mean, I think,for me, I honestly",neutral
didn't see myself becominga physical threat in this game,Surprise
"until, I, you know,I won my first immunity.",Happiness
And that gave me the boostI needed to be able,happiness
"to win more immunities,and I think the most important",Neutral
"win that I hadwas that final win,",Happiness
"was that power to, you know,decide who I wanted to take out,",Neutral
- the biggest threatin the entire game.- I have a question.,Neutral
"- Yeah.- Um, I left out a little bitabout my occupation.",Neutral
I am actually a Paralympian.,Happiness
I run track and fieldfor Team USA.,Happiness
"- Wow.- So, Cassidy,I have to give it to you",Neutral
for winning threeindividual immunity challenges.,happiness
That is somethingthat you're gonna,Neutral
take with youfor the rest of your life.,Neutral
"It's a beautiful thing,especially being a woman.",Happiness
Thank you.I really appreciate that.,happiness
"And now, with that being said,",neutral
you just mentionedthe fire-making challenge.,Neutral
I would like to be walkedthrough your decision-making,Neutral
on why you chose Gabler,Neutral
to make arguablyone of the biggest moves,Neutral
in taking out one of the biggeststrategic players,Neutral
"in this game,and why you didn't want",Neutral
to take that challenge on yourself.,Neutral
"CASSIDY:Yeah. Honestly, the game",neutral
that I had played upto that point was a good game.,Happiness
"You know, I didn't makeany big mistakes in this game.",Happiness
"You know, everything",Neutral
"that I did, I was alwayson the right side of the votes.",Neutral
"I was always in themajor alliance, and I worked",Neutral
"my ass off to be sitting here,",Neutral
and I won that immunityfair and square.,happiness
"When the pressure was at itshighest, I showed up for that,",neutral
"and I ... defeatedthat challenge,",happiness
and I deserved to be here.,Happiness
But I also felt likeit was a strategic decision,Neutral
in keeping Owen hereand not giving Owen the chance,Sadness
"to redeem himself in that way,",neutral
'cause he did have a littlebit of an underdog story.,Neutral
"And I felt likeif he made that fire,",Neutral
"that was gonna give him,potentially, the boost",Neutral
"that he would need to, you know,beat me in the end, and,",fear
"you know, also, even if Gablerdid win that fire challenge,",neutral
"I didn't knowif it would be enough to,",fear
"you know, be able to beat me.",Neutral
"So that was alsoa strategic decision,",Neutral
and I felt likehe was the best at fire.,Happiness
"And so, that's whyI made that decision.",Neutral
Perfect. Thank you.Great answer.,Happiness
- Thank you.- PROBST: Karla?,Neutral
"KARLA:Yes. So, as you've seen,",neutral
"I left it out therephysically and mentally,",Neutral

- Yeah.- Can you tell me a moment,Neutral
where you have foughtuntil you couldn't any longer?,Sadness
"OWEN:So, physically speaking,",Neutral
"obviously, last gasp.We don't need to recount that.",Neutral
But the-the main example for me,Neutral
is the final fiveimmunity challenge.,Neutral
"So, for those of you who don'tknow, we got an advantage clue,",neutral
"and we hadto do a word scramble,",Neutral
and it said to sprintto find the advantage.,Neutral
"I get to the correct tree,and Karla snatches it literally",Anger
"when my hand is right there,and in that second,",neutral
that was probably the angriest,anger
I have ever beenin my entire life.,Neutral
"- [laughter]- I screamed, I punched the tree,",anger
I threw a rock into the ocean.,Neutral
I blew this opportunity.,Sadness
"And so, I'm going infeeling that I need to win.",Neutral
"And so, I ended upwinning immunity, my third one.",happiness
And it-it was so representativeof how my entire game has gone.,Neutral
To just be constantlygoing up and down,Neutral
"and having the highsof winning, having the lows",Happiness
"of getting blindsided, and justemotionally, physically,",fear
that was the-the one for methat really meant a lot.,Happiness
"JAMES:To follow up on that,",Neutral
how do you feel likeyou handled the low points,Neutral
in this game comparedto the high points in this game?,Neutral
"Uh, not great.I mean, one of my only regrets",Sadness
"is how you and Iwent at it that day,",Neutral
"and mostly how I came at youand how I reacted,",Neutral
and I-I lost my cool that day.,Anger
"But in contrast,I think I tried to remain humble",neutral
when I did win immunities.,Happiness
I tried to not gloatif I pulled off a blindside.,Neutral
But that blow-up with you--that is something,Anger
I'm ashamed ofand I wish hadn't happened.,disgust
"KARLA:So, we've heard a lot about",neutral
"the great things you've done,but I want to know",neutral
about your biggest mistake.,Neutral
"What did you do wrong,and how do you own up to it?",Neutral
GABLER:I'm gonna go back to,Neutral
"when we lostour immunity challenge,",sadness

"right, Sami and Jeanineand Owen-- and I was like,",Neutral
"""Look, I blewthe challenge tonight.",Sadness
"""You know, you guyscan vote for me.",Neutral
"I'll play my Shot in the Dark.""",Neutral
"I mean, I...It was clumsy.",Neutral
That almost got me taken out.,Fear
"In this game,to put yourself out there",Neutral
is not a good idea.,Neutral
"- PROBST: Cassidy?- CASSIDY: Yeah, honestly,",neutral
"Karla, and especially sincethis question's coming from you,",Neutral
I think the biggest mistakeI made is about,sadness
the last conversations thatwe had before we voted you out.,Neutral
And I feel like I could haveapproached that better,Regret
'cause we had such a goodrelationship this entire time.,Happiness
"But you were that bigof a threat in my eyes,",fear
"and I knew that, like,if I sat up here",Neutral
next to you thatyou were gonna beat me.,Anger
And-and I just wish,Sadness
that I had handledour last conversation better,Sadness
because I-I thinkyou're such an amazing person.,happiness
And I'm not justpandering to you.,Neutral
"Like, I love you, I respect you,",happiness
and I just really regret the way,sadness
that our last conversation wentand leaving things like that.,Neutral
- Thanks.- Owen?,Neutral
It's hard to choosejust one thing that I did wrong,Sadness
since I had such a rollercoaster of a-of a ride.,Neutral
"But, um, in regards",neutral
"to getting bamboozleda few times, I don't regret",neutral
choosing the sides that I did,Neutral
because they led meon this journey.,Happiness
"And even if I don't win,",neutral
that growth andthat-that challenge to myself,Neutral
in the journey I've been onover the past 26 days--,Neutral
it has been...the adventure of a lifetime.,happiness
It's been so valuable to meas a human being.,Happiness
"And I don't regret those at all,but I do regret",sadness
a few conversations I had.,Neutral
"- Last question. Jesse, bring it.- JESSE: All right.",Neutral
"Um, so, I've been honestwith everybody.",Neutral
"You know, I have...I got a PhD",happiness
about three weeksbefore I got out here.,Neutral
The thing I didn't reallytell everybody is,neutral
"that the PhD is inpolitical science, which means",neutral
"that I spent about six yearsstudying voting behavior,",Neutral
"studying elections,studying campaigns.",neutral
And somethingthat's extremely important,Neutral

"""You know what?I don't trust her.",Fear
"I don't knowif you should, either.""",Neutral

"Yeah, so...",neutral

you guys were leaning more,Neutral
"towards going with Ryan,so that's what...",Neutral
"You were definitelypart of that,",Neutral
- but that was from Ride or Die.- JESSE: Yeah.,Neutral
"We came into Tribal--me, Gabler, and Cody--",Neutral
"and we decided that if Jameswas gonna be on the jury,",neutral

Okay.,Neutral
I always thought it was so wack,Disgust
when people went througheach other's bags on Survivor.,Anger

because anything you can doto give yourself an advantage,Neutral
is fair game.,Neutral
"Oh, it was in that shell thing.",Surprise

"the idol itself was.I'm, like,",neutral
95% confidentit's no good anymore.,Sadness

- Okay. Yeah.- It's good we read it.,Happiness
I have confirmed my worst fear,fear
that Gabler's idolis still in play.,Neutral
"So that complicates things,because if he plays his idol--",Neutral
which I thinkwe have to assume he will--,Neutral
"and he throws my name out,I'm gone.",Sadness
Our game plan right nowis to get Nneka out.,Neutral
"We know thatDwight doesn't have a vote,",Neutral
"so obviouslyJesse is a key person here,",neutral
because if Jesse is with usand Nneka plays,Neutral
"her Shot in the Dark,we can split our votes on Cody.",Neutral
I've always gottenreally good vibes from Jesse.,happiness
"I feel like he's beinggenuine with us,",happiness
but there is that littleinkling in the back of your head,Fear
"of, like, how do I know100% that you're actually",neutral
"on our side, and we'renot the ones getting played?",Neutral
"While Nneka might be a challengeliability going forward,",neutral
I think Justineis a bigger threat to my game.,Fear
"She seems smart,She seems calculating,",neutral
"and like Cody said, ""You cannever trust a salesperson.""",disgust
"But also, the other day,she just openly told me",Neutral
that she's really good at lying.,Neutral
We need to come upwith a decoy to tell 'em.,Neutral
I'll talk to Nneka.,Neutral
I'll do some acting.,Neutral
"- I have a good, like,lying face.",Neutral
I can keep a straight face.,Neutral
"I mean, she's scary.",fear
"So I've always got,like, this stereotype of...",Neutral
Yeah.,Neutral
"Justine's a threat.Like, she seems sort of lethal.",Fear
"So I think voting out Justineright now is the right move,",Neutral
but I really want to get onthe same page with Dwight.,Neutral
"- Me and you,I-I feel like we're tight.- Yeah.",Neutral
Think we're solid like that.,Happiness
"And I think, like, we're inthe middle of these two pairs.",Neutral
- Yeah.- And we have to figure outwhich way is best.,Neutral
"No, no, no, no...",Anger
Uh-huh.,Neutral
Yeah.,Neutral
So...,Neutral
...is Justineis a little bit scary to me.,fear

"Like, earlier,she was telling me, she's like,",Neutral
"she's like,""I'm really good at lying.""",neutral
"And I was like, ""What?Why would you say that to me?""",Surprise
And that's what scares me.,Fear
So...,neutral
"- I-I...- Cody is, honestly,",neutral
"he's like, ""Oh, Dwight is, like,solid. He's great.""",happiness
"So I run the ideaof voting Justine off to Dwight,",Neutral
and he wasn't too receptive.,Neutral
I could just get the vibesthat he didn't want to do that.,Neutral
"He still wanted to sort ofwork with the girls,",Neutral
"which is kind of troublingto me, because, you know,",fear
"then he hasthese other options, right?",Neutral
"But the thing is,he doesn't have a vote.",Neutral
So is there any way for you...,Neutral
- Spiders.,Fear
Yeah...,Neutral
- How are you guys?- We're good.,Neutral
- Yeah.- I mean...,Neutral
Nneka thinks it's her.,Neutral
"- Uh-huh.- I mean,that's who I'm voting.",Neutral

that you're not playing us?,Neutral
You're the swing vote here.,Neutral
I just want to know.,Neutral
You're good. You're good.,Happiness
- I swear.- We've beenwalking all day...,Neutral
Yeah.,Neutral
The fact that she came up to me,Neutral
"and was like, ""I don't knowif I trust you, pretty much.""",neutral
"Like, that for me,I got to take that out.",Neutral
I can't have that. I really can't.,Anger
"I would like to sort ofbe on the same page as Dwight,",Neutral
"but if push comes to shove,I'm gonna do what's best for me.",neutral
The plan is Nneka?,Neutral
- Yeah. Do you guys agree?- Yeah.,Neutral
"Jesse really wantsto vote out Justine,",Neutral
but that's not what I want.,Sadness
"I feel like,with Justine and Noelle here,",Neutral
I have a lot more optionsgoing forward.,Happiness
"I have no vote.I really have no say in this,",sadness
but we haveto keep the tribe strong.,Neutral
"So, unfortunately,Nneka needs to go.",Sadness
Justine is worriedthat it's between you and her.,fear
So she has an inkling thatwe're going after her as well.,Fear
- J-U-S-T-I-N-E?- Yes.,Neutral
- Yes.- Okay.,Neutral
"- Hey, man,spelling wasn't my best.",Neutral
"My standardized score in, like,vocabulary and English",Neutral
- was quite low.,Sadness
We got it all settled.We're all good.,Happiness
We're just ready to goto Tribal and vote out Justine.,Neutral
"And I decide to takea little bit of a walk,",Neutral
'cause Survivor. Why not?,Neutral
Got nothing else to do.,Neutral
"Plus, it'd be niceto have an idol.",Neutral
My eyes are peeled.,Neutral
I think I'm goodat that kind of stuff.,Happiness

Easter egg hunting as a kid.I was a legend at it.,Happiness
Just bird doo-doo.,Disgust
But this looks easier on TV.,Surprise
That's for sure.,Neutral
I haven't looked for an idolbecause I believe that,neutral
that is a kiss of death.,Fear
"But we'regoing to Tribal Council,",Fear
and that changes everything.,Neutral
"I'm walking around forever,and I'm finding nothing.",Sadness
"And I'm about to say""to hell with it.""",Anger
"And then I walk up to this,like, stump,",Neutral
and bingo. I got it.,Happiness
"And I was like, ""Holy moly.""",Surprise
I was so stoked.,happiness
"I saw season 41 and 42,",Neutral
"but the L-I-V-I-N that wastattooed on me is in my blood,",Neutral
"so, like, the ""beware"" part,like, it didn't even exist.",Surprise
"Like, I just said, ""Open it.""",Neutral
"Tonight was a slam dunk,",happiness
"we were ready to rock,and now",Neutral
this leaves both me and Dwightwithout a vote.,Neutral
"So, Justine and Noelleare voting for Nneka.",Neutral
And Nneka and Jessewill be voting for Justine.,Neutral
Tie. Fantastic.,Happiness
... just got crazy.,Surprise
"Opening up the Beware Advantagewas a huge mistake,",regret
because if I don't geta specific bead,Neutral

a discussion about whetheror not there's other advantages,Neutral

"Should I use thisagainst Karla tonight?""",Neutral
I have to,Neutral
do something about this.,Neutral

I think Geo'sthe best move right now.,Neutral
"I know it's scary,but that's the game.",fear
"I thought we had itlocked in, but my alliance",neutral
got spooked at the last minute.,fear
"They're like,""Just trust me. Vote Geo,""",Neutral
"but I know I'm getting votes,",Happiness

We have to take this shot.,Neutral
They're going after me.We all know that.,Fear
"If it was one of y'all'sname on the line,",Neutral
you'd also have concerns,Fear

Me and Karla want to vote Geo.,Neutral
Cassidy wants to vote Ryan.,Neutral
She's just worriedthat votes are coming her way.,Fear
Why are people so afraid?,Fear
"- We have numbers.Like, it's a numbers game.- I know.",Neutral

I-I hope it'snot a Lindsay number two.,Fear
We're so closeto the freaking merge.,Happiness
"Me and Karlaare sitting there like, ""Yo,",neutral
we've had the same exact talkwith Lindsay,Neutral
"at the same exact place.""",Neutral
She got paranoid and thereforeshe got voted out.,fear
"And we thoughtCass was a cool customer,",neutral
but it'sthe exact same situation.,Neutral
"It's very easy to say,""Sorry, Cass, you can just go,""",Neutral
"but I also feel likeGeo does have an advantage,",neutral
"and I'm like, ""That's dangerousto keep in the game.""",fear
So I hadto figure out the best move,Neutral
for me and Karla moving forward.,Neutral
"All right, here'smy first question, Cassidy.",Neutral
Can you feel momentum?,Neutral
"Like, if you're at a sportingevent and you feel it shift.",Neutral
Or is momentummerely a state of mind?,Neutral
"You know, I dobelieve in momentum. I think",neutral
we had good momentumcoming into this game.,Happiness
"It shifted a little bit,",Neutral
but that doesn't mean thatit can't change on a dime,Neutral
"and shift back into our favor,",Neutral
and that's reallywhat I'm hoping for,happiness
after this Tribal Council.,Neutral
"Ryan, what'syour take on momentum?",Neutral
"Um, I would have to sayit's a group effort.",neutral
"It's synergy,a way to move together.",Neutral
"And we had it inthe beginning of this challenge,",Neutral
"but at the end of it,as an individual,",neutral
I think I dropped the ball--,Sadness
"quite literally,with this challenge.",Neutral
"Let's talk about thatfor a second,",Neutral
"because in a challengelike today,",Neutral
"where there wereso many layers to it,",Neutral
- Yeah.- is it fair to put the blame,Neutral
on the person wholiterally dropped the ball?,Neutral
"You know, I told them, ""Hey, ifmy name needs to go out there,",neutral
"""you know, I'm ready for it,",neutral
"as long as it keeps you guysstrong through the merge.""",Neutral
"And I'll look backover my shoulder, if it is me,",Neutral
and I'll give them a smile.,Happiness
"I don't have any hate,no animosity.",Neutral
I just want to enjoy my timein Fiji as best as I can.,happiness
"Cassidy, how wasthat information received?",Neutral
"I mean, it's interesting because",neutral
"for somebody to come in and beso like, ""It's okay if it's me.",Neutral
"I just wantwhat's best for the tribe.""",Neutral
That's just not normallythe type of game that you see.,Neutral
"And, I mean,I respect it if that's",neutral
the way thathe wants to play his game.,Neutral
"Um, I just don't know if Iwould have done the same thing.",Neutral
"So, Ryan, is thereany concern that",fear
"putting the sword right hereand saying, ""If you want me",Neutral
"to fall on it, I will,""that they'll just push you?",Fear
"Um, yeah, but I thinkstaying true to myself, like,",neutral
"I've always been a giver,",Neutral
and going out as a giverisn't something I'm ashamed of.,happiness
"So, Karla, is therepart of you just thinking,",Neutral
"""I'm sharpening my knife, right?He's made it so easy.",Anger
"- He's going to lie down for me.""- Of course.",Neutral
You just want it to be easy.,Neutral
"I think an easy, an easy vote",Neutral
"- doesn't complicate things,especially at Tribal.- Mm.",Neutral
"And I can't imagine howGeo feels just coming back,",neutral
"and, like, justgetting all this information.",Neutral
"So, yeah, like, part of mejust is ready with the knives.",Anger
"Like, why not?",Neutral
"All right, Geo,so you're not there",Sadness
"for thisearly discussion, where...",neutral
I'm tryingto catch up right now.,Neutral
"I'm like, ""What's going on?""",Surprise
- Are you really?- Yes.,Neutral
"So then, what are youfeeling right now?",neutral
- Are you solid or uneasy?- Um...,Neutral
I'm uneasy because I wasn't partof many of these conversations,fear
that probably happenedback in camp.,Neutral
I just wantto make sure I vote,Neutral
"at the right direction,'cause if I'm voting against",neutral
"all the votes, then allthe votes might be on me,",Neutral
"and I might bethe next person going home,",fear
and I'm not tryingto go home tonight.,Neutral
"James, did you ask Geo",Neutral
- what happened on the journey?- We didn't have to ask Geo.,Neutral
Geo came and-andjust told us what happened.,Surprise
"I mean, I feel like that's thebest way to move in this game,",neutral
because keepingthe information flowing,Neutral
"amongst each other,especially when we're",neutral
going to be competing soonin a merge.,Neutral
"So, Geo, how do youuse Tribal right now",Neutral
to try to make sureyou're okay?,Neutral
"You just said, ""I don'teven know who to vote for.""",Neutral
"Well, you're scaring the crapout of me right now,",fear
"like, telling me all this stuff.",Neutral
"- Wait, you've watched Survivor before, right?- But... I know.",Neutral
Yes.,Neutral
This is not new.,Neutral
"But at this point,it's critical for me to hear",Neutral
"everything and see everyone'sfaces when they're talking,",Neutral
'cause you don't knowwho's telling the truth.,fear
"I really don't know what to do,but I'm just gonna trust my gut",neutral
and hope that I canbe on the right side tonight.,Neutral
"Karla, is it possiblethat Geo's telling the truth",Neutral
and that he really doesn't know,Neutral
what the four of you aretalking about and planning?,Neutral
"Yes. Uh, sorry. I'm...",Neutral
I'm listening to the answersand internalizing it.,Neutral
I just hope that if anyonewould have gone on a journey,Neutral
"and come straight to Tribal,that they really trust",Neutral
"in their alliance,because that's really, I think,",neutral
the way thatyou will survive Tribal.,Neutral
"So, Ryan, as weget ready for the vote,",neutral
"if you're voted out tonight,is your story gonna be,",Neutral
"""Hey, man, I put myselfin the money position.",Happiness
"I didn't deliver. Theyvoted me out, and that's fair.""",sadness
I-I guess that's whatI'm gonna have to go home with.,Sadness
I feel more of the factof keeping the people,Neutral
that I care about as unified aspossible as I walk out the door.,Neutral
"So if people write your namedown, would you like them",Neutral
"to put, like,a little smiley face?",Happiness
I would like them to say,Neutral
what they liked most about meto that camera.,Neutral
- That's how I would...- Okay.,Neutral
"I never know what the truth is,",confusion
but you've pitched itpretty hard,Neutral
"that you're a kindhearted soul,",happiness
and you just want to play,Neutral
"the game with love,whether that means",neutral
you're out tonight oryou're there at the final three.,Neutral
"It's just, uh,kill 'em with kindness.",Neutral
It's what's been in my bloodsince the day I was born.,Neutral
"Cassidy, if you surviveand the vote goes the way",Neutral
"you want it to go,how will the tribe be different?",Neutral
"Um, I thinkwe'll be more unified.",Happiness
I think with each vote,Neutral
"in the right direction,you can kind of trust",Neutral
your alliesa little bit more each time.,Neutral
And so I thinkit'll only strengthen,Neutral
"my alliance,going into the merge.",Neutral
"All right, it is time to vote.Geo, you're up.",Neutral
"I'm sure you're amazing,but you have to go.",Neutral
"You think you can play me,but the truth is",anger
I'm the one thatput the blanks in your gun.,Anger

Because you're one of the sixthat's in trouble.,Fear
"Honestly, as soon aswe lost the challenge,",sadness
all I could think aboutwas how scary it is,fear
to be vulnerableversus being safe.,Neutral
It gets to the point whereevery conversation that,Neutral
"you have with somebody, everylook that you give somebody,",Neutral
"it really matters,",neutral
"because it gets back to you,at some point.",Neutral
"- Cassidy,you were nodding.- Yeah, it's true.",neutral
And it's hard to knowwhat dynamics,Neutral

"person's point of view,and it gets very complicated.",Neutral
Yeah. Everybody'sgot their own mission.,Neutral
Everybody's got theirown goals and their checklist.,Neutral
And so today was no different.,Neutral

"Wow. So, Owen,",Neutral
is it that tightthat you really have to decide,Neutral
where you're gonnaspend your time?,Neutral
"Right. Trust is the onlycurrency we have out here,",Neutral
and that'sthe beauty of Survivor,happiness
is that you cannever trust anyone 100%.,Sadness
We can only trust ourselves,Neutral
in trying to figure outwho trusts me.,Neutral

is the masterful pieceof Survivor.,Happiness
"And if you play 'em wrong,",Neutral
you've got bad jewelryto go home with.,Disgust
"So, Sami,it sounds like there were",neutral
"at least some discussionswhere people said,",neutral
"""So-and-so might have this,""",Neutral
"or ""So-and-so has this""or ""I have this.""",Neutral
"- Were you a part of that?- Yeah, and I think",Neutral
"one of the moreimportant things is, like,",neutral
"the way that those advantagesand idols are played,",Neutral
"whether they're playedthe right way or not,",neutral
"can change the way that peopleview an alliance, you know?",Neutral
If you said you had somebody'sback and they went on ahead,Neutral
"and played an advantageor an idol or something,",Neutral
what does that tell youas a person in a group?,Neutral
That tells youthey didn't really,Neutral
come in here trusting you.,Neutral
"James, couldn't have said itbetter than what Sami just said,",Neutral
"and yet,it doesn't solve anything,",neutral
"because ifyou think you got to play it,",neutral
"you got to play it, becauseyou got to get to tomorrow.",Neutral
"For me, I'm just like,""Hey, I trust the people that",neutral
"I've talked to,and it makes pragmatic sense.""",Neutral
"The vote I'm gonna make tonight,",neutral
"just tryingto not flunk kindergarten, Jeff,",neutral
and move forward.,Neutral
"Jeanine, if you look at whatSami's saying a different way,",neutral
he might really be sayingthat sometimes a big move,Neutral
is to not make the big move.,Neutral
"If you're right,it can lock you like this.",Fear
"If you're wrong, your torchis here and you're gone.",Anger
This is a gameof paranoia versus gut.,Fear
"And the differenceis paranoia is very present,",fear
and gut is the abilityto latch on to things,Neutral
that are behind you that,Neutral
"you can look back on and say,""My gut instinct is that",neutral
"that relationshipin the past worked,""",Neutral
"or, you know,""I can trust that person.""",Neutral
And it's not justso caught up in the momentary,Neutral
feeling of what you shouldbe doing right then and there.,neutral

That's the route that Noellehas sort of charted for us.,Neutral
What are you hearing?,Neutral

I go to Karla.I genuinely trust Karla,Happiness
more than I trust Noelleright now. Like...,Neutral

"He thinks, instead of Noelle,we should go after Dwight.",Neutral
- Dwight's alsovery good at this game.- Yeah.,Neutral
He's done the puzzles.He's done all kinds of good ...,happiness
"That's notpersonally what I want,",Neutral
but if I'm ableto take out Dwight,Neutral
"and weaken Noelle,that's fine with me.",Neutral
"And it also gives Cody,like, a sense of agency, right?",Neutral
"Like, you don't wantto strip people",Neutral
of their agency in this game.,Neutral
It's gonna be a tough one.,Fear
Yeah.,Neutral
We're exploring the optionof making a move already now,Neutral
and joining with Cocoagainst Dwight and Noelle.,Neutral
But Noelle...,Neutral
This is a movethat's going to really,neutral
make things a little crazy.,Neutral
Is it too soon?,Neutral
"It could be,",neutral
"but no matter what,",neutral
Jesse and I are gonnabe on the same page.,Neutral

"if I'm successful,I have a huge target on my back.",Fear
"Then, if I'm wrong,I'm definitely going home.",Fear
I got Geo'sKnowledge Is Power right now.,happiness
But using the Knowledge IsPower to gain trust is very key.,Neutral

"Let's work together.""",Neutral
"I trust you, and...",Neutral

It may be time to vote him out.,Neutral
Because now he is the mostdangerous player out here.,Fear
"So, if for some reason",Neutral
he would takemy immunity bracelet tonight...,Fear
...I've given itto Jesse because,Neutral
I feel it's safer with himthan with me at this time.,fear
"We don't know what it is,",neutral
"but it could beanother merge advantage,",Neutral
- like we've seenthe past two seasons.- Yeah.,Neutral
"It's probablyKnowledge Is Power, so...",neutral
"- We're just... Yeah.- We're trying to, like,transfer everything around",Neutral
to make sure Jameswill never guess who has what.,Neutral
"- Yeah. Yeah.- We don't knowwhat the advantage is,",neutral
so we're reallypreparing for it to be anything.,Neutral
"But, in the eventthat it's Knowledge Is Power,",neutral
"we already have a planset in place where,",neutral
"to cover our butts,",Neutral
we will do cross-tribe switches.,Neutral
It feels scaryto hand over my idol,fear
when that is the one pieceof power I have right now.,Neutral
"- Okay.- Of course, you know, I'llgive it right back to you...",Neutral
"Oh, no, of course. No, yeah,of course. I trust you.",Neutral

Noelle gave meher Steal a Vote in case,Neutral
James had foundKnowledge Is Power.,Happiness
"So we playeda little musical chairs,",happiness
"a little shell game,to try to cover it up.",Disgust
"And then, on top of all that,",Neutral
"we're trying to, like,figure out who to vote out.",Neutral
So there are a lot of thingsthat could go wrong tonight.,Fear
There's so much that'sscary about tonight's vote.,fear
"There's the easy routewhere, you know,",neutral
"I just stick with the plan,and we take out James tonight.",Neutral
"The more risky route is thatme and Cody flip our votes,",fear
"and we take out Dwight tonight,",Neutral
"and we turn our back on Vesi,",Neutral
and it's officiallyVesi no more.,Sadness
"In this game there'sthis question of timing, right?",Neutral
"Like, you don't want to makea big move too soon, but also,",neutral
"like, you don't wantto play somebody else's game.",neutral
"But now we'rein the stage of the game where,",neutral
"like, legends are madeor you flame out.",Neutral
"So, like, it's big. This isthe big league, so I'm ready.",happiness
All right.,Neutral
"So, todaythe challenge was designed",Neutral
to really illustratethis idea of earning it,Neutral
every single step of the way.,Neutral
"Karla, you'vebeen banged up a lot.",Neutral
Did you feelthat was a representation,Neutral
of how difficult it really is,Neutral
just to surviveone day out here?,Fear
"Uh, I mean, of course.",Neutral
"The first stage was the hardest,",Fear
"and I feel like that wasour experience, at least for me,",Neutral
- the first five dayswere the hardest.- Mm.,Neutral
And then you getto the second stage,Neutral
"and you're kind of like,""I-I got the hang of this.""",happiness
"But I could see thenthe third stage was like,",Neutral
"""Oh, no, you got to hold on,""because you don't know",fear
how long you haveuntil you're gone.,Sadness
"So, Jesse, y'all getback to camp. What happens?",Neutral
"I think we're at this, like,different stage of the game.",Neutral
"Earlier stage of the game,",Neutral
we're going to Tribalwith six people.,Neutral
"It's, like,almost like practice.",Neutral
"And now we're, like, inthe Colosseum, and we're like...",surprise
There weredefinitely talks happening.,Neutral
"Dwight,I have not heard any talk",Neutral
"about what I observed,which was this sort of",neutral
Baka-Vesi versus Coco,Neutral
or maybe helping each other.,Neutral
It was talked about at oneof the challenges at the end.,Neutral
Did that just fall outonce you all got together?,Surprise
"Yeah, you know,we all have the same color Buff.",Neutral
We're all representing ourselvesat this point in the game.,Neutral
"There's no more, like, indication",Neutral
"of Vesi, Baka, Coco here.",Neutral
That was in the past.,Neutral
Let's move forwardas individuals,Neutral
and play our own games.,Happiness
"Noelle, what talk is there,at this stage,",Neutral
about advantages or idolsthat could be in the game?,Neutral
"Going into Tribal Council,if you're not thinking",neutral
"someone has something, thenit's probably you going home.",Neutral
You have to always be on yourfeet about that kind of stuff.,Neutral
You don't want someonegoing home on your alliance,Neutral
because someone elseplayed an idol or an advantage.,Neutral
"You have to have plan A,",Neutral
"plan B, plan Cand plan D, just in case.",Neutral
"So, James,this idea of plan A, plan B,",Neutral
"plan C, plan D,",Neutral
does that go throughyour head all the time?,Neutral
"I mean, you still haveto weigh each relationship",Neutral
"with what they're saying,and does the actual actions,",Neutral
"uh, back upwhat's being said at Tribal?",Surprise
So advantages are great.Idols are great.,Happiness
"At the same time, you haveto know when to use them.",Neutral
"You have to know,if you have an idol,",Neutral
know if you're in trouble.,Fear
"To use certain advantages,",Neutral
you have to havecertain knowledge.,Neutral
So a lot of peoplehave played advantages,Neutral
wrong and to their detriment.,Anger
So you can't sit backand just be worried,Fear
about advantages 24/7.,Neutral
You can drive yourself crazy.,Neutral
What you can dois find a group of people,Neutral
"that you build trust with,that give you a logical plan,",Neutral
and you kind of stick to it.,Neutral
"Cody, give us a surfing analogy.",Neutral
You're gonna gosurfing for the day.,Happiness

and the beersand the umbrellas hanging out.,Neutral
"You know, it's that decisionof, are you gonna jump in",Neutral
and play this gameand really go for it?,Neutral
Or maybe just hang outa little bit longer,Neutral

So it's a little bit like Jaws.,Neutral
You knowthere's a shark somewhere.,Fear
But we haven't seen it yet.,Neutral

Everyone seems scared,fear

"No, no, no, no, no, no.",Anger
I might actuallyhave to trust James.,Fear
"But I'm readyto fight for my game,",Anger
so sometimesyou have to rock the boat.,Neutral
"Like, this is a cutthroat game.",Neutral
"All right, let's startwith a big topic.",Neutral
Every season of Survivorhas a unique social contract,Neutral
"that is established,",neutral
"designed, builtand executed by the players.",Neutral
"You all decide,""Okay, here are the rules.""",Neutral
"So, Gabler,does this group have a sense",Neutral
of what the establishedsocial contract is?,Neutral
"I think so, Jeff.",Neutral
"It's been a relationship game,",neutral
"and when you stepoutside of that, especially",Neutral
"if you're starting to gettoo aggressive with gameplay,",anger
you kind ofget cracked into line.,Neutral
So it has to be subtle.,Neutral
"And with every Tribal Council,we learn a lot more",Neutral
about those social constructs,Neutral
and those borders andwhere they're gonna be crossed.,Neutral
"Karla, do you agreewith Gabler's assessment?",Neutral
"I do agree thatthere is some subtlety,",Neutral
"but at the same time, you can'tbe subtle the entire time.",Neutral
"You know? Like,",neutral
how will people knowwhat moves you're making?,Neutral
How will the juryknow who to vote for?,Neutral
"Ryan, does thisline up with the way",Neutral
you're seeing the gameplay?,Neutral
"I think, this season,we're comfortable enough to say,",Neutral
"""Hey, let's slow down, andwe'll get to playing the game.""",Neutral
"But right now, a lot of people",Neutral
are trying to step backand enjoy what's around them,Happiness
and enjoy the experiencethey're having.,happiness
"So, Owen,that begs the question,",Neutral
are people staying in linebecause you all,Neutral
actually sharethe same philosophy?,Neutral
"Or is the player saying,",Neutral
"""I'm reading the room.I need to just lay low""?",Neutral
"I think, truthfully,it's more of the latter.",Neutral
I don't think all of us areout swimming for three hours,Neutral
"the way Ryan is, necessarily.",Neutral
"But foolishly,last Tribal Council,",neutral

"But at the same time, the lasttwo people that went home",Neutral

"And so, there's a lot of game",Neutral
"being played, a lotof conversations being had.",Neutral
Everybody that's sitting hereis playing this game.,Neutral
Everybody's just playingit a little bit differently.,Neutral
"Cassidy, do you likethe way this game is playing?",Neutral
"Yeah, I mean, for me,",Neutral
"my gameplay ismaybe a little bit more subtle,",neutral
"but that doesn't mean that I'mnot making big moves, you know?",Neutral
It's just aboutkeeping trust with the people,Neutral
that I want to work with.,Neutral
"How about you, James?",Neutral
"Last Tribal,there were a lot of lines",Neutral
"that may have been drawn,",Neutral
"but each daya new line can be drawn,",Neutral
and you'retrying to make sure,Neutral
that you're drawing the properline for you to move forward.,Neutral
"Jeanine, James just said it.",neutral
The thing thatreally complicates,Neutral
these Survivor societiesis that they're fluid.,Neutral
So how do you play this gameknowing that what was,Confusion
"true yesterday,or even this morning,",Neutral
"may not be trueright now, this evening?",Neutral
"Yeah. Like we've allbeen talking about,",neutral
"there has beena culture established,",neutral
but just as much asit was easy for us to all,Neutral
"kind of opt into that culture,it could change and shift.",Neutral
And you have to understandwhen that's happening,Neutral
and go with the momentum there.,Neutral
"Gabler, what do you do",Neutral
"when you talk to two people,and they say, ""Plan A,""",neutral
"and you talk to two more people,and they go,",Neutral
"""No, no, we're doing plan B.""",Neutral
"Oh, well, that's...that was my day.",Neutral
"I mean, it's beenplan A, plan B,",Neutral
"plan A for sure, back to B.",Neutral
It's bounced arounda little bit.,Neutral
"So, yeah, tonight'sgonna be interesting.",Neutral
I think it's gonnaput a little bit more,Neutral
into focus for tomorrow.,Neutral
"Cody, when you feel comfortable,",neutral
does that make you more nervousthat you're feeling comfortable?,Fear
I get more nervouswhen I'm comfortable.,Fear
"And, for example,when we got back today,",neutral
"I'm thinking,we're starting the rice.",Neutral

"And I'm sitting by the firepit,",neutral
