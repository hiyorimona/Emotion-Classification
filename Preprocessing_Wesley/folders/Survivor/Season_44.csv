and then we'll go.",neutral
"All right, it is time to get",neutral
"to the final Tribal Council
of Survivor 44.",neutral
"Social, physical, strategy.",neutral
It's fine if we overlap.,neutral
"Kane, get us started.",neutral
"- (whoops) (chuckles) Let's go.
- (laughter)",happiness
"Uh, first off,
I want you guys to know",neutral
"that we are
all very proud of you.",happiness
"I think
every single person here,",neutral
their vote is up in the air.,neutral
"So for me to vote for you,",neutral
"you need
to explain your game to me,",neutral
"and then you need to
convince me that it is better,",neutral
"unapologetically,
than the other two people.",neutral
"So my first question to you
is what do you think",neutral
"our perception of you is
and do you think it's accurate?",neutral
"- Yam Yam.
- YAM YAM: What do I think",neutral
it is your perception of me?,neutral
"I think you love me, of course.",happiness
(laughing),happiness
"I believe that
all of you perceive me",neutral
"as a happy-go-lucky person,
which I am.",happiness
"I believe all of you
perceive me as someone",neutral
"that loves this game and love to
make moves, which is also true.",happiness
"What I think
the biggest perception of me,",neutral
"which I think
is the wrong perception,",neutral
"is that I was following
Carson's steps all the way.",neutral
"Carson and I did an alliance
day three with Carolyn,",neutral
"and the perception was,
like, we were a disaster.",sadness
"But we know
what was the target every time.",neutral
"- Carolyn also had...
- Can I say something within that?",neutral
"Towards the beginning
of the merge,",neutral
"you guys were kind of riding
a little bit of...",neutral
"- It wasn't like that.
- The wave of the, of the Soka members.",neutral
"It wasn't like that. That's what
we wanted you to perceive.",surprise
"We wanted you to perceive
that we were willing",neutral
"to go with the target
that you chose.",neutral
Oh.,Neutral
"So I knew
every single people's vote,",neutral
every time we go to Tribal.,neutral
Heidi.,neutral
"So, how do I think
you perceive me? Right?",neutral
"I think it probably varies
throughout the entire game.",neutral
"When we started the merge,
I think the perception",neutral
"was that I was
very much into the strategy.",neutral
"Then when I got
into the hole that I lost",sadness
"some of my Soka numbers,
it probably was like,",neutral
"""Well, Heidi's
no longer strategic.",disgust
"""She's just
riding everyone's tail",anger
"because she has to survive.""",neutral
"But within that hole,
I really was trying my best",sadness
to still be strategic.,neutral
"I tried to really
integrate a little bit",neutral
"of my social game
to get to where I was.",neutral
"And at the very end,
which happened yesterday,",neutral
"I used everything I could
to put myself",sadness
"in the best position, so I could
have a good speech to give you.",happiness
"- Okay, Carolyn.
- Carolyn.",neutral
"So right away, I didn't fit in.",sadness
"I was a little quirky
and different, and...",neutral
and then I found Carson.,surprise
"And we connected
over genuine realness",happiness
"and him saying, you know,
""I was that quirky kid,""",neutral
and that was day one.,neutral
"And then I found you,
and I said,",happiness
"""How in the heck
did he get on my tribe?""",surprise
"(laughing) - Because we are
so similar, and he is so much,",happiness
"- and I am so much, too.
- Girl.",neutral
"But as far as perceptions go,
I know that I was",neutral
"looked at as, like,
""Girl, like, who is this?""",surprise
"And I was underestimated
this entire game.",anger
"I was playing,",neutral
"but I was so underestimated
that sometimes",sadness
"it kind of played into itself,
if that makes sense.",neutral
"CARSON: And I just want to
give you and Yam Yam props.",happiness
"You were able to evolve yourself
and make those relationships,",happiness
"and that's what I'm impressed
with both of you about.",surprise
"And, Heidi, I didn't
get to really know your game,",neutral
"'cause I didn't
play with you as long,",sadness
"but I'd love
to hear your own gameplay",happiness
"and your own social
relationships you built, too.",neutral
"Yeah, so we had four Soka
members going into the merge,",neutral
"but the players that I was with,
we all got targets right away",neutral
"'cause we were all
strong in some capacity.",neutral
"I mean, the difference
between their game and mine",neutral
is they were on a high.,happiness
"I suffered
through a heck of a lot,",sadness
"and that's
the reality of our games.",neutral
Very different games.,neutral
"And we all, the three of us,
I'm proud to say,",happiness
"we made it here
in very different ways.",neutral
"We were not always in a high,",neutral
"and we took advantage
of not being in a high.",neutral
"We took advantage
of the perception",neutral
"that you were saving us,",neutral
and we were saving ourselves.,neutral
"But you can see how
Carson is defending you because.",neutral
"- Carson was a lot of the brains behind that, though.
- YAM YAM: I was gonna get there.",neutral
"- I was gonna get there.
- Okay.",neutral
"DANNY: But with all due
respect, I'll tell you right now,",neutral
"I played my game
compartmentalized, and I take",neutral
"pride in that, and I have
so much respect for this game,",happiness
"if my mother was up there
and she had a bad pitch,",sadness
she's not getting my vote.,anger
"So what I want to hear is
how did you guys use Carson?",neutral
"'Cause I'm sure
that nothing you guys did",neutral
was just going with it.,neutral
"I used Carson
to get a lot of information,",neutral
"but I did that
with a lot of you guys.",neutral
"It wasn't only with Carson,
and I got to eat...",neutral
"- (laughter)
- because Carson took me.",happiness
"And that was no mistake
on my part, you know?",neutral
"But it's not a thing like,
""I use Carson for this.""",neutral
"I use everyone.
And that speaks to my game.",neutral
"They should have been coming
for me, and they didn't.",sadness
"Well, your name was
written several times,",neutral
"and you said you had to survive the
first few Tribals, -It was, it was, it was.",neutral
"- So...
- That's right.",neutral
"I thought that was
because I'm pretty.",neutral
(laughing),happiness
"DANNY: And, Heidi,
for you, who did you use",neutral
"to propel your game,
as kind of, like, a shield",neutral
to move yourself forward?,neutral
Thank you for the question.,happiness
"I think the answer, it's you,",neutral
"'cause I truly thought
we could work together,",sadness
"and we did
for almost the entire game.",neutral
"And I knew you look
physically more fit than I do,",neutral
"so I knew you will
have a bigger target than me.",neutral
"So, did I use you as a shield?",surprise
"100%. 100%, I did.
But that doesn't take away from",neutral
"the friendship that we created
throughout the game.",happiness
"Yeah, of course. But, yeah,
it makes sense. Perfect.",neutral
"FRANNIE:
Um, I love all the strategy,",happiness
"like, love the numbers, but
I feel like there's a lot more",surprise
"- to dig into with, like, social.
- Mm-hmm. - Right.",neutral
"- Yeah.
- So, one thing that we talk about and think about",neutral
"a lot in this game
is emotions, right?",neutral
"And on one end,
there is an emotional player,",neutral
"and on the other end, there is",neutral
"an intellectual,
strategic player.",neutral
"And you can use both
effectively in this game.",neutral
"So I want to understand
from each of you how you managed",neutral
"your emotions, how you saw them
as a strength or a weakness.",neutral
"And I would
love Carolyn to start,",neutral
"because you've been so open
about saying that you are",neutral
"an emotional person
and an emotional player.",neutral
"I'm gonna get emotional.
(chuckles)",neutral
"- Good. Good.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.",neutral
"When you're actively addicted,",sadness
you hold things in.,neutral
I didn't express myself.,neutral
"I didn't know
how to express myself.",sadness
"I didn't know
what emotions were.",neutral
"I learned that all
going through treatment.",sadness
So there's that spectrum,neutral
"of you're either strategic
or you're emotional.",neutral
"You can't be both.
There is no in between.",neutral
"And honestly,
I just didn't want to do that,",neutral
"because, to me,
it was way too painful",sadness
to go there and numb that.,neutral
"Yes, there were times
where I knew that",neutral
"they're gonna expect me
to be emotional right now,",neutral
"because I cry
when I eat a papaya.",sadness
"We get rice, I'm crying.",happiness
"You give me a hug, I'm crying.",sadness
"I'm so grateful.
That was all real.",happiness
"But I know
that there were moments",neutral
"where I needed
people to trust me.",sadness
"I knew I needed to fake those
tears, and then compose myself.",neutral
It wasn't always easy for me.,sadness
PROBST: Yam Yam.,neutral
"So, emotions,",Neutral
"which I have,
I have many emotions.",neutral
"My happiness, my love, my care,
how do I use this in my favor?",happiness
"And I don't want to,
like, offend anybody",neutral
"on the conversations
that I had were real,",neutral
"but some of you were very
blank when I would talk to you.",neutral
"Jaime, for example,
was super blank.",neutral
Brandon was super blank to me.,neutral
"- Kane is still like that, you know?
- (laughter)",happiness
But how did I knew,surprise
"if you guys were
telling me the truth or not?",surprise
"I would take my time
to build real relationship",neutral
"with each of you
and see how your eye twinkle",happiness
"when you're talking about
your loved one, or your eye",happiness
"twinkle when you're talking
about food or about your work.",happiness
"So when you guys
were lying to me",anger
"or not telling me the truth,
that twinkle went away.",sadness
"So I use your emotions
and your facial expressions",neutral
that I knew were real,neutral
"and compared them
to when they were not real.",neutral
"And that's why I'm so
successful working with people.",happiness
"I'm there working
with 25 crazies,",anger
"so I'm, like, right at home
when I was next to her.",happiness
But in all the best way.,happiness
"And it was hard. It was scary.
I was like...",fear
"(sharp inhale) ""Can I do this
in English? Let's see.""",neutral
"But that's how
I use emotions in my favor...",neutral
"Not only my emotions,",neutral
"but how I use your emotions
to know what was going on.",neutral
Amazing.,happiness
PROBST: Heidi.,surprise
"I'm glad
you asked that question,",happiness
"because I-I really
want to explain myself,",neutral
"and I'm gonna get
to the emotions with this,",neutral
"but the why I'm in Survivor,
why I'm here is",neutral
"I want to represent people
that sound different,",neutral
that look different.,neutral
"I want to represent
girls out there that want",neutral
"to be in science
and want to be different.",neutral
"Right? And with that comes
a whole lot of responsibilities.",neutral
"Being Latina in science,
I work with all guys,",neutral
so I have to keep my composure.,neutral
"And I have learned
to control my emotions",neutral
to be successful at what I do.,neutral
"So I feel like I have been
in the spectrum of emotions,",neutral
"but I have tried to control it,",neutral
"so I can still
represent the best way I can",neutral
"for the people that I want
to show that they can do this.",happiness
"LAUREN: And I want to say
thank you so much for sharing that.",happiness
"And I definitely saw
you controlling your emotions,",neutral
"and that made you continue on
throughout the game.",neutral
"- Thank you.
- LAUREN: You know, and you just",neutral
"externalize it or internalize
it differently than the others.",neutral
"Um, I just want to, like,
slide one little thing in.",neutral
"This is less of a question than
it is just, like, a statement.",neutral
"Um, something I admire
about all of you is you guys",neutral
"did a really good job of being
yourselves out here. All of you.",happiness
"- Thank you.
- MATT: Big personalities.","- neutral
- neutral"
"You shared with all of us,
and that's really hard for me.",sadness
"And I'm, like, so happy
that you get this platform",happiness
"to, like, really,
really show off who you are.",neutral
"- That's all I wanted to say.
- Thank you. It's a hot seat, though.",neutral
"- It is, but... (laughs)
- HEIDI: But thank you.",happiness
"- We love you.
- PROBST: All right.",happiness
"Who wants to get us into
the physical part of this game?",surprise
"Uh, I just want to talk quickly
about the challenges.",neutral
"You know, I think you all know
that I had a lot of fun",happiness
"with the challenges,
and I was just curious",curiosity
"how you thought you would come
in and perform in challenges.",neutral
"And I'll start with Carolyn,
'cause you've been",neutral
"so open about
your challenge performance",neutral
"- that I just want to give you a chance to speak.
- Here I am.",neutral
"- (laughing)
- Yeah, um,",neutral
"well, first off, let me say,",neutral
"I'm an athletic person
in real life,",neutral
"so I'm not joking...
I thought I would do great.",surprise
"And it was, like,",neutral
"one embarrassing thing
happened after the other.",sadness
"Like, I got stuck
in a spiderweb,",disgust
and so it was just humiliating.,sadness
"And I hear your voice, Jeff,
and I had to tune you out,",anger
"but I needed to hear it,
like, ""Keep going!""",happiness
"And I'm like, ""I know.""
And then I got my letter.",surprise
"""Mom, I hope
you're winning challenges.""",happiness
"It broke my heart reading that,
and it was so hard.",sadness
It was so hard.,sadness
"To see myself,
like, failing at them.",sadness
"But then, at the same time,
I promised my son I wouldn't",sadness
"talk poorly about myself,
because that's what I teach him",sadness
is positive self-talk.,neutral
So all I could do is just accept,sadness
"that I'm not at that level,
and it's okay.",neutral
"PROBST: And, Carolyn,
I just want to say, -Amen.",happiness
I never see it as humiliating.,neutral
"I see somebody
giving everything they have.",neutral
And anybody who sits at home,neutral
"and talks smack
about you and the spiderweb",anger
"- should come out here and apply to be on Survivor.
- (all agreeing)",happiness
"Instead of sitting
on your couch talking smack.",anger
(laughing),happiness
"- YAM YAM: Yes.
- PROBST: It's not easy.",neutral
"HEIDI: Seeing Carolyn
trying inspired me,",happiness
"and I want to use it
to inspire my kids.",happiness
"Like, this is what you do.",neutral
"You-you are not gonna
be good at certain things.",sadness
"You might struggle
with certain things,",sadness
but you keep trying.,neutral
"And she's still here
in the top three.",surprise
"- So props to you, because you inspire me.
- Thank you.","- Happiness
- Neutral"
Thank you.,happiness
"CARSON: And, Heidi,
let's dig into day 25,",neutral
"where you not only won immunity,",happiness
but you put yourself,neutral
"in a vulnerable position
to make fire.",neutral
"- HEIDI: Yeah.
- Even though you didn't have to.",neutral
"But I want you
to talk about that,",neutral
"because that was part
of your physical game.",neutral
"Yeah.
So, thank you for the question,",neutral
"and I'm so proud
I pulled through that one.",happiness
"And I think I was perceived as,
""She had a good game,",neutral
"""but she doesn't
have this in the bag."" Right?",doubt
"I think if I didn't
go for fire yesterday,",neutral
"I would have
never won this game.",sadness
"And not that
I'm saying I'm winning,",neutral
"but it gives me
the best opportunity",happiness
"to plead my case here,",neutral
"because I truly think
Carson was very much",neutral
"the brains of what was
happening with a lot of this.",neutral
So I had to make a big move.,neutral
"And it so happened
that it happened on day 25.",neutral
"And not only did you just make
fire when you didn't have to,",surprise
"you made fire the fastest
in the history of Survivor.",surprise
"That I didn't expect,",surprise
"but if that's
a record or whatever,",neutral
"I take it, because
this game is amazing.",happiness
"And I'll put a plug that maybe
we can make history today,",happiness
"because
if you vote for me to win,",neutral
"I will be the oldest
female contestant winner.",happiness
"- CARSON: Wow.
- So we can make even more history together.",surprise
"- (laughing)
- Vote for me.","- happiness
- neutral"
"- But thank you for the question.
- CARSON: Yeah.",neutral
"And, you know, Yam Yam
and Heidi, you made it through",happiness
"a lot of challenges
that you didn't win.",sadness
"You know, Yam Yam,
I'll go to you.",neutral
"Like, how did it feel
to perform the challenges,",neutral
"maybe differently
than you expected,",surprise
"but then how was it when
you finally did pull it out?",surprise
"So, the physical aspect of the
challenge was super scary to me.",fear
"Like, super scary, because
I'm not a physical person.",fear
I don't have good balance.,neutral
"I'm not fast.
I'm afraid of heights.",fear
"But I'm coming
from a very physical family.",neutral
"Like, my father is a cyclist.",Neutral
"My brother
has been athlete of the year",happiness
"and played in every single
sports team until now.",happiness
"Like, I am, like, just the kid
that watched TV, you know?",neutral
So I had to channel them.,neutral
"I had to channel their energy,
their words, their strength.",neutral
"And that's what happened
to the last gasp challenge.",neutral
"And I had no idea
I had it in me.",surprise
"I was doing everything
that I could do",neutral
"to distract from your voice,",neutral
"which is very supporting,
but it's very annoying",disgust
"(laughing) - when you're
in the middle of a challenge.",happiness
"And if I win,",neutral
"I'll be the first Puerto Rican
male to win tonight.",happiness
(laughing),happiness
HEIDI: I love that.,happiness
"PROBST: All right, let's move",neutral
"into the last section,
which does involve strategy,",neutral
"idols, and advantages
and how you use them.",neutral
Who wants to get us going?,neutral
"Yeah. So, Carolyn,
you had your name written down",neutral
"three times
throughout the game...",neutral
"The least
out of the three of you.",neutral
"You were on the right side
of the vote 88.89% of the time.",happiness
Very impressive.,surprise
"Walk me through
the strategy of that.",neutral
"Um, part of my strategy
was putting my trust in,",neutral
"one, Carson,",neutral
"you, who again,
we were so much alike.",sadness
"- Some of the bickering was kind of play...
- Was on purpose.",neutral
"We played it up, but a lot
of it, too, it wasn't.",neutral
"And it was
a risk to work with you,",fear
"but still, I was
underestimated so much that",sadness
"when it came to me finding
that idol, nobody expected that.",surprise
"Nobody. Plus,
I didn't say a word about it.",neutral
"But your idol
being played on Carson,",happiness
"you didn't
need to play on Carson.",surprise
"You needed to trust me
that Lauren and Jaime",sadness
"were gonna vote the way they
said, and I told you, like...",neutral
"CAROLYN: Okay, so
here's the difference is",neutral
"- do I trust you? Yes.
- Yes.",neutral
"Did I trust Lauren and Jaime?
No.",anger
"But I knew that
I needed Carson here",sadness
"to assure that Danny went home,",neutral
"'cause I wasn't gonna
get to the end with you here.",sadness
"- I needed the three.
- DANNY: Why?",neutral
"How did I logically
get in your way?",anger
"'Cause that's
a very specific thing to say.",surprise
"Because you were
seemingly running things,",neutral
were the one controlling votes.,neutral
"You were the one
coming up with plans.",neutral
"You were influencing
Jaime, Lauren, Heidi.",neutral
I needed you out.,anger
Cool. Well put.,neutral
"CARSON: Okay, great. Thank you.",neutral
"Yam Yam,
you voted 90% of the time",neutral
on the right side of the votes.,neutral
I've worked with you personally.,neutral
"I saw how you kind of
controlled your own destiny.",neutral
"Can you explain how you
continued to have control",neutral
"throughout this game,
strategically?",neutral
"This game
is about getting to the end.",neutral
"If you don't get to the end,
you don't get to win.",neutral
"And I knew
there were people in the way",neutral
"of me getting to the end.
So I wanted people",neutral
"that had the comfort
of writing my name down",neutral
"not be here
playing the game with me,",sadness
"'cause they were gonna
get that little feeling,",neutral
"the good feeling
of writing my name again.",happiness
"And it was
with the help of everybody,",neutral
"but it happened
because I wanted it to happen.",neutral
"So my game is about knowing
who wants to work with me,",neutral
who thinks I'm not a threat.,anger
"I won a necklace,
and I wasn't a threat,",happiness
"because I made myself
not a threat.",neutral
I really love talking.,happiness
I cannot go into a challenge,fear
"and push the biggest block
or jump the highest",neutral
or do the best balancing.,neutral
"What I can do
is I can talk, talk, talk, talk,",neutral
"in a way that
people were comfortable",neutral
"to feel like,
""He's here just to have fun.""",neutral
"I'm here to have fun,
but I want to win.",happiness
"And I hope
I make my family proud",happiness
"and my brother proud,
because he told me,",happiness
"""They pick you
because of who you are.",happiness
"""Just be yourself. You're gonna
do okay."" That's all I need.",happiness
"And that's all that
I keep repeating to myself.",sadness
"I just need to be who I am,
and I'm proud of it.",happiness
CARSON: Great. Thank you.,neutral
"So, Heidi, you were
on the right side of the vote",neutral
66.67% of the time.,neutral
How did you navigate through,neutral
"- your game, strategically?
- HEIDI: Yeah.",neutral
"My strategy coming into this
was not to have this.",surprise
"Okay?
However, the way it happened,",surprise
"I had to keep adapting
to survive here.",sadness
"And the difference
between some of the people here",neutral
"and myself was like,
""Oh, my God, I'm by myself.",sadness
"How am I gonna able control it?""",fear
"And maybe that's
part of the reason why,",neutral
"like, I kept my idol
a little bit longer.",happiness
"So I hope you respect
the fact that",neutral
"I had to adapt, and it hurt.",sadness
"It hurt. And you hit
the high highs, it's awesome,",surprise
"but not until
you hit that low low",sadness
"is when you truly find yourself
and you realize",happiness
this game goes way beyond money.,neutral
"This game is all about
finding myself",neutral
"and realizing the growth,
because I've been in the U.S.",neutral
"almost 20 years,
but when I moved, I struggle.",sadness
I couldn't speak English.,sadness
"I didn't have anything.
And that made me grow.",neutral
"Like, I see the growth in me,
and now seeing that I'm here,",happiness
"living my dream, I truly
am living the American dream.",happiness
"So for those people
that sound different,",neutral
"look different, want to be
in science and they're girls,",neutral
"follow your dreams, no matter
what age or who you are.",happiness
"You're female, male,",neutral
"whatever age you are, follow
your dreams no matter what.",happiness
And that's the reason I'm here.,neutral
PROBST: I love this.,happiness
"Right before
we get ready to vote...",neutral

It's-it's crazy to be here.,surprise

"The only thing left to do now
is for the jury vote",neutral

is most deserving",neutral

give you a moment",neutral

you've heard,",neutral
