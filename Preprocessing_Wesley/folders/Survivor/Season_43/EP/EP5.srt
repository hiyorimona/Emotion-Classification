1
00:00:15,344 --> 00:00:17,241
<i>So tonight, Lindsay went home.</i>

2
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:21,206
<i>It was originally me,
Karla, James and Lindsay.</i>

3
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,344
We were all four gonna
vote together to get Geo out.

4
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:27,379
Okay, yeah.

5
00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:29,758
But then Lindsay started,
you know, kind of spiraling out

6
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:30,896
and getting really paranoid.

7
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,310
<i>We told Ryan and Geo
at the last minute,</i>

8
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:44,034
<i>and so we all voted for Lindsay.</i>

9
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:46,034
I also got a vote,
which stung a little.

10
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:49,103
<i>So at this point, I just
wanted to kind of clear the air</i>

11
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:50,310
and figure out who voted for me.

12
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:51,931
I knew it was
either Geo or Ryan.

13
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:54,931
Does anybody want to talk?
Anybody have any questions?

14
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:57,689
Um, I guess, I just,
if whoever wrote my name down

15
00:00:57,793 --> 00:00:59,206
wants to, like,
talk about that...

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,482
We can... I can walk
and talk with you, real quick.

17
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,724
- Okay.
- Just drum the beats,
to explain that part.

18
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:05,379
- Was that you?
- Um, no, it's wasn't me,

19
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,862
but I don't want the person
who wrote it down to be held...

20
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,689
So... I mean...

21
00:01:12,793 --> 00:01:14,862
<i>In this game, like, it's all
about choosing your battles.</i>

22
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:16,310
<i>And so, at that moment,</i>

23
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:18,000
<i>it was like,
"I just need to play nice."</i>

24
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:19,482
<i>But in the back of my mind,
I'm like, you know,</i>

25
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:21,896
"I want to go after the people
who put my name down."

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,310
So, Ryan actually
came up with the idea that

27
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:29,379
if you are
giving her information,

28
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:31,206
we should put one vote on you

29
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,931
and the rest of the votes
on Lindsay.

30
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:36,724
- That's just how it went down,
to be honest.
- Okay. Yeah.

31
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:38,551
<i>Geo is just, like,
clueless about the game.</i>

32
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,137
<i>It's like, are you kidding me?</i>

33
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:43,586
<i>Ryan and Geo think that
they have the numbers right now,</i>

34
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,827
<i>but the truth is
they're at the bottom.</i>

35
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,344
I think they're still
gonna try to gun for me

36
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:48,620
if we do have
to go to another Tribal.

37
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:50,034
<i>And you know what they say,</i>

38
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:52,344
<i>revenge is a dish
best served cold, so...</i>

39
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:55,827
I'm just biding my time till
I can pay them back for that.

40
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't vote for you.
That was Lindsay.

41
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:02,448
- So Lindsay voted for me?
- I voted for Lindsay. Yeah.

42
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,206
What do you think,
Lindsay voted for herself?

43
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,551
No.

44
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:08,034
<i>I put a vote on Cassidy,
just in case.</i>

45
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,551
I don't think she-she likes me.

46
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:11,482
I don't think
she's gonna trust me now.

47
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:13,000
<i>She's not gonna trust me later.</i>

48
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:14,517
<i>And that's fine,
'cause, you know,</i>

49
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,896
at the end of the day,
I still have the numbers.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,655
<i>There isn't much that Cassidy
can do unless we hit a merge.</i>

51
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:22,379
She's in the outs, completely.

52
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:30,413
I guess we'll just...

53
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:35,586
Yeah.

54
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,103
<i>Yeah, it's all about
getting comfortable.</i>

55
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,137
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

56
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,000
These ...

57
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,793
<i>At this point,
we're gonna try to decide</i>

58
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:49,379
<i>whether Ryan or Geo go first.</i>

59
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:51,965
I want their egos to be stroked
and their heads to be big,

60
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:54,206
because that's when
people make mistakes.

61
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,931
<i>And I'll be watching
and I'll be waiting.</i>

62
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:58,482
So let them.

63
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:17,172
Basically, every time
we get some time alone,

64
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:19,206
<i>we're looking
for the hidden immunity idol.</i>

65
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,931
<i>We're looking up in the trees.</i>

66
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,034
<i>We're looking for places
that we haven't been.</i>

67
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,482
<i>Just really trying anything,</i>

68
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:26,689
<i>because it's been
a lot of days looking.</i>

69
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:28,517
I feel like
I've looked everywhere.

70
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:32,724
<i>But as we're walking,
we see this tree,</i>

71
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:35,862
and it's, like, lit up
in all of its <i>Survivor</i> glory,

72
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,586
just... <i>♪ singing.♪</i>

73
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:41,931
All right, I'll go check.

74
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:45,931
<i>As a</i> Survivor <i>fan, I know
to look in nooks and crannies.</i>

75
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:48,551
I know to look
in any suspicious holes.

76
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:53,103
<i>And so I poke in one hole,
and it's not there.</i>

77
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:59,517
<i>And then I look down
into the tree, and...</i>

78
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, my God.

79
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:06,551
Oh, my God.

80
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:09,172
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

81
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:19,310
It's covered in ants.

82
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:21,586
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

83
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,724
Elie.

84
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:25,379
Come here.

85
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,344
<i>I'm shell-shocked that I
have found the Beware Advantage.</i>

86
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:30,413
I am so excited.

87
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,862
I'm also terrified, because
I know it's a Beware Advantage,

88
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,931
so I know that
it's gonna come at a cost.

89
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:36,758
Oh, my God.

90
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:39,413
But...

91
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,655
Let's read it over here.

92
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:43,137
<i>In that moment, I'm thinking,</i>

93
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,689
"Do I trust my alliance?

94
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:45,896
Do I need my vote?"

95
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:51,931
So should I do it? Are you sure?

96
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:53,448
- Yeah. I am sure.
- Are you sure? Okay.

97
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:56,344
<i>Right now,
the tribe dynamic for me</i>

98
00:04:56,448 --> 00:05:00,689
<i>is that I feel secure in
my alliance with Elie and Sami.</i>

99
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:03,482
<i>Owen thinks
that he's in on an alliance</i>

100
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,310
<i>with Elie and I, but in my mind,</i>

101
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:07,482
<i>he is a really nervous player.</i>

102
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:09,517
So there's a little bit
of a question mark there.

103
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,620
<i>And then Gabler's
getting on everyone's nerves,</i>

104
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,310
so he seems like the next to go.

105
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:18,034
<i>The complication is, though,
that he still has a valid idol,</i>

106
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:21,551
and we think
he doesn't know that it's valid.

107
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:50,172
- Do you think everyone
would give me their bead?
- Yeah.

108
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,482
You don't think anyone
would be suspicious?

109
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,241
Yeah.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hey.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hey.

112
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:11,206
Perfect timing.

113
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,586
And as I'm saying, "We
shouldn't tell Owen right now,"

114
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,275
I look up, and there is Owen.

115
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,344
Nothing? Mm-hmm.

116
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,724
Okay, you want to talk about it?

117
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:28,137
<i>We know that we're caught.</i>

118
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:30,034
We've got no choice
but to share it with Owen.

119
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:33,310
Basically,
I have to collect a bead

120
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:36,068
- from each of you guys
to start the bracelet.
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:38,655
<i>Reading over the note,
my first thought was like,</i>

122
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:40,793
<i>"I could mess some things up."</i>

123
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:42,931
If I denied Jeanine my bead,

124
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:45,379
I could go with Sami and Gabler
and just get her out

125
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:47,551
<i>the next time we lose.</i>

126
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:49,034
<i>And they wouldn't be
able to do anything about it,</i>

127
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:50,965
<i>because Jeanine has no vote.</i>

128
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:54,517
<i>But I have been thinking about
working with Elie and Jeanine,</i>

129
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,344
<i>because that gives me
more options moving forward.</i>

130
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:59,275
<i>Playing with someone
like Gabler,</i>

131
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:00,827
<i>it is a little concerning.</i>

132
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:02,965
<i>You never know what
you're gonna get with him,</i>

133
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:04,655
so I'm gonna
give Jeanine my bead.

134
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,896
Why don't you just take 'em all?

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,103
- Oh, my God.
- Take 'em all.

136
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,620
- Can I hug you?
- Yeah, absolutely.

137
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:11,482
<i>And I want to make sure
she knows that this is a symbol</i>

138
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:13,689
of my trust
that I am handing to you.

139
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,655
...but we found
a Beware Advantage.

140
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:21,413
- Where at?
- In a tree.

141
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:23,137
<i>Elie ends up telling me</i>

142
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:25,379
that Jeanine
found the Beware Advantage.

143
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:30,137
<i>And I have to try to act happy
and pleasant about this,</i>

144
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,482
but in my head,
I know I've been trying to plot

145
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,034
against Jeanine and Elie.

146
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,517
So Owen already knows,
'cause he walked up on us,

147
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,275
and I tried to hide the paper.

148
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,413
<i>So at this point,
all of us know exactly</i>

149
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:43,137
<i>what Jeanine is doing,
except for Gabler--</i>

150
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:44,689
<i>who, right now,</i>

151
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:47,000
seems to have no idea
what's going on in this game.

152
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:50,724
<i>Pregame warm-up.
Everybody's chilling out.</i>

153
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:52,724
If we're kind of taking a chill,

154
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:55,103
- I really want
to make a bracelet.
- Go for it.

155
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,620
But I want to do, like,
I want to, I want to know

156
00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:59,379
a little, have a little bit
from each of you.

157
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:01,655
- Aw.
- So I was hoping
that I could, like,

158
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:04,068
grab a couple beads from your
bags or something to make it.

159
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,068
Ah, that would be nice.

160
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:08,344
I've got beads
and cool stuff, too.

161
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:10,275
Yeah? Oh, my God. Thank you.

162
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:11,689
Here's mine.
Do you like that one?

163
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:14,413
Yeah. Perfect. Thank you.

164
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:16,241
- That one?
- Yeah.

165
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:18,931
<i>So at this point,
I'm feeling good.</i>

166
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:22,000
I have four
of the five beads that I need--

167
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:24,241
Gabler's bead being
the last that I need to get.

168
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,482
Oh, my God.

169
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:31,413
You get two.

170
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:32,827
Ooh.

171
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:34,724
<i>Gabler has
this entire pouch of beads</i>

172
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:36,517
that he's been making bracelets
from for his daughters.

173
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,137
<i>And he hands me two
that I'm like,</i>

174
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,344
"Ah, those are useless."

175
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:41,793
They're just
two little green ones.

176
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,275
<i>And I see, in his pouch,
the one that I need.</i>

177
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,482
Can I take this chunky one?

178
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:49,551
Um, I was gonna hold
that bead for my daughter.

179
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,379
Oh.

180
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:52,965
<i>When Gabler says,</i>

181
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:55,034
<i>"I was saving that one
for my daughter."</i>

182
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm like, "Boom.
Over. We are screwed.

183
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:00,310
"Jeanine just lost her vote
until the merge,

184
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,896
<i>"because there's
nothing in this world</i>

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,413
<i>that Gabler cares more about
than his daughters."</i>

186
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:07,758
<i>If it were me,
I would have been stunned,</i>

187
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:09,517
<i>but Jeanine handled it so well.</i>

188
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,517
- Can I give you the green back?
- Yeah.

189
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,482
- This one just reminds me
of you. Thank you so much.
- Okay, well, then good.

190
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,482
- I'm the big yellow. Good. Done.
- Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

191
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:18,586
<i>And Gabler melts like butter,
right in her hand,</i>

192
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:21,896
squishy, soft butter,
and trades Jeanine.

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,172
And... we got it.

194
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:27,137
Thanks for entertaining
the artist in me.

195
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:28,724
<i>Lo and behold, Jeanine</i>

196
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,551
has a hidden immunity idol.

197
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:33,275
<i>And so,
I want to let Gabler know.</i>

198
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:36,241
<i>I'm hoping that this
can make him trust me more,</i>

199
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:38,689
and realize I'm trying
to play this game with him.

200
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:42,241
Listen, those beads
that we just gave Jeanine--

201
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:44,517
- Uh-huh.
- that gave her an idol.

202
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

203
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,103
No, we gave her a real idol.

204
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,413
She found the Advantage.

205
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,655
I didn't have time
to tell you, but...

206
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,275
...

207
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:04,000
You swear?

208
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,000
<i>Dude, I can't make this up
if I wanted to.</i>

209
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,344
Now the game
has changed dramatically,

210
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,896
not in our favor.

211
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:14,551
Oh, my God.

212
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,448
<i>Jeanine is now protected,</i>

213
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:24,758
<i>and Jeanine could
give her idol to Elie.</i>

214
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:26,793
<i>There's many ways
this could explode on us.</i>

215
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:29,034
<i>It went from being
a much simpler game</i>

216
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:31,034
<i>to a very complicated game</i>

217
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:34,172
by me handing a bead
to my friend.

218
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,275
And that's-that's... that's...

219
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,448
She got me. She got me.
I'll say that. She got me.

220
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:02,137
Come on in.

221
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:18,103
Baka, Vesi, getting your first
look at the new Coco tribe.

222
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:21,724
Lindsay voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

223
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:27,344
All right. Shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

224
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:29,000
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

225
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:31,206
All right, first things first,
I got to take back the idols.

226
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,896
Thank you, Cody.

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,724
Thank you, Elie.

228
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:41,931
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

229
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,896
For today's challenge,

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,379
<i>four tribe members
will be tied together.</i>

231
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:48,413
<i>On my go, you'll work together</i>

232
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,068
<i>to get through
a series of obstacles.</i>

233
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:51,758
<i>You'll then grab a bucket,
fill it with water,</i>

234
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:54,862
<i>make your way
over a giant teeter-totter...</i>

235
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:58,758
<i>...transferring whatever water's
left into another bucket.</i>

236
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:01,586
<i>You'll do this until you have
enough water to lower the gate.</i>

237
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:04,448
<i>When you reach the finish,</i>

238
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:07,000
<i>you will race
to roll balls up a ramp,</i>

239
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,137
<i>landing them
on a small platform.</i>

240
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:12,758
First two tribes to finish

241
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,793
win immunity,
safe from the vote.

242
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,689
In addition,
you are playing for a reward.

243
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:19,310
- Want to know
what you're playing for?
- Yeah!

244
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:22,310
Maybe the most
valuable thing out here. Tarps.

245
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,655
Yes, very good.
That's it, okay, that's it.

246
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:27,793
First tribe to finish,
large tarp.

247
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:30,310
This will keep you dry
and keep you in the shade,

248
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:32,965
which is another way
to think of a tarp.

249
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:36,448
Second tribe to finish, smaller
tarp, will get the job done.

250
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:39,275
The third tribe to finish,
otherwise known as the losers,

251
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,000
date with me tonight
at Tribal Council,

252
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:44,172
where somebody will be the fifth
person voted out of this game.

253
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,896
And as a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,413
Coco, you are still playing
to get yours back.

255
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,724
- All right, sit-outs.
Coco, you have one extra person.
- I'll sit out.

256
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:53,137
- Who you gonna sit out?
It's gonna be Karla.
- Me.

257
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:55,862
That was fast.
Baka, who's it gonna be?

258
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:57,241
Gabler gonna sit this one out.
All right, sit-outs,

259
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,655
take a spot on the bench.

260
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:00,275
Everybody else,
give you minute to strategize.

261
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,931
We'll get it on.

262
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:14,344
Here we go.
For immunity and reward.

263
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:15,827
Survivors ready.

264
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:18,724
Go!

265
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,655
Stage one,
you have to work together

266
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:25,586
to find a path through the chaos

267
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,344
of all
of these sticks tied together.

268
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:31,068
All three of these
are exactly the same.

269
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:32,275
When the <i>Survivor</i> art department

270
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,551
makes something,
it is identical.

271
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:36,172
- You just got to figure out
how to get through it.
- Good job, Baka!

272
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,172
Okay.

273
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,724
- Vesi and Baka,
side by side.
- Good, good, good.

274
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,689
Cody's through. Elie's through.

275
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:46,068
Here comes Owen.
There's Ryan for Coco.

276
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,448
You got to get everybody
through this.

277
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:49,655
- It is Vesi in the lead.
- Over.

278
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:52,482
- Good job. Let's go. Let's go.
- There's Coco.
Over and under. Over and under.

279
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:54,793
- Baka's through.
- Go, go.

280
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:58,758
It is Vesi and Coco, then Baka.

281
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:01,620
- Yeah, we're tied together.
- Now Coco through first.

282
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:04,379
You're good.
Now it's Coco in the lead,

283
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:05,896
then Vesi, then Baka.

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,965
You're gonna get water

285
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:08,482
and head
over that teeter-totter.

286
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:11,827
- Coco has theirs.
- Take your time, y'all.

287
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,586
- Ryan has the water,
heading up and over.
- Ready?

288
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,793
There goes Vesi.
They've got theirs.

289
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,896
Good job, Ryan. Good job.

290
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,448
- Coco, nice job!
Ryan holds on to lot of water.
- Beautiful. Good job.

291
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:23,448
Here goes Vesi.

292
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:25,103
- Baka's right behind.
- Good job, Ryan.

293
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:27,000
- Do it again.
- The whole pot.

294
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:29,103
You dump your water,
then you got to come back.

295
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,655
- Back, back, back.
- Come on.

296
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:31,689
Come on, come on. Go back.

297
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:32,758
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

298
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:38,000
Nice job by Vesi!
Great teamwork.

299
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:39,551
- Stay low.
- All right, move your weight.

300
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:41,655
Vesi up, dumping their water.

301
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:43,448
Baka heading
over with their water.

302
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,137
Slow down. Slow down.

303
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:47,724
- Here comes Coco again.
Will this be enough?
- Go, Coco!

304
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:49,724
Baka's taking
a really long time.

305
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:51,275
Here we go.

306
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,827
Coco drops their gate.
You're good, Coco.

307
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,275
Head over the gate.

308
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,379
Here goes Baka with
their first bucket of the water.

309
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:00,931
It is Coco now.

310
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,068
It's gonna be
Ryan rolling balls.

311
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:04,103
Here we go.

312
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:06,206
- Oh, so close.
- Hold it.

313
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,241
Vesi with another bucket.
Cody another. Nice job.

314
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:11,689
Four tribe members
really working together well.

315
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,724
That's gonna do it.

316
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,275
Vesi drops their gate.
You're good.

317
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:19,379
Here comes Baka.

318
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,310
- Nice. Good.
- Good job, guys.

319
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:26,551
- It is Ryan, off and on.
- Come on, Ryan.

320
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:29,379
- Come on, Dwight.
- It's gonna
be Dwight for Vesi.

321
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,379
Baka drops their gate.
Here they come.

322
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,241
It is Ryan and Dwight.

323
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:37,413
- Now you're
rolling balls up a ramp.
- Hey, you got this, Sami.

324
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:39,379
- Go, Sami.
- Sami in now for Baka.

325
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,310
You're still in this, Baka.

326
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:43,551
All three tribes
yet to get on the board.

327
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:47,379
That ball
needs to come to a rest

328
00:15:47,482 --> 00:15:49,689
at the top of the platform.

329
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:52,068
- Too much speed,
it goes off the back.
- You got it, Dwight.

330
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:55,620
- You got it, buddy.
- Not enough,
it won't get there.

331
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:58,758
- This is all about
finding that feel.
- Yes. Okay.

332
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:02,551
Ryan with a nice toss.
He's got one for Coco.

333
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:05,896
- One. That might do it.
That's one for Vesi.
- Come on, Dwight.

334
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,103
Come on, Dwight.

335
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:09,172
Everybody's starting
to get a feel.

336
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,965
- There it is.
There it is.
- Nice. Yes.

337
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:13,103
- Yes, Sami. Yes...
- There it is. Sami lands
the first one for Baka.

338
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,724
We are tied. One each.

339
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:18,172
- All three tribes.
Three balls total.
- Get up.

340
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:20,068
- Stay up there.
- Dwight with a second.
Will it stay?

341
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:23,724
No. The slow roll.

342
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:25,896
There goes
Ryan with a nice toss.

343
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,862
Will it stick? It does.
It is Coco in the lead with two.

344
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:30,482
- There it is. There's the kid.
- Yes, yes, yes.

345
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:32,379
Sami drops the second,
but it won't stick.

346
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:39,413
- Dwight lands
a second for Vesi.
- Nice, Dwight.

347
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:40,724
- All you, Dwight.
- We are tied two-two.

348
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:42,689
It is Vesi with two,
Coco with two.

349
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,275
Ryan could win it
right here for Coco.

350
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:47,482
No. On and off.

351
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:49,068
Dwight could win it right here.

352
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,965
Dwight. Will it stick?

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,103
It does! Vesi wins immunity!

354
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:57,241
We're looking for one more.

355
00:16:57,344 --> 00:16:59,103
It is Sami and Ryan.

356
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:01,000
Immunity still on the line.

357
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,793
- Sami with number two.
- Yes, Sami. Yes.

358
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:07,241
Will it stay? Yes, it does.

359
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:08,965
- Baka with two.
- Yes, Sami!

360
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:10,310
One ball left for immunity.

361
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:12,655
Ryan now feeling the pressure.

362
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,275
Aim for the right side.

363
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,206
Ryan close,
but knocks all three balls off.

364
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,275
- Yes.
- Ah, Ryan.

365
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:23,586
Ryan knocks everything off
for Coco.

366
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:25,413
- I'm sorry, guys.
- It is now

367
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:27,655
Baka in the lead with two.

368
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:29,896
Will that do it? Will it stay?

369
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:33,206
And it does!

370
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,137
Baka wins immunity!

371
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:38,827
- Yo, bro, it's good.
- Sending Coco
back to Tribal Council,

372
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:43,241
where somebody will be the fifth
person voted out of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

373
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:45,758
- What a finish.
- Hey, but I don't
go to Chuck E. Cheese that much.

374
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:52,275
Vesi, another victory.

375
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:53,620
Well-earned.

376
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,517
Nobody from your tribe
going home.

377
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,827
- Yeah, baby.
- Come grab your tarp.

378
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:01,689
- It'll keep you safe
from the rain and the sun.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:05,551
Baka, nobody going
home from your tribe.

380
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:07,137
- Thank you.
- Come grab your tarp.

381
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:08,724
I'll get it.

382
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:09,965
Well-earned.

383
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,206
All right,
before I send you on your way,

384
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,724
Vesi, choose one person
from Coco

385
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,137
to go on a journey.

386
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:22,137
They will return back to
camp in time for Tribal Council.

387
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:24,310
- Who's it gonna be?
- We're gonna go with Geo.

388
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:26,379
Geo, you're gonna
go on a journey.

389
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:29,000
Choose somebody
from Baka to join Geo.

390
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,379
Uh, we're gonna go with Jeanine.

391
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:34,620
- Jeanine and Geo
gonna be on the journey.
- All right.

392
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:37,896
One person from the four of you.
Who's gonna go?

393
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,517
- Me.
- It's gonna be Jesse.
- Jesse.

394
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,103
All right, grab your stuff,
head out. Boat will take you.

395
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:44,413
You will return back to camp
in time for Tribal Council.

396
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:49,379
Vesi, Baka, nice job. Nobody
going home. Enjoy the night off.

397
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:51,448
- Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.
- Thank you.

398
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:52,655
Thanks, Jeff.

399
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,482
All right, Coco, you were
playing to earn your flint back.

400
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:59,137
I'll still keep it for now.
Sorry for you.

401
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,758
Tribal Council tonight,
Coco, where somebody will be

402
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:04,172
the fifth person
voted out of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

403
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,000
Grab your stuff, head out.
I'll see you tonight at Tribal.

404
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,482
Thank you, Jeff.

405
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:10,034
<i>I think it's time
I let something out of the bag.</i>

406
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:12,172
<i>About the end of that challenge,
I was thinking,</i>

407
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:13,241
"Should I win this?

408
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:14,793
"Should I really try 100%,

409
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,000
or should I knock
these two balls off?"

410
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:19,241
<i>Kind of made that decision
to throw that</i>

411
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:20,758
<i>at the end of that challenge,</i>

412
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:22,275
<i>because I've been
trying to vote out Cassidy</i>

413
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:23,379
<i>for a very long time.</i>

414
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:25,137
<i>And I know that when</i>

415
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:28,379
Jeff says, "Fifth person
going home, Survivor 43,"

416
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:29,862
it's gonna be Cassidy.

417
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:49,068
I'm sorry. I was... I was
so close at the end of that.

418
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:50,517
- I know. That's okay.
- I mean...

419
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,310
- We did... we were...
- Team effort.

420
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:54,137
<i>I throw this challenge
without anybody knowing,</i>

421
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,241
<i>'cause it looked
like I was really trying.</i>

422
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:58,137
I looked upset,
but I was pretty happy.

423
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:01,206
<i>I know they wanted to win,</i>

424
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,241
<i>and I know winning feels great,
numbers are great,</i>

425
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:06,000
<i>but now we can go to Tribal
and vote Cassidy out.</i>

426
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,862
<i>I'm good at acting, so
we tell Cassidy the vote's me,</i>

427
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,310
because I did mess up.

428
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,758
<i>As long as we keep Cassidy
in the mindset</i>

429
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:20,344
<i>that I'm going home tonight,</i>

430
00:20:20,448 --> 00:20:22,448
<i>I feel like she won't
play her Shot in the Dark.</i>

431
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:25,034
<i>She's caught in our web.
She's not able to escape.</i>

432
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:26,827
We got four spiders
all ready to eat her.

433
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:34,172
- ...to vote Ryan.
- Why would Ryan tell you
to say his own name?

434
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,793
Because he's comfortable.

435
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:37,103
'Cause they want
to blindside you.

436
00:20:37,206 --> 00:20:38,482
It's a easy four-zero vote.

437
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,000
Take a deep breath.

438
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:42,896
We have three votes.
We're putting them on Geo.

439
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,862
And the reason why we put 'em on
Geo is he's the most comfortable

440
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:47,379
- he's ever going to be.
- What if he gets an advantage?

441
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:49,689
Like an idol that's only good
for one Tribal?

442
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:52,896
Yeah, with those "what ifs,"
if you feel comfortable

443
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,241
putting three on Ryan...

444
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:56,827
Pret... 100% sure I trust Karla.

445
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:58,172
Okay.

446
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:00,137
<i>We were deciding
between Geo and Ryan.</i>

447
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:02,896
<i>I brought up voting out Ryan.
I think it would be a good move.</i>

448
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,103
<i>And I think it would</i>

449
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:05,724
be less risk on my part.

450
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah.

451
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:14,655
<i>If we target Ryan, most likely
I'll be safe tonight,</i>

452
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:16,482
<i>and Ryan will go home,</i>

453
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:17,931
because I don't think
Geo would use

454
00:21:18,034 --> 00:21:19,586
any advantage
that he had on Ryan,

455
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,413
'cause I don't think Geo worries
that Ryan's gonna be voted out.

456
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:22,827
Hi.

457
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:24,896
Oh, my God.

458
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,482
You're cutting down
that whole tree?

459
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,827
Yeah.

460
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:29,310
I'm frustrated.

461
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,620
I usually go to the gym
to get my frustration out.

462
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,103
Yeah.
What are you frustrated about?

463
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:35,931
It's just, like,
they're being nice,

464
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:38,310
but I guess they were really
frustrated with the challenge,

465
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:39,413
'cause we were...

466
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:44,896
Because the change.

467
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,103
James came back with a different
energy, after he talked to me.

468
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,655
Yeah.

469
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,724
I'd rather you vote me
and not be on the wrong side

470
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:57,000
of the vote, in case it is me,

471
00:21:57,103 --> 00:21:58,586
so that you have
a chance to get further.

472
00:21:58,689 --> 00:21:59,965
You know what I mean?

473
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,448
<i>Ryan thinks he's come up with</i>

474
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:03,655
<i>this mastermind plan
to put the votes on him.</i>

475
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:05,655
<i>And he's trying to act so noble,</i>

476
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,413
<i>like, "The votes
are going towards me."</i>

477
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:08,896
Like, "I don't want you to be
on the wrong side of the numbers

478
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,551
"going forward.
I want you to be good.

479
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:12,344
So, like, if you have
to vote me, you can."

480
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:13,758
And meanwhile,
this whole time I'm like,

481
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:16,068
"You're so full of B.S."

482
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:20,551
Okay. Oh, my God. Okay.

483
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:21,793
Why? What was he saying?

484
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:22,931
He's like...

485
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:26,413
He's like, "I just felt
the energy totally change

486
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:28,000
"with them, while you
were at the water well.

487
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:29,655
I don't know.
I just have a feeling it's me."

488
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:31,206
He's like,
"If it's me, you know,

489
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,862
I don't want you to be on
the wrong side of the numbers."

490
00:22:37,827 --> 00:22:39,275
It's funny because

491
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,206
<i>Ryan's planning
this whole thing and, like,</i>

492
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,448
<i>using himself
as a decoy, and now</i>

493
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:44,586
he's the actual vote.

494
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:46,931
My man. Good job.

495
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:54,862
If this plays out,

496
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:57,655
I'm gonna have some ink
on my <i>Survivor</i> résumé.

497
00:22:57,758 --> 00:22:59,275
And that's what I want.

498
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,206
Right now, you're definitely
playing a believable story,

499
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,689
so just keep up whatever
level of acting you're doing.

500
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:05,206
I got you.

501
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,586
<i>Hopefully this
follows me outside the game.</i>

502
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:09,965
- They're like,
"You're pretty good."
- Stop.

503
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:13,379
Nice.

504
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:23,448
<i>On the journey,</i>

505
00:23:23,551 --> 00:23:25,586
<i>me, Geo and Jeanine,
we're pulling up</i>

506
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:28,620
to this beautiful little island
in the middle of the ocean.

507
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:32,586
<i>And so I'm thinking,
"Oh, it's gonna be simple.</i>

508
00:23:32,689 --> 00:23:34,586
<i>"We're gonna get
to walk up to this table.</i>

509
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:36,000
<i>"We're gonna
get to take our risk</i>

510
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:37,827
<i>and potentially get a reward."</i>

511
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:42,172
<i>And then we pass the island,</i>

512
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:44,413
<i>and we come up on this,
like, pontoon</i>

513
00:23:44,517 --> 00:23:48,310
<i>that has this, like,
rinky-dink boat attached to it.</i>

514
00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:50,241
- Hands.
- Okay. Thank you.

515
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, of course.

516
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:54,034
We made it.

517
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:56,758
Nice to meet you.

518
00:23:56,862 --> 00:23:57,896
Okay.

519
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:08,034
I feel like I invited
you guys to a really ... party.

520
00:24:08,137 --> 00:24:09,827
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm so sorry.

521
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:12,068
No, this is great.
This is a boat party.

522
00:24:12,172 --> 00:24:13,068
- Let's do it.
- All right. Let's do it.

523
00:24:13,172 --> 00:24:14,827
<i>We read that we have to sort of</i>

524
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:18,000
<i>row our way to that
beautiful little island.</i>

525
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:22,896
So I was, like,
not too excited about this.

526
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,379
- We're making progress.
- Sorry.

527
00:24:38,482 --> 00:24:40,034
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Somewhat, yeah.

528
00:24:41,206 --> 00:24:42,965
It's kind of weird for me,

529
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:45,068
because I thought I was gonna
get voted out last night.

530
00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:47,379
I'm so sorry about that.

531
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:50,206
<i>I'm not being 100% honest
with Jesse and Jeanine.</i>

532
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,172
I know I'm safe, and
I'm protected by my alliance...

533
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,689
- We're so close. <i>
- ...but I kind
of lie a little bit</i>

534
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:57,344
<i>about being in the bottom,</i>

535
00:24:57,448 --> 00:24:59,137
so that way
they can try to help me.

536
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:00,689
How are you feeling
tonight, though?

537
00:25:00,793 --> 00:25:02,137
Um, I'm scared still.

538
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:03,620
Like, I am
the smallest guy in the group.

539
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:06,517
<i>Maybe they can feel bad for me
and be like,</i>

540
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,793
"Hey, you know what?

541
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,586
"You kind of need this
more than I do,

542
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:11,379
<i>and let me not risk my vote."</i>

543
00:25:11,482 --> 00:25:14,172
<i>So that way I can get whatever
advantage there was on there.</i>

544
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:15,482
Damn. Okay.

545
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:17,655
So I'm kind
of just milking the moment.

546
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,034
You want to get out?

547
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:20,862
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Oh...

548
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:22,620
Just to see if somebody bites.

549
00:25:22,724 --> 00:25:25,586
- I don't want to go
home with any regrets.
- Yeah.

550
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:28,551
- I'm gonna risk everything
I can to be able to stay.
- Yeah.

551
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:29,931
You're definitely risking?

552
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:31,206
But I'm definitely risking.

553
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,620
<i>From the get-go,</i>

554
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:34,724
<i>Geo's kind of like,
"I'm on the outs.</i>

555
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,620
I need this. I'm risking it."

556
00:25:36,724 --> 00:25:41,137
<i>And I'm not sure
if I buy this underdog story.</i>

557
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:44,965
<i>I wish that I could trust him,
and so now I'm racking my brain.</i>

558
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,827
<i>Geo, I mean, I think
he's taking a risk</i>

559
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:49,862
<i>because his back
is against the wall.</i>

560
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,172
But Jeanine seems like she's,
you know, out here to play.

561
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,517
<i>Like, she's got
scars on her chin already.</i>

562
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,517
<i>She's got scars on her knees.</i>

563
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,000
<i>For me, I really have
to think through</i>

564
00:25:59,103 --> 00:26:00,517
<i>whether I'm gonna
risk it or not.</i>

565
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:29,379
<i>We had to make a decision
whether we were gonna</i>

566
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:31,068
<i>risk our vote
or not risk our vote.</i>

567
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,793
<i>If we risked our vote,
we had a chance at an advantage,</i>

568
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:36,379
<i>but if I risk my vote
and I lose it,</i>

569
00:26:36,482 --> 00:26:38,172
it's really dangerous
to be on a four-person tribe

570
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:39,517
and you don't have a say.

571
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, I really need this,
so I have no choice.

572
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:58,206
Yeah.

573
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:02,275
So we all take a risk,
and now I have a 33% chance

574
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:03,482
<i>to get the advantage.</i>

575
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:05,137
<i>Which is limited odds,</i>

576
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:07,758
<i>but I'm here on</i> Survivor, <i>
and I had to do it.</i>

577
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:11,379
I came out here, you know,
to set an example for my kids--

578
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:13,068
<i>to dream big and go for it.</i>

579
00:27:13,172 --> 00:27:14,758
<i>And so, like,
I don't think there was</i>

580
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:17,137
<i>really a question of whether
I was gonna risk it or not.</i>

581
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:18,620
This is a million-dollar game.

582
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:21,551
<i>Dang.
All that lying I just</i>

583
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:23,068
had to do for no reason.

584
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:24,655
<i>But I think it's worth the risk,</i>

585
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:27,724
<i>because even
if I don't get anything,</i>

586
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:29,172
<i>we still have three votes.</i>

587
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:31,068
So at least
I'll be able to be protected.

588
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:32,793
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

589
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:34,310
Let's go.

590
00:27:34,413 --> 00:27:37,068
But if I do get an advantage,
that'll be crazy, huh?

591
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,034
<i>Coming back to camp,</i>

592
00:27:57,137 --> 00:27:58,413
<i>you know, there's
no use in being dishonest.</i>

593
00:27:58,517 --> 00:27:59,586
<i>There's no use in, like,</i>

594
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:01,137
trying to pull one over on them.

595
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:02,965
They know
what I went out there to do.

596
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,689
Jesse!

597
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:05,931
Let me sit down.

598
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:07,448
Yeah, come sit down by the fire.

599
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:08,793
- We got it going.
- Yeah...

600
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,793
<i>So I plan to just be honest</i>

601
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:11,827
and see what happens.

602
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:15,310
I risked and they risked.

603
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:17,586
And so, one-in-third shot.

604
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:19,931
- Yeah.
- All righty.

605
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,965
<i>I have this little shell
that was tied together,</i>

606
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:27,310
<i>and so I decided to open it
with the rest of the tribe,</i>

607
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:29,206
<i>because I'd rather them know</i>

608
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,379
where the votes stand.

609
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:36,241
Aw.
It's all right.

610
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:38,068
- No big deal.
- No worries.

611
00:28:38,172 --> 00:28:41,172
<i>So I took a big swing,
and I got a big miss.</i>

612
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:44,413
I lost my vote
at the next Tribal Council.

613
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:50,689
So I come back to camp
with a little shell,

614
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:52,965
<i>which I know inside has my fate.</i>

615
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:55,517
<i>And it's crucial that
I know what's in there</i>

616
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,034
before I tell my tribemates.

617
00:29:02,413 --> 00:29:05,586
So I peel aside at camp
to sneak a peek.

618
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:15,931
Okay.

619
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:17,034
Crap.

620
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:19,413
Crap, crap.

621
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:21,413
Hello!

622
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,517
- We literally just said,
you should be home soon. <i>
- Obviously not what</i>

623
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,689
I wanted to happen,

624
00:29:26,793 --> 00:29:28,793
<i>but, so far,</i>

625
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:31,413
<i>our tribe has been
very open and communicative</i>

626
00:29:31,517 --> 00:29:33,620
<i>with these advantages, and</i>

627
00:29:33,724 --> 00:29:35,793
I want my tribe to feel like

628
00:29:35,896 --> 00:29:38,517
they are
on the same page with me.

629
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,827
You guys...

630
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:42,068
...I risked it...

631
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:44,172
And?

632
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:45,724
Let's open it.

633
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:49,551
So I'm kind of playing a little
bit of a actor role here,

634
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,206
and I'm like,
"Oh, I'm so nervous to open it."

635
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:56,517
- No.
- Ah...

636
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:02,000
Dang.

637
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:03,758
- That's okay.
- Don't you dare win?

638
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:05,896
<i>One of the things that
all of us here know now,</i>

639
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,931
<i>that Jeanine lost her vote
because she,</i>

640
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,517
for whatever reason,

641
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,689
risked her vote in order
to try to gain another advantage

642
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:15,758
in the game, which something
else that we know

643
00:30:15,862 --> 00:30:19,310
<i>is that Jeanine has
a hidden immunity idol as well.</i>

644
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:22,172
<i>It's just a funky
and crazy way to play,</i>

645
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:24,172
<i>'cause as soon
as somebody senses</i>

646
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:26,482
<i>that you're playing the game
harder than anybody else,</i>

647
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:28,206
nobody will mind
just getting rid of you,

648
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,793
'cause that's
one step closer to their dream.

649
00:30:38,827 --> 00:30:40,000
<i>Stella!</i>

650
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:42,344
- Yeah!
- Geo, come home!

651
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:45,344
<i>Tonight is gonna be</i>

652
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:46,413
pretty easy.

653
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:47,689
Welcome home.

654
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:49,724
<i>Me, Ryan, James and Karla</i>

655
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:51,896
<i>voting Cassidy out tonight.</i>

656
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,793
Welcome back, my guy.

657
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:57,000
<i>I don't want Cassidy
to know that I risked my vote.</i>

658
00:30:57,103 --> 00:30:58,413
I know she's
going home tonight,

659
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:00,137
but I still don't want her
to know what's going on.

660
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:03,137
It was just a floating platform
in the middle of the ocean.

661
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:05,275
We only had, like,
a few minutes,

662
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:07,344
- and because of the waves, it
was, like, all over the place.
- Yeah.

663
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:11,241
Yeah?

664
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:21,344
<i>My plan is to show my alliance
what is it that I got,</i>

665
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:22,862
<i>because I don't
want them to think</i>

666
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,551
that I'm trying anything shady
or anything like that.

667
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,310
I'm so excited for you, Geo.
I'm, like, shaking.

668
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:33,137
- I haven't opened it yet.
- Oh, my God, okay.

669
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:37,965
Yeah.

670
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:39,586
<i>The beauty of having Geo</i>

671
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,655
<i>trust me is that
he was too excited</i>

672
00:31:42,758 --> 00:31:44,862
to share that
he risked his vote--

673
00:31:44,965 --> 00:31:46,862
even though he lied to the tribe
and said that he didn't.

674
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:49,931
- You're the first person
I showed, but...
- Okay.

675
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:55,551
Oh, my gosh. I got it?

676
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,793
- I got it. I got it.
- Oh, my God.

677
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:19,103
Oh, my God.

678
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:20,931
This is what I came here for.

679
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:23,931
Like, I came to <i>Survivor</i> to get
an idol or to get an advantage.

680
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:27,206
<i>I've never seen anybody use the
Knowledge Is Power successfully,</i>

681
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,896
<i>but it's a very powerful tool,
and I'm gonna save it</i>

682
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,413
<i>in my little bank, and I'm gonna
use it later, because</i>

683
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:35,103
I'm not getting
voted out tonight.

684
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:36,758
- All three
of you risked it?
- All of us risked.

685
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:38,310
You are set.

686
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:40,689
<i>Discovering that Geo
has a Knowledge Is Power,</i>

687
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,310
of course I was excited.
I was like,

688
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:44,172
"Shoot. Someone could
make a really big move."

689
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:45,655
But then I paused, and I said,

690
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:47,689
"Yeah, someone could
make a really big move on me."

691
00:32:47,793 --> 00:32:50,241
<i>Does he know
that I have an idol?</i>

692
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,827
<i>Has he been wondering, what,</i>

693
00:32:51,931 --> 00:32:53,862
"We can't find one on
the island. Does Karla have one?

694
00:32:53,965 --> 00:32:55,655
Should I use this
against Karla tonight?"

695
00:32:55,758 --> 00:32:57,068
<i>I have to</i>

696
00:32:57,172 --> 00:32:58,827
do something about this.

697
00:32:58,931 --> 00:33:00,517
So, Geo did risk it.

698
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:03,724
I think Geo's
the best move right now.

699
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:08,275
I know it's scary,
but that's the game.

700
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:11,103
<i>I thought we had it
locked in, but my alliance</i>

701
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:12,551
got spooked at the last minute.

702
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:14,034
<i>They're like,
"Just trust me. Vote Geo,"</i>

703
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:15,655
<i>but I know I'm getting votes,</i>

704
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:17,344
<i>and if this Geo vote
doesn't work out,</i>

705
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:19,034
then I-I know I'm going home.

706
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:20,724
We have to take this shot.

707
00:33:20,827 --> 00:33:22,275
They're going after me.
We all know that.

708
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,172
If it was one of y'all's
name on the line,

709
00:33:24,275 --> 00:33:26,413
you'd also have concerns

710
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:27,793
- that you would want to bring up
- Let me tell you...

711
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:29,137
- and assess all the options.
- I know.

712
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,000
<i>Me and Karla want to vote Geo.</i>

713
00:33:31,103 --> 00:33:33,103
<i>Cassidy wants to vote Ryan.</i>

714
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:35,689
<i>She's just worried
that votes are coming her way.</i>

715
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:38,931
Why are people so afraid?

716
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:41,758
- We have numbers.
Like, it's a numbers game.
- I know.

717
00:33:41,862 --> 00:33:44,620
She is starting to freak out,
and this is...

718
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:47,344
I-I hope it's
not a Lindsay number two.

719
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:49,206
We're so close
to the freaking merge.

720
00:33:53,586 --> 00:33:55,344
<i>Me and Karla
are sitting there like, "Yo,</i>

721
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:56,724
we've had the same exact talk
with Lindsay

722
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,310
at the same exact place."

723
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:02,172
<i>She got paranoid and therefore
she got voted out.</i>

724
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:04,344
<i>And we thought
Cass was a cool customer,</i>

725
00:34:04,448 --> 00:34:06,379
but it's
the exact same situation.

726
00:34:06,482 --> 00:34:10,344
<i>It's very easy to say,
"Sorry, Cass, you can just go,"</i>

727
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,931
<i>but I also feel like
Geo does have an advantage,</i>

728
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:15,413
<i>and I'm like, "That's dangerous
to keep in the game."</i>

729
00:34:15,517 --> 00:34:17,379
<i>So I had
to figure out the best move</i>

730
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:19,344
<i>for me and Karla moving forward.</i>

731
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:45,448
All right, here's
my first question, Cassidy.

732
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,068
Can you feel momentum?

733
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,448
Like, if you're at a sporting
event and you feel it shift.

734
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:52,241
Or is momentum
merely a state of mind?

735
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:54,275
You know, I do
believe in momentum. I think

736
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:56,413
we had good momentum
coming into this game.

737
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:57,862
It shifted a little bit,

738
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:59,620
but that doesn't mean that
it can't change on a dime

739
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:01,000
and shift back into our favor,

740
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:02,103
and that's really
what I'm hoping for

741
00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:03,482
after this Tribal Council.

742
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:06,275
Ryan, what's
your take on momentum?

743
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:09,448
Um, I would have to say
it's a group effort.

744
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:12,172
It's synergy,
a way to move together.

745
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,448
And we had it in
the beginning of this challenge,

746
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:16,275
but at the end of it,
as an individual,

747
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:17,482
I think I dropped the ball--

748
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:19,551
quite literally,
with this challenge.

749
00:35:19,655 --> 00:35:21,310
Let's talk about that
for a second,

750
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:23,896
because in a challenge
like today,

751
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,655
where there were
so many layers to it,

752
00:35:25,758 --> 00:35:27,862
- Yeah.
- is it fair to put the blame

753
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:31,137
on the person who
literally dropped the ball?

754
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:35,000
You know, I told them, "Hey, if
my name needs to go out there,

755
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:37,310
"you know, I'm ready for it,

756
00:35:37,413 --> 00:35:39,724
as long as it keeps you guys
strong through the merge."

757
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:42,758
And I'll look back
over my shoulder, if it is me,

758
00:35:42,862 --> 00:35:44,310
and I'll give them a smile.

759
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:46,793
I don't have any hate,
no animosity.

760
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:50,310
I just want to enjoy my time
in Fiji as best as I can.

761
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:53,137
Cassidy, how was
that information received?

762
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:54,827
I mean, it's interesting because

763
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:58,206
for somebody to come in and be
so like, "It's okay if it's me.

764
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,689
I just want
what's best for the tribe."

765
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:01,551
That's just not normally
the type of game that you see.

766
00:36:01,655 --> 00:36:03,551
And, I mean,
I respect it if that's

767
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:05,931
the way that
he wants to play his game.

768
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:08,551
Um, I just don't know if I
would have done the same thing.

769
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:10,931
So, Ryan, is there
any concern that

770
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:12,896
putting the sword right here
and saying, "If you want me

771
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,896
to fall on it, I will,"
that they'll just push you?

772
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,275
Um, yeah, but I think
staying true to myself, like,

773
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,034
I've always been a giver,

774
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:25,517
and going out as a giver
isn't something I'm ashamed of.

775
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,482
So, Karla, is there
part of you just thinking,

776
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:32,137
"I'm sharpening my knife, right?
He's made it so easy.

777
00:36:32,241 --> 00:36:34,241
- He's going to lie down for me."
- Of course.

778
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:36,344
You just want it to be easy.

779
00:36:36,448 --> 00:36:38,758
I think an easy, an easy vote

780
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:42,551
- doesn't complicate things,
especially at Tribal.
- Mm.

781
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:44,137
And I can't imagine how
Geo feels just coming back,

782
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:46,827
and, like, just
getting all this information.

783
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:50,103
So, yeah, like, part of me
just is ready with the knives.

784
00:36:50,206 --> 00:36:51,862
Like, why not?

785
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:54,241
All right, Geo,
so you're not there

786
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:56,103
for this
early discussion, where...

787
00:36:56,206 --> 00:36:57,551
I'm trying
to catch up right now.

788
00:36:57,655 --> 00:36:58,862
I'm like, "What's going on?"

789
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:00,448
- Are you really?
- Yes.

790
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,896
So then, what are you
feeling right now?

791
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
- Are you solid or uneasy?
- Um...

792
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:08,586
I'm uneasy because I wasn't part
of many of these conversations

793
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:10,206
that probably happened
back in camp.

794
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,172
I just want
to make sure I vote

795
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:14,103
at the right direction,
'cause if I'm voting against

796
00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:16,137
all the votes, then all
the votes might be on me,

797
00:37:16,241 --> 00:37:18,689
and I might be
the next person going home,

798
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:19,931
and I'm not trying
to go home tonight.

799
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:21,551
James, did you ask Geo

800
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:23,827
- what happened on the journey?
- We didn't have to ask Geo.

801
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:25,448
Geo came and-and
just told us what happened.

802
00:37:25,551 --> 00:37:27,965
I mean, I feel like that's the
best way to move in this game,

803
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:30,241
because keeping
the information flowing

804
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:32,000
amongst each other,
especially when we're

805
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:34,103
going to be competing soon
in a merge.

806
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:37,931
So, Geo, how do you
use Tribal right now

807
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:39,862
to try to make sure
you're okay?

808
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:42,206
You just said, "I don't
even know who to vote for."

809
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,275
Well, you're scaring the crap
out of me right now,

810
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:46,137
like, telling me all this stuff.

811
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:47,517
- Wait, you've watched <i>
Survivor</i> before, right?
- But... I know.

812
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,793
Yes.

813
00:37:48,896 --> 00:37:50,206
This is not new.

814
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,827
But at this point,
it's critical for me to hear

815
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:54,724
everything and see everyone's
faces when they're talking,

816
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:56,448
'cause you don't know
who's telling the truth.

817
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:59,344
I really don't know what to do,
but I'm just gonna trust my gut

818
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:03,620
and hope that I can
be on the right side tonight.

819
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:07,068
Karla, is it possible
that Geo's telling the truth

820
00:38:07,172 --> 00:38:08,655
and that he really doesn't know

821
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:11,241
what the four of you are
talking about and planning?

822
00:38:16,965 --> 00:38:19,172
Yes. Uh, sorry. I'm...

823
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:21,655
I'm listening to the answers
and internalizing it.

824
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:25,068
I just hope that if anyone
would have gone on a journey

825
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:27,517
and come straight to Tribal,
that they really trust

826
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,517
in their alliance,
because that's really, I think,

827
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,758
the way that
you will survive Tribal.

828
00:38:31,862 --> 00:38:33,724
So, Ryan, as we
get ready for the vote,

829
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:36,620
if you're voted out tonight,
is your story gonna be,

830
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:39,241
"Hey, man, I put myself
in the money position.

831
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:41,448
I didn't deliver. They
voted me out, and that's fair."

832
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:44,034
I-I guess that's what
I'm gonna have to go home with.

833
00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:47,862
I feel more of the fact
of keeping the people

834
00:38:47,965 --> 00:38:51,068
that I care about as unified as
possible as I walk out the door.

835
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:53,620
So if people write your name
down, would you like them

836
00:38:53,724 --> 00:38:55,793
to put, like,
a little smiley face?

837
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:57,206
I would like them to say

838
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,896
what they liked most about me
to that camera.

839
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,620
- That's how I would...
- Okay.

840
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:02,517
I never know what the truth is,

841
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,275
but you've pitched it
pretty hard

842
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:06,379
that you're a kindhearted soul,

843
00:39:06,482 --> 00:39:08,034
and you just want to play

844
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,517
the game with love,
whether that means

845
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,517
you're out tonight or
you're there at the final three.

846
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,965
It's just, uh,
kill 'em with kindness.

847
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:17,068
It's what's been in my blood
since the day I was born.

848
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:20,034
Cassidy, if you survive
and the vote goes the way

849
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:22,413
you want it to go,
how will the tribe be different?

850
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:24,413
Um, I think
we'll be more unified.

851
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:26,068
I think with each vote

852
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:28,241
in the right direction,
you can kind of trust

853
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:30,206
your allies
a little bit more each time.

854
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,241
And so I think
it'll only strengthen

855
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:34,551
my alliance,
going into the merge.

856
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:40,586
All right, it is time to vote.
Geo, you're up.

857
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,827
I'm sure you're amazing,
but you have to go.

858
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,241
You think you can play me,
but the truth is

859
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:07,931
I'm the one that
put the blanks in your gun.

860
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:10,068
<i>I have the real bullets.</i>

861
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:22,827
If anyone has
an advantage or an idol

862
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:26,206
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

863
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:33,586
Okay, I'll read the votes.

864
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:37,931
First vote, Cassidy.

865
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:41,793
Cassidy.

866
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:43,620
Two votes Cassidy.

867
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:46,689
Geo.

868
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:49,000
That's two votes Cassidy,
one vote Geo.

869
00:40:52,896 --> 00:40:55,689
Geo. That's two votes Cassidy,
two votes Geo,

870
00:40:55,793 --> 00:40:57,137
one vote left.

871
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:07,793
Fifth person voted out
of <i>Survivor 43...</i>

872
00:41:07,896 --> 00:41:09,379
Geo.

873
00:41:09,482 --> 00:41:11,931
That's three.
You need to bring me your torch.

874
00:41:27,931 --> 00:41:30,379
Geo, the tribe has spoken.

875
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:34,241
Time for you to go.

876
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:44,586
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp. Good night.

879
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
- BYOB! Where's the party at?!
- Huh?

880
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:15,034
<i>The game is starting.</i>

881
00:42:15,137 --> 00:42:16,827
I am so excited.

882
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:18,344
<i>We're at Normandy here.</i>

883
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:19,758
... about to hit the fan.

884
00:42:19,862 --> 00:42:21,344
One final twist.

885
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:22,655
<i>Somebody's dream</i>

886
00:42:22,758 --> 00:42:23,896
is going to end.

887
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,275
There's nowhere
to hide right now.

888
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm scared to death
at what's coming next.

889
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,068
Wow. You can't trust
nobody around here.

890
00:42:33,172 --> 00:42:35,586
<i>I just got blindsided,
but it's part of the game.</i>

891
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:37,137
<i>It's</i> Survivor.

892
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:38,862
<i>I'm going home with
a little souvenir in my pocket,</i>

893
00:42:38,965 --> 00:42:41,034
<i>and I'm happy
with the game that I played.</i>

894
00:42:41,137 --> 00:42:42,724
<i>I might have played
a little too hard,</i>

895
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:44,310
<i>but that's fine,
because if you don't come</i>

896
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:46,103
<i>to</i> Survivor <i>and play hard,</i>

897
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:49,034
then there's no point of coming
to <i>Survivor.</i> It's pointless.
