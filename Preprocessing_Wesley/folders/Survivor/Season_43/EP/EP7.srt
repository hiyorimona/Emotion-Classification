1
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:24,241
<i>I'm still reeling from
what happened at Tribal tonight.</i>

2
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:26,344
<i>Elie, my number one ally,</i>

3
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:27,413
ended up getting voted out,

4
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:30,931
and I was completely blindsided.

5
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,551
Sixth person voted out
of <i>Survivor 43...</i>

6
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:36,931
- Elie.
- Dang.

7
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:42,000
Y'all see what
trusting Gabler will get you?

8
00:00:42,103 --> 00:00:43,000
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

9
00:00:43,103 --> 00:00:44,793
Right back at you.

10
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:50,620
<i>You never hope to be that person
that is left out of the vote.</i>

11
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:53,724
And just that
initial feeling of, like,

12
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:57,482
"Oh, my God,
I am on the outside,

13
00:00:57,586 --> 00:01:01,206
and people didn't tell me
this crucial information."

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,448
I-I understand.

15
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,068
I was literally
in your position.

16
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:07,206
I know. This is the same thing
that happened with Justine. I...

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,517
- It is,
but the good thing is...
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,482
- ...this has nothing to do
with you and your game.
- Okay. Okay.

19
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:14,862
If anything, I mean, how
I learned, it bettered my game.

20
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:17,413
- Yeah.
- I believe this will help you.

21
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:19,482
- And my advice,
like, how to handle it...
- Yeah. Yeah.

22
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:21,206
- ...like, how I handled it...
- Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,655
Like, you act like it's okay.

24
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:24,206
- Yeah. Of course. Yeah.
- You don't... Yeah.

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,655
- Because... No, yeah.
- I'm not, I'm not upset.
I'm not.

26
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:26,931
- No, yeah, yeah...
- Yeah, exactly.

27
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:30,793
I just feel
really confused and alone,

28
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:33,206
<i>but I feel like right now</i>

29
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,896
I need to pretend like this
is the best thing for my game.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,241
I am so good.

31
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:41,206
Like, I-I know
that this is gonna free me.

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,034
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It was already
putting a target on my back.

33
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,275
But this is gonna be
a blessing in disguise,

34
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,448
because it allows me
to just play my own game.

35
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:49,827
I don't want you to think

36
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:51,931
that I'm tied to Elie
in any way and that...

37
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:54,068
- We're good. 100%.
- Oh, 100%.

38
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:56,172
It's gonna free me
to play my own game.

39
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:57,724
This is great for your game, honestly.

40
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,413
- Yes.
- Everyone could see that

41
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:01,275
y'all two were inseparable.

42
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:12,655
<i>Everyone has told me I'm okay,</i>

43
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,241
but I just want to cry.

44
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:20,068
Yeah.

45
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,689
Ryan's just stomping on crabs.

46
00:02:32,724 --> 00:02:34,724
That guy's got endless energy.

47
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:35,862
He does.

48
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:42,482
Okay.

49
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:45,137
Yeah, yeah.

50
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,827
Yeah.

51
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:55,655
Yeah.

52
00:02:57,793 --> 00:03:00,482
<i>I wanted
to utilize the Baka five</i>

53
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:02,034
<i>that we had
worked so hard to keep.</i>

54
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:03,275
"Keep the five alive."

55
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,137
That's what we've
been saying for days.

56
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:08,206
<i>But it turns out
Gabler is on the war path.</i>

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,310
He is a loose cannon,
and after the fiasco

58
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:14,551
<i>with the Elie situation,
it's a bull in a china shop.</i>

59
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:18,034
Yeah.

60
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:19,655
Not even trying to... Yeah.

61
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,482
Yeah. It's like, "Oh, we worked
so hard to keep five of us."

62
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:26,413
- I mean, like...
- He's just like, "Screw it."

63
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:28,068
It's like
we've invited the entire tribe

64
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,965
to come view the Grand Canyon

65
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:32,413
that is the crack
in the Baka alliance.

66
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:35,689
<i>And Gabler definitely
raises some red flags</i>

67
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:39,689
<i>about keeping him in my alliance
for the long haul.</i>

68
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,586
'Cause who knows
what he could do next?

69
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,275
I woke up this morning, I looked
at the sunrise, and I'm like,

70
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,724
"Ah."

71
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,655
Yeah, I mean, it's a...

72
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:50,586
She was just
a dangerous player, man.

73
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,137
It's a better day on the beach.

74
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,724
More peaceful day
on the beach, for sure.

75
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:55,137
That's important.

76
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,103
I just put my idol...
Now-now defunct, right?

77
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:59,413
So I just took it
and put it right back in here.

78
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:02,103
<i>Last night I didn't
play my idol. I didn't have to.</i>

79
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:03,655
<i>And now it's expired.</i>

80
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:05,758
<i>On top of that,
the plan that I hatched,</i>

81
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:07,344
<i>that I wanted
to have happen, happened.</i>

82
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,827
"Alli-Gabler" kind of came up
to the surface, came over there.

83
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,931
<i>I didn't trust Elie.
We took her out.</i>

84
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:15,827
Now I plan
to go underwater again

85
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:17,448
<i>and just chill,</i>

86
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:19,448
<i>and then pop back up so
I'm not perceived as a threat.</i>

87
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,344
But when the time is right,
I'm ready to strike.

88
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:23,896
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey, guys.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,793
- Come down to the beach.
- Come to the beach.

90
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:27,206
We got a little
something-something.

91
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,137
- Oh, shoot. Let's do this.
- Okay.

92
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,103
Art project!

93
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,482
We got tree mail.

94
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:35,413
<i>So we get tree mail.</i>

95
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:36,896
We're all thinking, oh, there's
gonna be something, like,

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,344
something happy of like,
"Hooray, y'all made the merge.

97
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:39,689
Go paint
your tribe flag together."

98
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,344
Oh... [chuckles] Okay.

99
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,586
Absolutely not.

100
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:49,965
Yes.

101
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,862
Oh.

102
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,310
Oh.

103
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,724
What the hell?

104
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:02,724
- "You must divide"?
- Six pairs.

105
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:04,241
We must divide?

106
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:06,517
- We choose?
- I guess so.

107
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,137
<i>We're gonna be pairing up
for this immunity challenge.</i>

108
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,655
So that, to me,
is tremendously awkward.

109
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:13,793
Uh...

110
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,310
How do we...?

111
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:16,896
- How do we do this?
- Ah, geez.

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,137
That's awkward.

113
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:19,931
No one wants to say,

114
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:22,586
<i>"Oh, I want to go with Ryan."
"Oh, I want to go with Cody."</i>

115
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,793
<i>No one wants to
officially make the decision</i>

116
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:28,172
of even the methodology
of how we're choosing partners.

117
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:29,689
- That is not
what I was expecting at all.
- Yeah.

118
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:31,965
I thought it'd be
a lot more peaceful.

119
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:35,172
Well, I mean,
at the end of the day...

120
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:36,620
- We don't know
what the challenge is.
- We don't know what it is.

121
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:38,310
Yeah, we don't know what it is.

122
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:41,034
We're just forced to break up
into pairs to compete for what?

123
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:42,620
Are we competing for a reward?

124
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:44,551
Are we competing for two of us
to win immunity?

125
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:45,724
<i>Are we competing
against each other?</i>

126
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:47,241
<i>What's happening?</i>

127
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:48,931
<i>None of us know
what to do at this point.</i>

128
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:53,172
Really awkward.

129
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:56,103
It just brings me
back to middle school.

130
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:58,000
<i>Everyone feels self-conscious.</i>

131
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,517
- This sucks.
- This is awkward.

132
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:01,862
I don't know.

133
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:02,862
Sure.

134
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:04,241
I like that idea.

135
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,448
It was a really interesting
five-second social experiment

136
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:11,931
<i>before all of us just said,
"Let's draw rocks." [chuckles]</i>

137
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:13,482
I'm nervous.

138
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:14,620
All right.

139
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:18,206
All right.

140
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,551
Ooh!

141
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:20,517
Okay.

142
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,034
Here we go.

143
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:23,034
All right.

144
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:25,172
Three, two, one, go.

145
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:43,931
Come on in.

146
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:58,586
All right, day 14.

147
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,000
Shall we get into it?

148
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,655
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.
- All right.

149
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:03,344
Today in tree mail,
you received a note

150
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:05,172
telling you
to divide up into pairs.

151
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:06,620
How did that go, Karla?

152
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:10,793
Um, we painted two rocks
with the same color to equal 12.

153
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,931
- And so we pulled rocks.
- All right.

154
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,275
I like it.
Let's divide into pairs.

155
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,241
Just starting down here,
get next to your partner,

156
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:18,172
so we can see who's with who.

157
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:22,137
Okay.

158
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,689
So we have Owen and Gabler,

159
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,068
Cody and Dwight,

160
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:27,034
Noelle and Sami,

161
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:29,034
Ryan and James,

162
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:30,827
Karla and Cassidy,

163
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:33,034
and Jesse and Jeanine.

164
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:34,689
How do you feel
about these pairs?

165
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:36,827
- Everybody basically happy?
- Yeah.

166
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:37,965
- I think we all feel good.
- I'm happy.

167
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:39,310
All right,
for today's challenge,

168
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:40,620
we're doing
something a little different.

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,103
Today's challenge
will be run in three stages.

170
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:49,344
<i>You got to make the cut
in order to make the next stage.</i>

171
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,758
<i>For the first stage,
you're gonna crawl</i>

172
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:55,137
<i>through a muddy, twisted net.</i>

173
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,000
<i>You'll then dig up planks
and race back to your mat.</i>

174
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,862
<i>The first four pairs
to plant their flag in their mat</i>

175
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,586
<i>move on to the next stage.</i>

176
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,551
The last two pairs are out.

177
00:08:05,655 --> 00:08:06,931
No shot at immunity.

178
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,172
For the second stage,

179
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,965
<i>you're gonna race up</i>

180
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:13,275
<i>a cargo net and use those
planks to cross a rope bridge.</i>

181
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:15,241
<i>You got to get both players
and all three planks</i>

182
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:17,827
<i>to the other side,
then drop down the wall</i>

183
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,517
<i>and race to your mat.</i>

184
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,689
The first two pairs to finish
move on to the final stage.

185
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:26,275
The last two pairs, they're out.

186
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,655
No shot at immunity.

187
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,827
For the final stage,
the pairs are over.

188
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:34,551
<i>You're now four individuals
competing against each other.</i>

189
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:37,103
<i>You'll hold on to a handle
which is attached</i>

190
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:41,310
<i>to a bucket that contains
25% of your pregame weight.</i>

191
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:44,827
<i>And as your hands fatigue,
that bucket will lower.</i>

192
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:47,310
<i>When it finally drops
and smashes the tile...</i>

193
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:49,689
<i>you're out.</i>

194
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:52,586
Last person left standing
wins immunity.

195
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,241
Tonight
you'll be wearing this...

196
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:56,551
...at Tribal Council.

197
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:59,793
This means you are safe,
cannot be voted out.

198
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:01,896
- Guaranteed a spot
in the final 11.
- Wow.

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,793
Losers, Tribal Council,

200
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:05,413
where somebody
will be the seventh person

201
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:08,068
voted out of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

202
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,482
All right,
we're gonna draw for spots,

203
00:09:09,586 --> 00:09:10,862
and I'll give you
a minute to strategize.

204
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:13,724
We'll get started.
Let's do it.

205
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,172
Here we go.

206
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:24,275
First four pairs
move on to the next stage.

207
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:25,586
Survivors ready?

208
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,551
- Go!
- Let's go, Jesse!
- Good job, Owen!

209
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:33,103
It's gonna be Cassidy,
Ryan, Jesse, Cody...

210
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:36,068
- You got it, bro.
- ...Owen and Sami
going through first.

211
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:37,724
Here we go, Sami!

212
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,310
Your partner can't go
until you get through.

213
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,896
It is a twisted, muddy net.

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,655
It looks so easy
for those first five paces.

215
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:45,793
Roll!

216
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,413
Cassidy's
gonna be first through.

217
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:54,965
- Go, Karla!
- Let's go, baby!

218
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:58,241
It is Cassidy and Karla
in the lead right now.

219
00:09:58,344 --> 00:09:59,793
You're good.

220
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:02,586
Ryan's through. Go.

221
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:05,137
James is in. Sami's good.

222
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:07,137
- Go, Noelle.
- You got it, Noelle.

223
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,586
Noelle now in the net.

224
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:20,517
There goes Karla
working through it.

225
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,793
Yeah, keep rolling,
keep rolling, keep rolling.

226
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:23,862
I'll tell you when you're done.

227
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:26,172
James working that net.

228
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,448
Super aggressive
with how he's doing that.

229
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:32,034
James has a lot of energy now.
That is how you do it.

230
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:34,206
James is through. You're good.

231
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,137
- It is James and Ryan
in the lead.
- Let's go. Let's go.

232
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:37,448
Both of you are digging.

233
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:41,551
- Now it's Cody really trying
to get something going.
- Yes!

234
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:42,758
Yes!

235
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:44,620
There you go, Cody.
Dwight's now in.

236
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:46,758
We're looking for four pairs.

237
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:48,793
You're good, Owen. Go, Gabler.

238
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,896
Keep rolling, Karla.
You're almost there!

239
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,827
- Here comes Karla!
- Good job!

240
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,482
- That's
how you do it, Karla.
- Let's go.

241
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:55,862
Let's go, Karla, Cassidy.

242
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,896
You're good.
Start digging.

243
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:01,275
- Ah.
- Dwight working.

244
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,172
Keep spinning, Dwight.

245
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:04,413
Keep spinning.

246
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:07,586
You got to spin, bro.

247
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:08,689
That's the only way
you're gonna get through there.

248
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,620
Dang it.

249
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:12,241
Noelle is working.

250
00:11:12,344 --> 00:11:14,275
- She is stuck.
- Keep going, Noelle.

251
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,344
Noelle is taking
her leg off mid-challenge.

252
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,034
Amazing.

253
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:22,068
- Jeff!
- Jeff!

254
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:24,034
James, Ryan, you're good.

255
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:26,241
We're looking
for three more pairs.

256
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:27,689
Get to the mat! Get to the mat!

257
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:29,551
There you go. Jesse.
You're good.

258
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,931
Jeanine now on the course.

259
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:33,034
She was
the last to get in there.

260
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:34,551
She's gonna
have to make up some time.

261
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:36,000
You got it, Jeanine. You got it.

262
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,482
Let's go. Let's go.

263
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:39,172
You're good. Start digging.

264
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:40,931
It is now Owen
and Gabler digging.

265
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:43,896
- You're good.
- You're good.
Start digging.

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,517
Dwight and Cody, let's go.

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,172
- There it is, Karla.
- Help me, help me. Come on.

268
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,551
Karla and Cassidy have theirs.

269
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,758
Get back with the flag.

270
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:54,586
Owen and Gabler have theirs.
Get back with the flag.

271
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:56,724
- Gabler.
- You're good.
Karla, Cassidy have moved on.

272
00:11:57,931 --> 00:11:59,862
You got to get all the way.

273
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:01,931
Three's three.
Owen and Gabler have moved on.

274
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:03,965
We're looking for one more.

275
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:06,724
Keep digging, Noelle.
Keep digging.

276
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:11,551
Right now it looks like
it's going to be Dwight and Cody

277
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:14,034
because Jeanine
and Noelle are both stuck.

278
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,206
Cannot get out.

279
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:20,034
It looks so easy
to just crawl through,

280
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:21,896
- but it's not.
- We're almost there.

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,344
Right here.

282
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:27,689
The fourth pair
that's gonna move on,

283
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,000
Cody and Dwight.

284
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:30,206
There it is.

285
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:35,931
Cassidy, Karla,
James, Ryan, Dwight,

286
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:39,000
Cody, and Owen and Gabler
move on. Everybody else is out.

287
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:40,931
Help your tribemates get out.

288
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:42,206
I'm so sorry, Sami.

289
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,275
Stop it. You're good.

290
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:47,758
- Jesse... I'm so sorry.
- It's all good.

291
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:49,793
- No, no, it's all right.
- I'm so sorry.

292
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:54,482
They'll get you out, Noelle.
You are not alone.

293
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:56,310
That was a difficult challenge.

294
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:57,896
- We tried our best.
- It's all good.

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's all we can do.

296
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:00,689
I love seeing this.

297
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:04,172
On day 14,
in a million-dollar game,

298
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,000
everybody helping everyone.

299
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:07,758
We got you.

300
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,413
Stop.

301
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,379
We're good. I didn't want
to hold on to no damn bucket.

302
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:18,551
Way to battle. Everybody.

303
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:20,137
Good job, Jeanine.

304
00:13:21,137 --> 00:13:22,862
Yeah. Thank you, guys.

305
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:24,482
You look like a warrior.

306
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,862
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job.

307
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,103
Sami, you were
the first to get in there,

308
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:30,310
and you were the first to say,

309
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:32,379
"I didn't want
to hang on to a bucket,"

310
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:35,551
basically implying, "I don't
care. I care about you."

311
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:38,758
- Yeah.
- I'm noticing this
more and more in this game,

312
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:41,620
that you are all obviously
fighting for a million dollars,

313
00:13:41,724 --> 00:13:45,103
everybody here wants it, and yet
you still have the capacity

314
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:48,206
and the empathy to say,
"But we got to help Noelle."

315
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,379
We all went through that,
literally through the ringer.

316
00:13:50,482 --> 00:13:53,379
And for Noelle to do it,
for the sake of giving me

317
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:56,206
a chance to compete
and to further myself

318
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,103
- in this game,
that's all it means to me.
- Oh, yeah.

319
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:00,172
So that was,
that was warrior effort.

320
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,965
Beast mode.

321
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:03,448
It's tough because
if this was individual,

322
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,310
I-I wouldn't
be beating myself up as much.

323
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,344
But, I mean,
I'm doing it as a team.

324
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,896
I'm doing it with him.
Like, I want him to succeed.

325
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
- More than me.
- And that means the most to me.
That's all that matters to me.

326
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:15,034
- She got through it.
- I mean, these guys, they're
the ones giving me inspiration.

327
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:17,379
And it's... it just... it...

328
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,620
This is like the first time
I've been emotional out here.

329
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:20,965
I mean, that sucked.

330
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,551
Incredible, Noelle.

331
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:24,620
- Yeah.
- You are inspiring.

332
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:26,551
All right. I love the love.
The game continues.

333
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:29,206
The four winning pairs, let's
reset and we'll keep going.

334
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,827
So, I'm gonna remind you

335
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:42,448
what you're
gonna do in this stage.

336
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:45,620
<i>You're gonna be taking
your planks up that cargo net.</i>

337
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,689
<i>When you get to the top,
there's a rope bridge.</i>

338
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:50,137
<i>You're gonna use
the three planks to cross it.</i>

339
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:53,000
<i>You got to get both your bodies
and all three planks</i>

340
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:55,896
to the other side,
then you get to your mat,

341
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,275
because only
the first two pairs move on.

342
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,896
The last two pairs are out.
Sound good?

343
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,034
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

344
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,310
All right, here we go.

345
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:04,931
Survivors ready?

346
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:06,241
Go!

347
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:09,586
Moving up that net.

348
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:11,620
Okay.

349
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:15,413
Everybody's up top.

350
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:18,137
Now comes the teamwork.
Cassidy using her teeth.

351
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:20,310
Once you get those planks free,

352
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:21,862
you can start
across the rope bridge.

353
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:24,896
There's no time to waste here.

354
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:29,620
This is a sprint on day 14.

355
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:33,275
It is Ryan and James
once again in the lead.

356
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,034
Cody and Dwight
right on their tail.

357
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:38,000
Here's Cassidy and Karla
and Owen and Gabler.

358
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,517
Six men, two women.

359
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:43,827
Both the women working together.

360
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:48,620
It is now Dwight and Cody.

361
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:51,310
Great teamwork.
Doing it two at once.

362
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:53,965
Lower.

363
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:55,931
Ryan and James,
it's just balancing.

364
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:02,103
It's gonna be Dwight and Cody.

365
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:03,827
They're gonna get across first.

366
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,655
- But you got to get
all the planks.
- Give me the planks.

367
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,896
- Go ahead.
- You're good with one.
There's two. You're good.

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,206
Get down the other side.

369
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,689
Cody and Dwight.

370
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:11,896
- Yeah, baby!
- Let's go!

371
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,206
They're moving on!

372
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,862
Yes!

373
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:15,862
Good job, guys.

374
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:18,206
Hold on to that bucket, boys.

375
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,517
- Smooth, bro! Smooth!
- Dude.

376
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,862
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

377
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:22,965
We're looking for one more pair.

378
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:25,896
Keep digging! Let's go!
Right now!

379
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,172
- It's Cassidy and Karla.
- Give me your hand.

380
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:28,724
Give me your hand.

381
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:30,103
You got to get the planks.
Owen and Gabler.

382
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:32,482
There's James and Ryan.

383
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,103
This is gonna be close!

384
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:36,103
Oh! Karla falls!

385
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:38,413
That's it.
They've got to start over.

386
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,206
- Here.
- You got to get all the planks.

387
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,965
Who's gonna be there?
They dropped! They're out!

388
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:49,689
Owen and Gabler move on.

389
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:52,896
- What a finish.
- Gabler with the barrel roll.

390
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,275
With the barrel roll.

391
00:16:55,896 --> 00:16:58,344
Two pairs collapsed
at the last second.

392
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:02,931
Karla fell, and Ryan and James
have lost one of their planks.

393
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:05,793
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Bro, bro, bro...

394
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:07,517
I didn't look at them, bro.

395
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,689
All right, losers, take
a spot on the sit-out bench.

396
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:14,206
For the final round,

397
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,482
it's gonna be Cody and Dwight
and Gabler and Owen.

398
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:18,586
All right, let's do this.
Take your spots.

399
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:25,103
So, everybody has 25% of their
body weight in their bucket.

400
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:27,689
The way the challenge works is,
when we start,

401
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:32,172
you put your hands on the bar,
palms down, knuckles up,

402
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:34,137
and you're gonna
pull back toward you.

403
00:17:34,241 --> 00:17:36,172
That's gonna
release the mechanism

404
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:38,275
that is
holding the bucket right now.

405
00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:40,034
When you hit the tile,
you're out.

406
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:42,551
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

407
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,068
guaranteed one in 11.

408
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:46,482
All right, everybody
put your hands on the bar.

409
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,448
When I tell you to,
pull it back towards your body,

410
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:51,689
and this challenge is on.

411
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:54,620
Three, two, one. Pull it back.

412
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:02,000
Everybody is good,
and this challenge is on.

413
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:07,448
All you have to do is
keep your bucket up in the air

414
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:10,068
longer than the other three

415
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,862
and this beautiful
immunity necklace is yours.

416
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,034
We've had men
win this challenge.

417
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,241
We've had women
win this challenge.

418
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:20,896
This comes down
to pure endurance.

419
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,931
How badly do you want it?

420
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,482
Nothing is easy out here.

421
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:32,620
Just to get to this position,
you had to work.

422
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:36,724
This is a challenge where you're
going to reach a breaking point.

423
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:41,724
Fatigue takes
over your entire body.

424
00:18:41,827 --> 00:18:45,517
Just slowly,
it starts to inch its way down

425
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,379
and it gets so far
that you can't recover.

426
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:51,517
Dwight's bucket dropping.

427
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:55,827
This is that moment, Dwight.

428
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:57,551
You feel it
slipping away, literally,

429
00:18:57,655 --> 00:18:59,206
slipping through your hands.

430
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,655
You've got to dig in that grip.
Your forearms are burning.

431
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:04,931
Your body's exhausted.

432
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:10,482
- Dwight drops.
- Great job, Dwight.

433
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:12,137
- Dwight
is the first person out.
- Nice work, Dwight.

434
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,931
No shot at immunity.

435
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:16,896
We're down to three.

436
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,172
It is Gabler, Owen and Cody.

437
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:23,275
Holding 25%,
a quarter of your body weight.

438
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:27,517
What are you
digging on right now, Gabler?

439
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,517
What are you
using for inspiration?

440
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,275
My uncle had heart surgery...
last week.

441
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:35,896
Heart team I know worked on him.

442
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,172
Sure he's doing fine.

443
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,655
How about you, Owen?
What do you draw on right now?

444
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:45,137
Wearing that necklace.

445
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,896
That's my, that's my dream
as a little kid, man.

446
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,482
Just want to win.
Give it everything I got.

447
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,862
How about you, Cody?

448
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,862
Jeff, I lost a wrestling match

449
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:59,034
my senior year of high school
to go to State.

450
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:02,034
I've regretted
that moment my entire life.

451
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:03,344
Wow.

452
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:06,413
And this is my opportunity
to redeem myself.

453
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:12,793
Three very personal stories,

454
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:15,241
all with the same purpose--

455
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:18,758
give you what you need
to keep that bucket in the air.

456
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:22,862
This next minute's for Noelle.

457
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:25,862
She's inspired me
throughout this whole challenge.

458
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:28,724
I admire the minute-by-minute
fresh inspiration.

459
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:33,344
Been out here 23 minutes.

460
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:36,586
That is a long time
to be doing this.

461
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:38,000
- Great job.
- You're doing great.

462
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,551
I can do this all day.

463
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,275
Gabler, for the first time,

464
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:52,655
his bucket dropping
and quickly pulls it back up.

465
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,206
There we go.

466
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:58,137
Little movement by Owen now.

467
00:20:58,241 --> 00:20:59,413
Ah.

468
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,206
Owen trying to pull
his bucket back up again.

469
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:07,034
Digging in.

470
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:08,758
Digging.

471
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:13,310
Owen starting to drop again.

472
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:15,931
Hovering in that 50% spot.

473
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,275
- Owen drops. Owen is out.
- Good job, Owen.

474
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,413
- Great job, Owen.
- Good job, Owen!
- Good job, Owen.

475
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:24,103
Owen, take a spot on the bench.
We're down to two.

476
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:27,965
It is now Gabler versus Cody
in a showdown.

477
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:30,310
Cody's got his head down.

478
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,000
Gabler locked in.

479
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:35,724
You're at 24 minutes.

480
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,310
Damn.

481
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:40,241
The longest anybody
has gone in this challenge--

482
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:42,310
25 minutes.

483
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:43,827
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Ooh.

484
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:45,931
- You're so close.
- Let's go.

485
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:47,482
We will break the record, Cody.
Hang in there, buddy.

486
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:50,344
I've been married
for almost 25 years.

487
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:52,758
I'm at least going 25.

488
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,344
Minute by minute,
Gabler working it.

489
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,448
Let's do this next minute
for Lester Tenney.

490
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:05,965
He's a war hero, passed now.

491
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:09,758
Survived the Bataan Death March.
Went to a prison camp.

492
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,206
Five years in captivity.
Made it home.

493
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,586
Found out his family
was told he was dead.

494
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:16,379
His wife remarried.

495
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:18,724
He had to remake his life.

496
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:21,034
Lester was one of our patients.

497
00:22:22,034 --> 00:22:23,689
We fixed him.

498
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:27,137
I got to know Lester
for six great years.

499
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:30,379
I could do this
all day for Lester.

500
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,724
A lot of heroes

501
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:36,448
served in our military.

502
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,172
We do this for fun.

503
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,689
They did this for real.

504
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:43,827
- Love you, Gabler.
- Been up here
a long time.

505
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:45,137
Hell yeah, bro.

506
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:46,758
25 minutes and counting.

507
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:48,517
Yes, sir.

508
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,241
This challenge
has now lasted longer

509
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:54,379
- than it ever has
in any other season.
- Attaboys.

510
00:22:54,482 --> 00:22:56,620
It does not get any easier.

511
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:58,620
Hell yeah, bro.

512
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:00,448
Every minute earned.

513
00:23:05,172 --> 00:23:08,620
This one's for my dog,
my furry-faced son.

514
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,689
32 minutes
you've been up there now.

515
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,896
This next minute's for Idaho.

516
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,172
This next minute's for Alaska.

517
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:21,103
I got some Navy SEAL buddies
that I went to high school with,

518
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:22,931
and this minute is for you.

519
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:25,482
I know a small man.

520
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:28,724
He had the same name of these
Louisiana forest sprites...

521
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:30,758
- Oh.
- Muzzy.
They call 'em "Muzzies."

522
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:32,310
And he, uh, was my roommate.

523
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:37,000
- 37 minutes. A new record.
- Yeah!

524
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:38,862
- Wow.
- And in the last five
of those minutes,

525
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:41,275
both of
your buckets have slowly...

526
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:44,103
...inched closer to the bottom.

527
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:48,965
Gabler immediately
notices his bucket.

528
00:23:49,068 --> 00:23:50,758
There goes Cody
pulling his bucket back up.

529
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,241
- Let's go, Cody.
- Let's go, boys.

530
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:55,862
Both guys digging in now.
38 minutes.

531
00:23:55,965 --> 00:23:58,724
Those forearms starting
to really ache.

532
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:00,517
Dig, Cody.

533
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,275
This is why you came here--
for this.

534
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:05,137
Keep it going. Keep it going.

535
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:07,241
Cody drops a little more.

536
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:10,862
Getting dangerously close
to being out of this challenge.

537
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:12,586
Oh, no. Oh, no.

538
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:17,551
Cody drops.

539
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:20,620
Gabler wins
individual immunity.

540
00:24:20,724 --> 00:24:22,655
Safe tonight at Tribal Council.

541
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:24,034
- Nice job, Gabler.
- Good job, Gabler.

542
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:25,137
What an effort.

543
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,586
In a three-stage battle.

544
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:32,965
Gabler, come on over here.

545
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,517
Man, you're feeling it.

546
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,517
Dude, I could have gone...

547
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,793
I was going for 51.

548
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,827
All right, Gabler.

549
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:43,586
This is incredible.
Is this happening?

550
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:46,448
- It's happening.
- Don't wake me up.
Don't wake me up.

551
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,103
- Man, you look handsome.
- Congratulations.
You are caked in mud,

552
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:51,344
but you are wearing the only
thing that matters right now,

553
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,137
the individual
immunity necklace.

554
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,655
With this around your neck,

555
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:56,482
you are safe tonight
at Tribal Council.

556
00:24:56,586 --> 00:24:58,655
- Thank you, Jeff.
- As for the rest of you,
somebody's dream

557
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:01,586
of winning <i>Survivor 43</i>
will come to an end.

558
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:04,275
Tribal Council tonight. Somebody
the seventh person voted out.

559
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,551
You grab your stuff, head out.
I'll see you tonight at Tribal.

560
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,172
- Well-earned.
- Thank you. Thank you, Jeff.

561
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,482
<i>I didn't know I could do that.</i>

562
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:14,413
All I can say is,
if you even think for a second

563
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:16,793
that you want to do this, do it.

564
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:19,068
<i>You'll find power in yourself.</i>

565
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:22,482
This could be waiting for you,
right here. Do it.

566
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,586
<i>- Congratulations.
- Good job, man.</i>

567
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:35,724
Thank you.

568
00:25:39,344 --> 00:25:40,724
<i>In that challenge,</i>

569
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:43,586
<i>I was so inspired
by the people I was channeling,</i>

570
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:45,965
<i>because I'm playing</i> Survivor

571
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:49,724
for veterans who are suffering
from traumatic brain injuries,

572
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:51,517
who are suffering from PTSD.

573
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,758
<i>The veteran community has been
very special to me all my life.</i>

574
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:58,862
<i>My dad served and my uncles.</i>

575
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:01,206
<i>So I have
a military family background.</i>

576
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,724
<i>And until recently,</i>

577
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,034
<i>PTSD was something that
just came from the battlefield.</i>

578
00:26:05,137 --> 00:26:06,724
<i>But trauma is trauma.</i>

579
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:10,931
PTSD rings true with me because
I work in the operating room.

580
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:12,448
<i>I've been in thousands of cases.</i>

581
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,448
<i>However,
sometimes things go wrong,</i>

582
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:16,241
<i>and there's
a patient on the table,</i>

583
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:18,724
<i>somebody's grandfather,
somebody's, you know, son.</i>

584
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,689
<i>There are some cases
that were 17 years ago</i>

585
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:22,965
<i>that I carry with me today.</i>

586
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:25,965
<i>Veterans are
one percent of our population</i>

587
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:28,482
<i>that take care of our 99%.</i>

588
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:32,620
So if I can give 100% for them,

589
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:35,896
then I'll be, then I'll be
very proud and happy about that.

590
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:43,206
Oh!

591
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,379
- Same here.
- Yeah.

592
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,034
<i>At the last Tribal Council,
not even everybody</i>

593
00:26:51,137 --> 00:26:52,586
<i>was eligible to be voted for.</i>

594
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:54,896
Over half
of the players were safe,

595
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,482
while the other half
of us were not.

596
00:26:57,586 --> 00:26:59,137
<i>Now things get interesting.</i>

597
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:00,620
<i>Now things open up,</i>

598
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:04,172
<i>and we really see
who's going with who.</i>

599
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:08,586
I haven't heard any names yet.

600
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:11,758
Yes, we do.

601
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:20,413
<i>Yeah.</i>

602
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:23,448
Socially...

603
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:27,206
So...

604
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:34,413
Oh.

605
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:38,379
What the heck
is that in there, yo?

606
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:39,931
Oh, what? Oh...

607
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:43,103
- Sorry.
- You're good, bro.

608
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:44,655
I guess we're
together with this.

609
00:27:44,758 --> 00:27:46,379
Damn.

610
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,034
Does anybody want it, though,
first and foremost?

611
00:27:57,137 --> 00:27:58,034
Hell no.

612
00:27:58,137 --> 00:27:59,482
Exactly.

613
00:27:59,586 --> 00:28:01,413
- So, this is the thing.
<i>- Oh, shoot.</i>

614
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:03,206
<i>Like, I'm regretting
everything at this moment,</i>

615
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,724
just because I definitely put
a potential target on my back.

616
00:28:05,827 --> 00:28:07,586
I mean, at the end of the day,
everybody gets nervous.

617
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:09,551
You know? And then
all you need is one extra thing.

618
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:10,586
"James has this."

619
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,689
We all know about it.

620
00:28:14,137 --> 00:28:16,310
<i>The note says there's an
advantage hidden under camp.</i>

621
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:18,068
<i>I was gonna wait
until after Tribal, but...</i>

622
00:28:18,172 --> 00:28:19,344
it's <i>Survivor.</i>
... that.

623
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:24,689
<i>Curiosity got the best of me.</i>

624
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:26,275
<i>And also everybody knew
where it was at.</i>

625
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:29,206
<i>It may not be there by the time
Tribal happens, so...</i>

626
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,000
<i>Or they can vote me out
and just take it.</i>

627
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:33,172
So I figured,
let me just get it now.

628
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:34,275
So...

629
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:42,965
A bottle in the well.

630
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,965
<i>I'm just thinking,
"Okay, James has something."</i>

631
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:48,103
I was deciding
who I wanted to vote for.

632
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:50,689
It was either Ryan or James
and what benefited my game.

633
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:52,620
And that's just 100%,

634
00:28:52,724 --> 00:28:54,344
nail in the coffin,
I'm voting for James.

635
00:28:54,448 --> 00:28:55,724
James has, like,

636
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,931
just got a major advantage
in the water well.

637
00:28:58,034 --> 00:28:59,827
- Supposedly.
- Uh-huh.

638
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:01,965
Supposedly,
James found something.

639
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:03,689
What do you mean,
he found something?

640
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:05,758
I heard James got some kind of
an idol down at the water well.

641
00:29:05,862 --> 00:29:07,103
Oh, really?

642
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:08,896
I guess it was
in the water well.

643
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,172
- And then...
- Mm.

644
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:11,827
I think James is the one
that saw it first.

645
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:14,724
They found it in the water well,
and I think James got it.

646
00:29:14,827 --> 00:29:16,000
So...

647
00:29:16,103 --> 00:29:17,206
- Okay.
- Yeah.

648
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,000
- So then five on James?
- Yeah.

649
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:22,137
<i>Right now
there's the easy route.</i>

650
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:24,206
<i>I could go
with the Vesi-Baka alliance,</i>

651
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,241
<i>and we can, you know,
split the votes between</i>

652
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:28,586
<i>James and Ryan,
and we could take out James.</i>

653
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:31,655
That's the route that Noelle
has sort of charted for us.

654
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:33,172
What are you hearing?

655
00:29:33,275 --> 00:29:36,000
I have a feeling that Noelle
is calling the shots.

656
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:38,551
<i>I go to Karla.
I genuinely trust Karla</i>

657
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:40,344
<i>more than I trust Noelle
right now. Like...</i>

658
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:42,482
We have, like,
so many similar experiences,

659
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:44,896
<i>and she reminds me
so much of my family.</i>

660
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,310
If we don't
get Noelle by surprise,

661
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:48,310
we're gonna be dead.

662
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,655
This could blow my game,

663
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:51,344
because I've been, like,
with Vesi, but, like,

664
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:53,310
- we have
to figure out something.
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

665
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:54,758
-'Cause you're seeing
the same thing I'm seeing.
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

666
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,379
<i>You can sit here in this game</i>

667
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:58,137
<i>and you can watch somebody like
Noelle accumulate this power</i>

668
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,344
<i>and, like, be like,
"Oh, you know what?</i>

669
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:00,793
<i>"Now is not the right time.</i>

670
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:02,482
<i>I'll try and, like,
weaken her eventually."</i>

671
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:03,827
Or you can make a move now.

672
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:08,551
She's gaming.

673
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:10,000
She's gaming so hard.

674
00:30:10,103 --> 00:30:11,758
<i>And so, I go to Cody,
and I'm asking him</i>

675
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,068
what his thoughts are.

676
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:14,931
I've never been
a huge fan of Dwight's.

677
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:19,034
- He's always kind of
been kind of eerie to me.
- Mm-hmm.

678
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:22,241
<i>He thinks, instead of Noelle,
we should go after Dwight.</i>

679
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:24,344
- Dwight's also
very good at this game.
- Yeah.

680
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,931
He's done the puzzles.
He's done all kinds of good ...

681
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,620
<i>That's not
personally what I want,</i>

682
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:30,206
<i>but if I'm able
to take out Dwight</i>

683
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,068
<i>and weaken Noelle,
that's fine with me.</i>

684
00:30:33,172 --> 00:30:35,655
And it also gives Cody,
like, a sense of agency, right?

685
00:30:35,758 --> 00:30:36,862
Like, you don't want
to strip people

686
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,034
of their agency in this game.

687
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,448
It's gonna be a tough one.

688
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,206
Yeah.

689
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,793
We're exploring the option
of making a move already now

690
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:48,586
<i>and joining with Coco
against Dwight and Noelle.</i>

691
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,172
But Noelle...

692
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:56,034
<i>This is a move
that's going to really</i>

693
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:57,517
<i>make things a little crazy.</i>

694
00:30:58,551 --> 00:30:59,413
Is it too soon?

695
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:00,724
It could be,

696
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:02,206
<i>but no matter what,</i>

697
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,827
<i>Jesse and I are gonna
be on the same page.</i>

698
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:23,068
I have the Knowledge Is Power Advantage,

699
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,172
meaning that I can
take someone's idol or advantage

700
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:26,482
if I know who they are

701
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,827
right before
the votes at Tribal Council.

702
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:30,965
Ooh.

703
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,413
<i>Right now I'm glad
I have something in my pocket,</i>

704
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,137
but it's the most nervous
I've been in the game.

705
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:40,137
<i>This is tricky just because,
once I take someone's idol,</i>

706
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:43,517
if I'm successful,
I have a huge target on my back.

707
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,275
Then, if I'm wrong,
I'm definitely going home.

708
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:48,689
I got Geo's
Knowledge Is Power right now.

709
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:53,482
<i>But using the Knowledge Is
Power to gain trust is very key.</i>

710
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:55,586
- I do have Knowledge Is Power.
- Okay.

711
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:57,275
<i>This Knowledge
Is Power Advantage</i>

712
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:59,965
<i>is something that I can use
to say, "Hey, I have this.</i>

713
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:01,344
<i>Let's work together."</i>

714
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:03,172
I trust you, and...

715
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:05,172
Yeah.

716
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:06,448
Knowledge Is Power.

717
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:07,758
- So...
- Knowledge Is Power, you can...

718
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:09,344
- Take an idol.
- Really?

719
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:11,034
Yes.

720
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,344
<i>Oh, crap.
James has a Knowledge Is Power.</i>

721
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:16,034
<i>I still have
my immunity bracelet.</i>

722
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:18,137
<i>I know James knows I have it.</i>

723
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:19,793
<i>It may be time to vote him out.</i>

724
00:32:20,827 --> 00:32:24,620
<i>Because now he is the most
dangerous player out here.</i>

725
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:26,068
<i>So, if for some reason</i>

726
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:28,034
<i>he would take
my immunity bracelet tonight...</i>

727
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:32,379
<i>...I've given it
to Jesse because</i>

728
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:34,724
<i>I feel it's safer with him
than with me at this time.</i>

729
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:36,862
We don't know what it is,

730
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:38,275
but it could be
another merge advantage,

731
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:39,655
- like we've seen
the past two seasons.
- Yeah.

732
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,172
It's probably
Knowledge Is Power, so...

733
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:44,344
- We're just... Yeah.
- We're trying to, like,
transfer everything around

734
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:46,068
to make sure James
will never guess who has what.

735
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,068
- Yeah. Yeah.
<i>- We don't know
what the advantage is,</i>

736
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:49,689
<i>so we're really
preparing for it to be anything.</i>

737
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:52,310
But, in the event
that it's Knowledge Is Power,

738
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:54,551
we already have a plan
set in place where,

739
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:55,827
<i>to cover our butts,</i>

740
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:58,137
we will do cross-tribe switches.

741
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:01,896
<i>It feels scary
to hand over my idol</i>

742
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,034
when that is the one piece
of power I have right now.

743
00:33:05,137 --> 00:33:07,068
- Okay.
- Of course, you know, I'll
give it right back to you...

744
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:09,482
Oh, no, of course. No, yeah,
of course. I trust you.

745
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:11,793
<i>But I think my idol
is safer in Dwight's hands</i>

746
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:13,551
than it is in mine.

747
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:19,896
Yeah. Yeah.

748
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,275
Just in case
James decides to ask me

749
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,034
do I have
an idol or advantage...

750
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:27,275
Ooh. I like that.

751
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:30,896
...we decide that I'm gonna
give my advantage to Owen.

752
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,275
This is gonna be super quick.

753
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:33,827
- Yeah. Dwight filled me in.
- Yeah, perfect.

754
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:35,448
- Genius. All right.
Piece of cake.
- Thank you.

755
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:38,241
<i>Noelle gave me
her Steal a Vote in case</i>

756
00:33:38,344 --> 00:33:40,137
<i>James had found
Knowledge Is Power.</i>

757
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:42,172
<i>So we played
a little musical chairs,</i>

758
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:45,034
<i>a little shell game,
to try to cover it up.</i>

759
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:46,931
<i>And then, on top of all that,</i>

760
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:49,172
<i>we're trying to, like,
figure out who to vote out.</i>

761
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:52,103
So there are a lot of things
that could go wrong tonight.

762
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:58,724
<i>There's so much that's
scary about tonight's vote.</i>

763
00:33:58,827 --> 00:34:00,482
<i>There's the easy route
where, you know,</i>

764
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:02,862
<i>I just stick with the plan,
and we take out James tonight.</i>

765
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:06,655
The more risky route is that
me and Cody flip our votes,

766
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:08,724
<i>and we take out Dwight tonight,</i>

767
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:10,206
<i>and we turn our back on Vesi,</i>

768
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,517
and it's officially
Vesi no more.

769
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:18,172
<i>In this game there's
this question of timing, right?</i>

770
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:21,103
<i>Like, you don't want to make
a big move too soon, but also,</i>

771
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:23,689
<i>like, you don't want
to play somebody else's game.</i>

772
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:25,241
<i>But now we're
in the stage of the game where,</i>

773
00:34:25,344 --> 00:34:27,000
<i>like, legends are made
or you flame out.</i>

774
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:30,689
<i>So, like, it's big. This is
the big league, so I'm ready.</i>

775
00:34:54,482 --> 00:34:55,551
All right.

776
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:58,655
So, today
the challenge was designed

777
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:01,655
to really illustrate
this idea of earning it

778
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:03,379
every single step of the way.

779
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:05,448
Karla, you've
been banged up a lot.

780
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:07,758
Did you feel
that was a representation

781
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:09,517
of how difficult it really is

782
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,827
just to survive
one day out here?

783
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:12,793
Uh, I mean, of course.

784
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:14,482
The first stage was the hardest,

785
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:16,103
and I feel like that was
our experience, at least for me,

786
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:18,137
- the first five days
were the hardest.
- Mm.

787
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,827
And then you get
to the second stage

788
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,758
and you're kind of like,
"I-I got the hang of this."

789
00:35:21,862 --> 00:35:23,413
But I could see then
the third stage was like,

790
00:35:23,517 --> 00:35:25,896
"Oh, no, you got to hold on,"
because you don't know

791
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,310
how long you have
until you're gone.

792
00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:31,310
So, Jesse, y'all get
back to camp. What happens?

793
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,724
I think we're at this, like,
different stage of the game.

794
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:34,931
Earlier stage of the game,

795
00:35:35,034 --> 00:35:36,275
we're going to Tribal
with six people.

796
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:37,793
It's, like,
almost like practice.

797
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:40,655
And now we're, like, in
the Colosseum, and we're like...

798
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:42,965
There were
definitely talks happening.

799
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:45,793
Dwight,
I have not heard any talk

800
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:48,413
about what I observed,
which was this sort of

801
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:50,620
Baka-Vesi versus Coco

802
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:53,103
or maybe helping each other.

803
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:55,724
It was talked about at one
of the challenges at the end.

804
00:35:55,827 --> 00:35:57,965
Did that just fall out
once you all got together?

805
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,034
Yeah, you know,
we all have the same color Buff.

806
00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:01,620
We're all representing ourselves
at this point in the game.

807
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:03,068
There's no more, like, indication

808
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:04,448
of Vesi, Baka, Coco here.

809
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:05,620
That was in the past.

810
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:06,586
Let's move forward
as individuals

811
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:08,137
and play our own games.

812
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:10,896
Noelle, what talk is there,
at this stage,

813
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,241
about advantages or idols
that could be in the game?

814
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:15,931
Going into Tribal Council,
if you're not thinking

815
00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:18,137
someone has something, then
it's probably you going home.

816
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:20,517
You have to always be on your
feet about that kind of stuff.

817
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,103
You don't want someone
going home on your alliance

818
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:25,068
because someone else
played an idol or an advantage.

819
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:26,965
You have to have plan A,

820
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:30,000
plan B, plan C
and plan D, just in case.

821
00:36:30,103 --> 00:36:32,931
So, James,
this idea of plan A, plan B,

822
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:34,655
plan C, plan D,

823
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:36,482
does that go through
your head all the time?

824
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:39,413
I mean, you still have
to weigh each relationship

825
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:42,068
with what they're saying,
and does the actual actions,

826
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:45,655
uh, back up
what's being said at Tribal?

827
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:48,689
So advantages are great.
Idols are great.

828
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:51,000
At the same time, you have
to know when to use them.

829
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:52,965
You have to know,
if you have an idol,

830
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:54,000
know if you're in trouble.

831
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:55,137
To use certain advantages,

832
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:56,448
you have to have
certain knowledge.

833
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,275
So a lot of people
have played advantages

834
00:36:58,379 --> 00:36:59,620
wrong and to their detriment.

835
00:36:59,724 --> 00:37:01,482
So you can't sit back
and just be worried

836
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,310
about advantages 24/7.

837
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:04,689
You can drive yourself crazy.

838
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:08,068
What you can do
is find a group of people

839
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,482
that you build trust with,
that give you a logical plan,

840
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:11,827
and you kind of stick to it.

841
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:14,620
Cody, give us a surfing analogy.

842
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:17,103
You're gonna go
surfing for the day.

843
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:18,310
Where are we right now?

844
00:37:18,413 --> 00:37:19,862
At this point,

845
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:21,793
we're trying to decide
if we're gonna go in the water,

846
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:23,241
or if we're just gonna stay
on the beach with the girls

847
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:25,827
and the beers
and the umbrellas hanging out.

848
00:37:25,931 --> 00:37:28,931
You know, it's that decision
of, are you gonna jump in

849
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:31,413
and play this game
and really go for it?

850
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:32,896
Or maybe just hang out
a little bit longer

851
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,551
and, uh, let it come to you.

852
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:37,517
So it's a little bit like <i>Jaws.</i>

853
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,586
You know
there's a shark somewhere.

854
00:37:42,758 --> 00:37:44,103
But we haven't seen it yet.

855
00:37:44,206 --> 00:37:45,551
Yeah.

856
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:47,551
Jesse, how confident are you

857
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,310
that you're
going to be okay tonight?

858
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:52,000
Are we doing this on a scale
of one to ten again?

859
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,793
That was super funny.

860
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:57,724
Just generally speaking,
how confident are you

861
00:37:57,827 --> 00:37:59,758
the vote
will go your way tonight?

862
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:03,344
I am sitting at a nine today.

863
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,896
- Karla?
- I'd say nine.

864
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,448
Ryan, how confident are you?

865
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,689
I would say seven, eight.

866
00:38:09,793 --> 00:38:11,000
All right. Cody?

867
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:12,586
- Eight.
- How about you, James?

868
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:13,758
8.5.

869
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:15,137
How about you, Dwight?

870
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,965
- Seven.
- How about you, Noelle?

871
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:18,965
- Eight.
- This is crazy, right?

872
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:21,620
We have a bunch of people who
are all very close to saying,

873
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:23,103
"Pretty sure I'm good to go,"

874
00:38:23,206 --> 00:38:24,310
and yet one of you is
about to get your torch snuffed.

875
00:38:24,413 --> 00:38:25,931
I'll be the voice of reason.

876
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:27,344
I'm terrified.

877
00:38:27,448 --> 00:38:28,689
I don't know
what's gonna happen,

878
00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:30,068
but at the end of the day

879
00:38:30,172 --> 00:38:31,620
you got to play this game

880
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:33,620
not with your heart,
not with your mind.

881
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:34,862
You got to go with your gut.

882
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:36,586
If your gut's wrong,
your gut's wrong,

883
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,586
but you only get to come
out here and do this one time.

884
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:42,034
And so, if you act like you
have anything other than that,

885
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:44,137
you're not gonna play the game
the way that you ever wanted to.

886
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,172
Wow. Well said.

887
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,517
All right, it is time to vote.

888
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,517
Noelle, you're up.

889
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:43,172
If anybody has
an advantage or an idol

890
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:45,965
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

891
00:39:55,068 --> 00:39:57,241
All right, I'll read the votes.

892
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:03,103
First vote, James.

893
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:08,793
Dwight. One vote James,
one vote Dwight.

894
00:40:12,137 --> 00:40:13,482
Ryan.

895
00:40:13,586 --> 00:40:16,172
One vote James,
one vote Dwight, one vote Ryan.

896
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:19,241
James.

897
00:40:19,344 --> 00:40:20,896
That's two votes James.

898
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:25,068
Dwight. We're tied again.
Two votes James,

899
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,724
two votes Dwight,
one vote Ryan.

900
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:29,137
Ryan.

901
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:32,448
That's two votes James,
two votes Dwight,

902
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:34,137
two votes Ryan.

903
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:35,758
Ryan.

904
00:40:35,862 --> 00:40:39,137
That's three votes Ryan, two
votes James, two votes Dwight.

905
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,931
Dwight. We're tied again.

906
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:50,896
Three votes Ryan, three
votes Dwight, two votes James.

907
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:53,724
Dwight.

908
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:54,965
That's four votes Dwight,

909
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:57,862
three votes Ryan,
two votes James.

910
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,379
Dwight.

911
00:41:00,482 --> 00:41:01,724
That's five votes Dwight,

912
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,000
three votes Ryan,
two votes James.

913
00:41:07,413 --> 00:41:11,310
Seventh person voted out
of <i>Survivor 43...</i> Dwight.

914
00:41:11,413 --> 00:41:12,965
- Yeah.
- That's six. That's enough.

915
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:14,586
You need to bring me your torch.

916
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:22,931
Good game, you guys.

917
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:24,586
- Good game, Dwight.
- Love you all.

918
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:30,517
Dwight, the tribe has spoken.

919
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:34,034
Glad to hear that.

920
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:35,172
- Time for you to go.
- Thank you, guys.

921
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:36,448
- Bye, Dwight.
- Have a good one.

922
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:37,827
Be safe, man.

923
00:41:43,827 --> 00:41:46,137
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

924
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:47,862
Good night.

<i>that skip to our Lou
to the end of the game.</i>

929
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:12,034
That's not
the way the game should go.

930
00:42:12,137 --> 00:42:13,862
We can start an uprising.

931
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:17,172
- Yeah.
<i>- Sometimes
you have to rock the boat.</i>

932
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:19,344
People were running around
like Jean-Claude Van Damme.

933
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:22,034
<i>I'm trying to set myself up
to win this game.</i>

934

<i>Uh, well, I just
got blindsided pretty hard.</i>

936
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:30,827
<i>that means two people
on Vesi flipped on me.</i>

<i>Don't know who they are,</i>

938
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:33,448

<i>It's a lot of emotions

940
00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:36,310

literally a day away</i>

941
00:42:36,413 --> 00:42:37,724
<i>from making the jury.
That sucks.</i>

942
00:42:37,827 --> 00:42:39,344
<i>At the same time,
I can't be disappointed</i>

943
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:40,793

945
