00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:19,862
<i>
This group of strangers</i>

2
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:23,275
<i>has agreed to be abandoned
in the Fijian islands.</i>

3
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:27,517
<i>They come from
different backgrounds...</i>

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,103
I was born three months early
with mild cerebral palsy.

5
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:32,206
<i>The doctor said,
"You know, he's not gonna walk.</i>

6
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,551
<i>He's gonna be in a wheelchair."</i>

7
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:35,379
<i>
...cultures...</i>

8
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,896
<i>
Growing up in Nigeria
was like</i> Survivor.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,344
You know, it was like
survival of the fittest.

10
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,241
<i>
...and experiences.</i>

11
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:43,862
<i>
I played Division I lacrosse.</i>

12
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:45,655
<i>I was in a moped accident
that caused me</i>

13
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:47,689
<i>to lose my left leg
above the knee.</i>

14
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:49,793
<i>And then I became a Paralympian.</i>

15
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:52,689
And I hold the United States
record for the 100-meter.

16
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:55,413
<i>
But despite their differences,</i>

17
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:58,758
<i>they must rely on each other
in order to survive.</i>

18
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:03,137
<i>
My biggest asset as a teacher
is being able to connect.</i>

19
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,241
<i>I always hear people get
on this show, and they say,</i>

20
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:06,689
"I'm not here
to make any friends."

21
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,448
And I'm like, "Well, I am."

22
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:09,965
<i>Be my friend.</i>

23
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:12,310
<i>Let's have an authentic
and genuine connection and bond.</i>

24
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:14,000
That way, when I get to the end,
you can vote me the million.

25
00:01:14,103 --> 00:01:15,655
And then we can go out
for pizza and coffee afterwards.

26
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:24,103
<i>
Being 19 and as young as I am,
I am way more than just my age.</i>

27
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:26,862
I'm actually attending Brigham
Young University right now.

28
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:29,620
So, I'm, like,
a student, pet cremator,

29
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,551
business owner hybrid.
I'm all this.

30
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:33,344
I'm all these things.
Like, look at me.

31
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:36,379
<i>I think I'm just
a fun and "energible"--</i>

32
00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:38,310
I don't know if that's a word--
"energible" person.

33
00:01:38,413 --> 00:01:40,482
<i>And I don't think I cater
to one specific group.</i>

34
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:41,793
<i>I can cater to anybody.</i>

35
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:51,103
<i>
I am unapologetically</i>
Survivor's <i>biggest fan.</i>

36
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:52,310
<i>I mean, I've loved</i> Survivor

37
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,551
longer than I've known
my husband,

38
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:56,931
<i>my kids, my nursing career.</i>

39
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,379
<i>I've spent the last 22 years
imagining this moment.</i>

40
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:03,413
It's finally here.
I get one shot at it.

41
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:05,206
What am I gonna do with it?

42
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:12,689
<i>
Growing up
in a tough environment,</i>

43
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:16,000
<i>I'm a very adaptable
and a very resilient person.</i>

44
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,551
That's how I've gotten
to where I am today in life.

45
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:21,241
<i>When I've been tired,
when I've been beaten down,</i>

46
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:24,034
<i>when I've been told no,
that's my time to shine</i>

47
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:26,517
and kick ass.

48
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:35,137
I'm gonna play the game
as hard and as fast as I can--

49
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:36,379
just like I do my life.

50
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:38,551
<i>Just like the way I surf.</i>

51
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:40,551
<i>Just like the way
I go out on a weekend.</i>

52
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:43,241
And I'll be honest with you,
I've already spent part of it.

53
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:45,344
So I really need,
I really need the million bucks.

54
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,103
<i>
They'll form a new society</i>

55
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,586
<i>where they decide the rules</i>

56
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:57,275
<i>of how this
million-dollar game is played.</i>

57
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,172
<i>I'm not gonna
sit around and wait</i>

58
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:00,896
for other people
to determine my game.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,517
<i>I make my fate. I make my game.</i>

60
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:07,758
<i>
It's up to them
who stays and who goes.</i>

61
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:09,551
One thing I do as a psychologist

62
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,931
<i>is get people to do things
that they don't want to do.</i>

63
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:15,241
<i>They'll figure it out once
their torch is getting snuffed.</i>

64
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:18,413
<i>
Each player must learn</i>

65
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:20,068
<i>to adapt to their new society,</i>

66
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:21,551
<i>or they'll be voted out.</i>

67
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,793
I want the game to be chaotic.

68
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:25,551
<i>I want no one to know
what's going on.</i>

69
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:27,310
For me, that's my comfort zone.

70
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:29,517
<i>
In the end,
only one will remain</i>

71
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,137
<i>to claim
the million-dollar prize.</i>

72
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:33,689
I want this so bad.

73
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:36,482
<i>I used to daydream
about seeing my name up</i>

74
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:38,206
<i>in the opening credits.</i>

75
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,862
<i>
I'm buckled up
and I'm ready for the ride.</i>

76
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:44,000
<i>
Let's do this.</i>

77
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:45,517
Who will have what it takes

78
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,793
to outwit, outplay
and outlast all the rest?

79
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,862
This is <i>Survivor 43.</i>

80
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,206
Come on up.

81
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:16,413
<i>
When you pull up
and you see Jeff standing there,</i>

82
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,655
<i>it's just the most surreal
thing that you can imagine.</i>

83
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,275
<i>I honestly felt like</i>

84
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:22,241
kind of out-of-body experience.

85
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:24,241
<i>And I'm like,
"Whoa. Shoot. I'm here."</i>

86
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:26,344
<i>Like, I am a part of it, and</i>

87
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:27,482
it's intense.

88
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:30,931
All right.

89
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:34,620
- Welcome to <i>Survivor 43.</i>

90
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:39,275
It's here.

91
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,448
- Oh!
- Yes.

92
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:41,448
I can feel the energy.

93
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,724
Woman in the front right
in the yellow dress.

94
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,000
- Yeah.
-<i>♪ Hi!♪</i>

95
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:48,655
- What's your name?
- My name is Jeanine.

96
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:50,931
Okay, explain that reaction,
that <i>♪ Hi!♪</i>

97
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,793
-'Cause, you... It's...
- Yeah. Sorry.

98
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:54,655
This has been...
Honestly, I just...

99
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,068
I can't even believe I'm here,

100
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,586
and this has been a dream
for not only my lifetime

101
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,827
but my father's,
and so it's-it's just

102
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:02,413
a dream
of two lifetimes, really.

103
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:04,344
What's the connection
with your dad and <i>Survivor?</i>

104
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:07,827
This was his first
favorite American TV show

105
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:09,586
when he immigrated
from China, so,

106
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,931
he used to be a sweet potato
farmer back in China,

107
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:14,482
and to now be
a biology professor

108
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:15,965
- with his PhD here...
- Wow.

109
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:17,413
and having a daughter be
on the show

110
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,551
is just beyond all
of our wildest dreams.

111
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:22,793
Guy in the back, in the
blue shirt-- what's your name?

112
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:25,137
- Oh, James.
- James, how about you?

113
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,517
When'd you find <i>Survivor?</i>

114
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,275
When Richard Hatch
was sitting on the tree.

115
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,896
- Day one.
- Day one.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,034
I remember Earl winning,

117
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:33,379
<i>uh, his season.</i>

118
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:35,758
<i>For me, it was just good
to see that...</i>

119
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:37,896
<i>You know, I'm from Philadelphia,
and to see somebody that</i>

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,068
looked like me, similar
background, go to an island,

121
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:42,344
live on dirt, and come out
and win a million dollars--

122
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:44,137
it just got me excited
about the game,

123
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:46,448
and I've kind of been
watching ever since, so...

124
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:48,103
Guy in the back right
with the beanie?

125
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:50,206
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name?

126
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,206
- Gabler. Mike Gabler.
- Gabler.

127
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,586
When did you discover <i>Survivor?</i>

128
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:55,724
Jeff, I've been watching
since the very beginning

129
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:58,827
when our children
were still being created.

130
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:00,448
And my wife, basically,
when they hatched--

131
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:03,206
we-we started watching as a
family like everybody else did,

132
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,413
and we make it a <i>Survivor</i> night
every week.

133
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:08,310
- I'm proud to be here.
- Glad to have you here.

134
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:09,758
Woman in the middle--
what's your name?

135
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:11,310
- Noelle.
- Noelle,

136
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,586
when did you first
start watching <i>Survivor?</i>

137
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:14,965
I first started
watching <i>Survivor</i>

138
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,310
probably
when I was about ten years old.

139
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:18,000
My mom loved this show,
but she said

140
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:19,137
she could never play it.

141
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:21,241
So I said, "You know what?

142
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:23,379
I'll apply
and I'll play for both of us."

143
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:24,827
And then I lost my leg, Jeff.

144
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:27,206
- And then, hey.
- You lost it after you applied?

145
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,931
Yeah, I lost my leg
when I was 19 years old,

146
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,758
and losing my leg is
the best thing

147
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:33,517
that's ever happened
to me, you know?

148
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,482
It made me realize
the importance in life.

149
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:38,275
Having something
like this happen to you--

150
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:39,620
it just really made me think,
"You know what?

151
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:41,103
This is... it's just a leg."

152
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,724
And I don't want to look back
and regret my life.

153
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:45,620
I want to look back
and be proud of it.

154
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:50,172
And the beautiful game of <i>
Survivor</i> and how it has evolved

155
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,896
is the reason why
I even wanted to keep showing up

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,620
and keep applying and try
to get on the show, because

157
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:58,655
it's almost accepted
and encouraged to be different.

158
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:02,896
And I'm just grateful to be here
and to be able to prove myself

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,206
and show
that amputees are badasses.

160
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,275
You know, I got a few
leg jokes along the way,

161
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:11,103
- so I hope I can tell you guys.

162
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:13,137
All right, so I've heard a lot.

163
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:16,862
Let me see if I can encapsulate
what we've just talked about.

164
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:20,068
<i>Survivor</i> is a lot of things.

165
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,275
First and foremost, it's a game.

166
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,448
It's a great game,
and one of the things

167
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,379
that makes it so great is,
anybody can play

168
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:29,275
because there really
aren't many rules.

169
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:32,413
<i>You form a community
with a bunch of strangers</i>

170
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:36,000
<i>where you decide
how that society will function.</i>

171
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:37,620
<i>You decide
how the game will be played--</i>

172
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:41,206
<i>slow, fast, safe, dangerous.</i>

173
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,103
<i>You are forced to rely
on each other</i>

174
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:46,689
<i>to live in a jungle
on an island</i>

175
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:50,482
<i>while simultaneously voting
each other off the island</i>

176
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:52,724
<i>in pursuit of a million dollars.</i>

177
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:57,206
Pretty tremendous. But <i>
Survivor</i> is also an adventure.

178
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,896
All of you got up off the couch,

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,793
applied
because you want that adventure.

180
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:05,965
You want to leave that normal
life behind for a moment,

181
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,689
fly across the world
to be tested

182
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:09,482
in ways you can't imagine.

183
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:11,379
It's terrifying,

184
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:12,689
and yet you're all smiling.

185
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:16,586
- Because it's also exhilarating.

186
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,620
So if you can just let go

187
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:23,586
of expectation and instead
give yourself permission

188
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:25,689
to play,
you can change your life.

189
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:27,551
You can change
how you see yourself,

190
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:29,724
you can change how you see
the world, you can change

191
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:33,172
how others see you, because
being here takes courage.

192
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:35,103
I'm glad each of you are here.

193
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:37,793
I hope <i>Survivor</i> gives you
what you seek,

194
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,827
and I also hope
you'll stay open

195
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:43,000
to receiving
what <i>Survivor</i> thinks you need.

196
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:44,379
Shall we get into it?

197
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,655
All right.

198
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:51,689
Tribe names.
Wearing red, you are Vesi.

199
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:53,482
- Yeah.

200
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:55,965
In the middle, in yellow-- Baka.

201
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,655
- Baka!

202
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:02,551
And on the end, in blue-- Coco.

203
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,310
All right, I'm gonna give the
ten points to yellow. I think

204
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,965
- that was the most tribe spirit.

205
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:11,896
All right, you ready to get
to your first reward challenge?

206
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,034
- Wow.
- Here we go.

207
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,275
Two players are going
to race down the beach,

208
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:23,241
<i>retrieve and bring back...
two heavy wooden crates.</i>

209
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:25,758
<i>Then two other players are going
to run out into the water,</i>

210
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:28,482
<i>haul a boat back
carrying more crates.</i>

211
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:30,379
<i>Once you get
all the crates here,</i>

212
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:34,448
<i>the two remaining players will
use those crates to form a cube.</i>

213
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:39,137
<i>Then one player will
hop up on top,</i>

214
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:42,137
<i>use a bamboo pole
to retrieve a flint.</i>

215
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:46,344
<i>First tribe to get their flint</i>

216
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:47,965
earns their camp supplies.

217
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,965
It's not much.

218
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:53,689
A pot, a machete and the flint.

219
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,689
- No food, no help.

220
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:59,896
You're gonna earn it
every single day out here.

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,379
Two losing tribes--
you will have to go to your camp

222
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:05,689
and try again to earn it
in another way. Big setback.

223
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:07,137
You're not building shelter.

224
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,620
You're just trying
to get your tribe supplies.

225
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,620
All right, I'm gonna give you
just a moment

226
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:12,862
to figure out
who's going to do what.

227
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,310
Okay. All right, guys, come in.

228
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:16,931
- Get in here.
- All right, so who's running...?

229
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:21,310
You want to run?
Me and you are running?

230
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,586
- All right, six.
Let's go.

231
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,551
Runners, come out here.
Here's our line right here.

232
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:29,310
This is official. Behind this.

233
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:30,827
Baka!

234
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,344
- Go, Vesi.
- Here we go, Vesi.

235
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:35,586
Let's go, Baka!

236
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:40,827
Here we go. First reward
challenge of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

237
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,862
Yes.

238
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:43,793
Survivors ready?

239
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:45,655
Go!

240
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:48,620
- You got to race
into the jungle.

241
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:50,965
Get two heavy wooden crates.

242
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,413
- Yeah, Vesi!

243
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,344
Doesn't matter
how you get 'em back.

244
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,931
You can help each other,
you can take your own.

245
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,758
You guys got this!

246
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,344
- Yes, Baka!

247
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:04,655
- Let's go!
- Who will emerge first?

248
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:09,620
Vesi, Baka or Coco?

249
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:18,103
- Wow.

250
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:21,482
That's Sami back for Baka.

251
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:24,137
Right behind, here comes Ryan,
here comes Cody.

252
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:27,068
- There's Jesse

253
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:29,344
- carrying one.
- Way to go, Jesse!

254
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:32,103
Geo struggling with his crate.

255
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:34,793
- Awesome! Good job, Sami!
- Yes! Yes!

256
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:37,137
Got to get 'em both back.

257
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:39,103
There's Owen with the second.
Takes a fall.

258
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:41,931
Here comes Jesse.
These are heavy.

259
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,551
Ryan now heading back to help
Geo, who's moving very slowly.

260
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:47,655
You've got it, Owen!

261
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:49,172
You're good.

262
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:51,034
You're good.

263
00:11:55,517 --> 00:11:56,689
It is Baka in the water.

264
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:58,862
Vesi now in the water.

265
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:00,275
- Let's go, Ryan!
- Here comes Ryan

266
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:04,379
with the second Coco crate.
Keep digging, Geo.

267
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,931
You're good! Let's go!

268
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:09,620
You got to get both people
to the boat.

269
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:13,482
You've got to unclip and then
pull your boat back to shore.

270
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:16,551
We've got Baka
still in the lead.

271
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,689
Elie and Gabler pushing hard.

272
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:20,068
Let's go, Baka!

273
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,586
Here comes Vesi.

274
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:25,344
Got Justine and Noelle.
Noelle at the back.

275
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:27,655
- Okay. Here we, here we go.
- Once you get it here,

276
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:29,379
- you got to clip it in.
- Go, Coco!

277
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,655
- Come on, girls!

278
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:36,517
There's Karla
and Cassidy for Coco.

279
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:40,241
Vesi now in the lead.
You're good.

280
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,310
- Let's go then.

281
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:43,862
Cassidy, let's go!

282
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:45,965
You're good!

283
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:49,344
Yo, you got this. Let's move it!

284
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:51,655
Cassidy and Karla,
you got to keep digging.

285
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:57,344
All right, Coco, you're good!

286
00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:59,793
- Coco, go!
- Let's go, baby.

287
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:04,896
Got Nneka and Dwight
on the puzzle for Vesi.

288
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,448
You've got Jeanine and Morriah
on the puzzle for Baka.

289
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:11,413
You're good, Coco.
Start working on that cube.

290
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,586
It's going
to be Lindsay and James.

291
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:18,103
You're using all of
these crates to solve the cube.

292
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:22,137
You are playing for a pot,
a machete and a flint,

293
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:25,793
which doesn't sound like much,
but out here it is everything.

294
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:27,482
- Oh, no, there, there!
- There! There! Put that one!

295
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:30,000
No. Here to there.

296
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,896
James and Lindsay
now with some excitement.

297
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,206
They think
they might have something.

298
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,068
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, baby!

299
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,482
James and Lindsay--
they've got it.

300
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,310
- Help her! Help her!
- Help her up! Help her up!

301
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:43,724
All right, you guys, come on.

302
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:45,206
- We got this, y'all.
- Coco has it.

303
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,137
- Come on! Come on!
- Lindsay is up now.

304
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:48,448
- Let's go, Lindsay.
- A little bit higher.
You got this.

305
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:49,689
Take your time. Take your time.

306
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,137
You got time. You got time.

307
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:52,344
It's Lindsay
with the bamboo pole

308
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:53,827
trying to retrieve the flint.

309
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:57,344
Vesi and Baka still working
to solve the cube.

310
00:13:57,448 --> 00:13:59,482
It would be an early victory
for the tribe

311
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:01,793
that was in dead last

312
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:03,586
with a big comeback

313
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,068
if Lindsay can
close it out here.

314
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:07,379
Can she get that ring?

315
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,413
Take your time! Take your time!

316
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,000
We're in the lead.
Don't rush it, baby.

317
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:13,206
- Come on. Hop up,
hop up, hop up.
- Vesi has it.

318
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,931
Now they're back in it.

319
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:18,310
Now it's Dwight for Vesi.
We've got two tribes in it.

320
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:19,758
- Come on!
- You got this.

321
00:14:19,862 --> 00:14:21,206
Dwight sees the opportunity.

322
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,517
- Okay, good job.
- Dwight.

323
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,172
- Dwight.
- You got this, Lindsay.
You got this.

324
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:26,965
He's got it good,
smooth, and it drops.

325
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:29,448
Here goes Lindsay.
She's got it halfway.

326
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:31,896
- No!
- Lindsay drops again.

327
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:38,206
Look at that.
Baka's back in it.

328
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,034
All three tribes are in it now.

329
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:43,241
- Come on, baby. You got it!
-
Once again why you never, ever

330
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:45,068
give up on yourself
in this game.

331
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,413
Hey, hey, Dwight.

332
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,137
Try to put the flint
right in the pole

333
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:49,620
on the top of the bamboo.

334
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,931
Go from underneath
and put the flint inside of it.

335
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:53,482
I got that.

336
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,241
Yeah, there's a hole
inside there.

337
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:58,827
Put the flint in there.

338
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,689
That's the one, baby.

339
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:02,206
There goes Dwight.

340
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,206
- Does he have it?
- That's the one.

341
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,551
- That's the one.
- Yes!

342
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,000
- He does!
- Yeah, baby!

343
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:11,931
Vesi wins first reward!

344
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:15,172
Tribe supplies waiting
back at camp.

345
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,551
Wow. What an opening challenge.

346
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:20,965
Everybody left it out
in the sand.

347
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:23,310
He put the flint
in the bamboo stick.

348
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:25,241
- It's all right.
- It...

349
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:31,517
All right. Great effort
by all three tribes.

350
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,689
Let me give you maps
to new homes.

351
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:37,862
- Welcome to <i>Survivor.</i>
- Yeah!

352
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:39,896
- Yeah.
- Go, Coco!

353
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,413
All right, Vesi, great job.

354
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:44,620
Your tribe supplies will
be waiting for you back at camp.

355
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:48,034
Like I said, it's not much,
but it's a lot in this game.

356
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:50,206
One pot, one machete, one flint.

357
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,172
Baka, Coco, you're going
to go to your new camp

358
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,724
and have to try to earn it
in another way,

359
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:58,379
which will take time away
from building shelter.

360
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:00,586
That's the penalty for losing.

361
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:03,310
- Vesi, head out to your boat.

362
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,103
- Good luck.
- All right.

363
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:07,724
Baka, Coco, head out.

364
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:09,793
- Thank you, Jeff.
- Thank you, Jeff.

365
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:11,448
<i>
Out of the gates, to fail</i>

366
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,827
<i>at something that I thought
I would be so good at</i>

367
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,517
is a huge wake-up call to me.

368
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,206
And it made me realize
that, like,

369
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,862
<i>being out here
and the challenges</i>

370
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,793
<i>that we're about to face
are going to be a hell</i>

371
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,413
<i>of a lot harder
than I thought they would be.</i>

372
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:25,758
<i>And it has definitely set in
that we need to be ready</i>

373
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:27,862
<i>for anything that Jeff's
about to put out there.</i>

374
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:45,793
Yay.

375
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:48,931
- Yes. This is home.
- This is home.

376
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,793
<i>
Winning the first challenge
sets a tone,</i>

377
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,724
<i>from an excitement level,
from a camaraderie level.</i>

378
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:56,241
I feel alive from my-my...
my toes to my bones

379
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:58,068
to my heart to my spirit.

380
00:16:58,172 --> 00:16:59,931
Vesi.

381
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:03,827
- Yee-hoo! Yeah!

382
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:06,241
Hell, yeah!
We got a machete, a pot.

383
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:07,931
We're ready to rock.

384
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:10,931
<i>During the pandemic, I started
binge-watching</i> Survivor,

385
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:13,551
and I realized
that I have the tools

386
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:17,517
to... not only to compete
but... but to win <i>Survivor.</i>

387
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,827
You guys wants to, uh, chat
and talk story for a second?

388
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:22,482
See what everybody does.
Maybe we got someone in here

389
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:24,482
that does construction
or knows how to build a shelter.

390
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,931
- Right? Okay, okay, okay.
Good play.
- Not me.

391
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:30,482
I am so blessed to just get
out there and do some living.

392
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:33,068
L-I-V-I-N. You know, get busy
living and get busy dying.

393
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:34,620
That's how I'm going
to play this game.

394
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,482
So I'm... I'm locked and loaded,
ready to go full throttle,

395
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:39,620
ride a wheelie
all the way across the park.

396
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:42,241
Uh, my name's Cody. I'm 35,

397
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:43,931
and I work for an elevator
and escalator company.

398
00:17:44,034 --> 00:17:46,103
My name is Nneka.
Nneka's a Nigerian name.

399
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:47,862
- That's where
I'm from originally.
- Amazing.

400
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:49,689
I think it's a name you give

401
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:52,068
when you want a boy
and get a girl.

402
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,275
So was mine. Mine is a boy name
with an "E" at the end.

403
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:55,758
So...

404
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:57,413
- Yeah.
- Justine?

405
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,275
- I get called "Justin"
all the time.

406
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,689
Oh, and I work
in software sales.

407
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:01,793
Okay. Cool.

408
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:03,275
I'm Dwight. I'm 21.

409
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:05,172
- So my graduation
is a few weeks...
- Yeah.

410
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:07,034
- after I'm done here. Like...
- Oh, my God. That's...

411
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:09,275
<i>
My family and I have watched</i>
Survivor <i>together since</i>

412
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,034
<i>I was about six years old.
We've watched</i>

413
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:13,379
<i>every single season
since then.</i>

414
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:14,862
<i>So my game plan
hitting the beach is,</i>

415
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:16,275
okay, let's go build
the shelter,

416
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:17,896
let's go start doing
all the <i>Survivor</i> things.

417
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:20,862
We can definitely cut the...
I think... I think...

418
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,413
- We have a machete, guys.
- Oh, yeah.

419
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:24,103
<i>
And we quickly realized</i>

420
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:25,931
no one has any idea
what they're doing

421
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,310
when it comes
to shelter construction.

422
00:18:27,413 --> 00:18:28,931
Has anyone used
a machete before?

423
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:30,724
- No.
- No.

424
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:33,517
I can try it out if y'all
really don't want to do it.

425
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,551
I...

426
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:37,103
Be careful.

427
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:38,620
Yeah.

428
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,896
- Right?

429
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,896
Pull it. Pull it over.

430
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,206
- Like this?
- Yeah.

431
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,482
<i>
I know my parents are going</i>

432
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:47,206
<i>to not let me hear the end of it</i>

433
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,241
<i>because before we left,
they said,</i>

434
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,241
<i>"You need to learn how to build
a shelter properly." Like,</i>

435
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:53,517
"I watched videos. I know how
to build one. It'll be fine."

436
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,862
- Does it move if you let it go?
- It's slipping down.

437
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,137
Got to... got to deal
with that when I get home.

438
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:14,620
<i>We've got a beautiful
group of people on this tribe,</i>

439
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:16,068
a very positive tribe.

440
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:21,241
<i>We've got some strong people,
we've got</i>

441
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:22,586
<i>a lot of personality.</i>

442
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:24,206
<i>But being older,</i>

443
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,551
I am on the outside.

444
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:26,931
<i>I'm the oldest guy out here.</i>

445
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:30,931
<i>I think I'm 20 to 30 years older</i>

446
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:32,344
than some of my teammates.

447
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:34,862
- Yeah. We got this.
- Wait.

448
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,724
<i>
So I have to be careful</i>

449
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:39,241
<i>with how I start my game plan.</i>

00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,655
Oh, gosh.

451
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:04,586
"Two tribe members
work together..."

452
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,000
Huh.

453
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,931
- Okay.
- All righty.

00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:35,448

"Shh. Like, stop with that."

457
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:43,103

<i>going to do it with you."</i>

459
00:20:44,586 --> 00:20:45,965
<i>And I was not going to do that.</i>

460
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:47,482
A] the physical exertion,

461
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:48,931
B] being away from everyone
in those first moments.

462
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:51,206
<i>That's where
all the scheming, plotting,</i>

463
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,137
<i>strategizing happen, and
that's where lines get drawn.</i>

464
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:55,862
- I feel like we all
busted our ass so much...
- Yeah.

465
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:57,482
- I feel like we should
all do it together.
- That sounds...

466
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:58,689
- That's...
- Let's use our brains.
We're a smart group.

467
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:00,034
And we win together,
we lose together.

468
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:04,620
Baka.

469
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:07,344
- All right.
- Okay, let's...

470
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,068
We have four hours.

471
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:22,344
Um, can we see the clue
one more time?

472
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:26,620
"Move two bones to form
the largest whole number."

473
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:33,965
"You can only move
the two bones one time."

474
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,206
<i>
We clearly have</i>

475
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,413
an intelligent tribe,

476
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:38,448
<i>but our minds are all racing,</i>

477
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:41,103
<i>and it's hard
to know what to focus on.</i>

478
00:21:41,206 --> 00:21:42,344
Can that still be a nine?

479
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:43,655
I don't think that's gonna fly.

480
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:44,862
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

481
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:46,413
<i>
Right now, we absolutely</i>

482
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:47,931
<i>are up the creek</i>

483
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:49,172
without a paddle.

484
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,862
So, we have
four hours to complete

485
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,931
whatever that
dig-out challenge is.

486
00:21:58,034 --> 00:22:00,379
So I'm willing to dig if
somebody else is willing to dig.

487
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:04,931
<i>
Four hours
to dig on the beach?</i>

488
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:07,551
I didn't come out here
to be a strong person.

489
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:09,931
That was not
what I came out here to be.

490
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:11,965
Yeah, is that for sure
what every...

491
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:13,482
- I mean...
- Is that okay
with everyone?

492
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:15,310
I mean, yeah,
as long as it's okay with y'all.

493
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:18,310
<i>
So our choice was
Sweat versus Savvy.</i>

494
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:20,551
<i>We just looked at each other,
and we're like, "Okay,</i>

495
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,103
"none of us are,
like, geniuses here.

496
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:24,620
: So we just got to...
Let's be real."

497
00:22:24,724 --> 00:22:27,344
<i>For the Sweat challenge,
you have to dig</i>

498
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:31,310
<i>for your supplies, and it
could be anywhere in the square.</i>

499
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:36,275
<i>I volunteered, 'cause I felt
a little guilty about</i>

500
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:38,103
<i>not being able
to carry the boxes</i>

501
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:40,586
from the previous challenge.

502
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:41,793
- See you guys later.
- Good job, guys.

503
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:43,241
It'll be quick.
You guys got it.

504
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:47,551
No one said it would be easy.

505
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,379
That's why they call it
the Sweat challenge.

506
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:01,758
<i>
We only have four hours.</i>

507
00:23:01,862 --> 00:23:04,206
It's quite a big area
to dig with the two of us.

508
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,172
If we do an "X," we'll be
able to cover more ground.

509
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,827
So I ended up
figuring out we're gonna do

510
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,689
<i>an "X" formation
across the grid.</i>

511
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:25,724
<i>It's gonna cover
the most amount of area</i>

512
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:27,310
with the least amount of effort.

513
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:31,172
I'm pretty good. I do carpentry.

514
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:33,068
My mom taught
me everything I know.

515
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:37,172
I can build quite a bit,
as long as I take my time.

516
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:39,965
<i>So I feel like
working smarter and not harder</i>

517
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:41,965
in the Sweat challenge
really draws back

518
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:43,586
to having to think
outside the box growing up.

519
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:47,620
<i>I was born three months early,</i>

520
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:49,379
<i>which gave me
mild cerebral palsy.</i>

521
00:23:49,482 --> 00:23:53,000
<i>And that not only
affected the ability to walk,</i>

522
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:55,310
<i>but it also affected
the way I think.</i>

523
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:57,586
And having
a stutter in my brain,

524
00:23:57,689 --> 00:24:01,172
it's like having two seconds
of an echo before you're able

525
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:03,310
to figure out, okay,
that's what I need to do.

526
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:05,827
<i>Doctors said I would never walk.</i>

527
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:08,379
<i>And my mother said,
"No, we're not having that."</i>

528
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:09,689
<i>And she took me
to physical therapy</i>

529
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:11,724
<i>every Thursday for four years.</i>

530
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>I developed walking
late in life,</i>

531
00:24:14,103 --> 00:24:16,000
<i>and I had to rewire my brain</i>

532
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:18,413
<i>to be able to function
the way I do today.</i>

533
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:29,034
- Oh. Oh!
- Oh.

534
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:32,758
Yeah!

535
00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:35,689
- I think they finished.

536
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:38,517
Wait, that would be amazing.

537
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,931
Shut up.

538
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:48,482
<i>It only took about 30 minutes
to get this bag out,</i>

539
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:50,620
<i>and we had four hours.</i>

540
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:53,241
Oh, look at that.
It's so nice.

541
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:55,103
<i>To be able to pull off
this challenge feels like</i>

542
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:56,793
<i>everything that
I've been through had a meaning.</i>

543
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,551
Having the confidence
in myself to be,

544
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:00,344
"Hey, this is my idea.
We should try it."

545
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:02,482
- I'm sweaty and sandy.
- Good job! I know...

546
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,827
Good job.

547
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:05,413
<i>
I really feel like I could bring</i>

548
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:07,862
<i>more than just muscle
to the squad.</i>

549
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,482
I did good on this one.

550
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:15,758
- Okay, yeah.
- Right?

551
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:18,827
<i>It's so important, day
one, to be able to have the pot</i>

552
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:20,482
and the flint and the machete.

553
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:23,275
<i>But when everyone saw
the Savvy challenge,</i>

554
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:26,000
<i>we freaked out,
because we don't have any idea</i>

555
00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:27,448
<i>how to figure it out.</i>

556
00:25:27,551 --> 00:25:29,000
There's something
that we're missing.

557
00:25:34,344 --> 00:25:35,896
<i>I wanted to do
the Sweat part of the challenge,</i>

558
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,965
because I'm trying to play to
what people see me as out here.

559
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:40,758
<i>I'm a bigger guy.</i>

560
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:43,275
<i>I kind of do want
to conceal parts of me.</i>

561
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:46,448
<i>Like, I don't want them to know
that I'm good at puzzles because</i>

562
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:48,344
every little thing can be
used against you in this game.

563
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:51,586
<i>But I do want us
to have a good camp.</i>

564
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:54,586
<i>I want us to be organized,
and we can't really do that</i>

565
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:56,344
if I'm sitting here,
trying to hide my strength.

566
00:25:56,448 --> 00:25:58,793
Guys, guys,
watch your minds be blown.

567
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,137
Watch this.

568
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:01,689
- Yeah, okay. Okay.
- Okay. All right, Sami.

569
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,586
- Five, right?
- Okay.

570
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,310
We got a zero.

571
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:06,379
- Okay.
- We got an eight.

572
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,758
Uh-huh.

573
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:10,000
- And then we got a...
- Zero?

574
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:11,551
No. Three ones.

575
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:13,827
You move these two.

576
00:26:13,931 --> 00:26:15,586
- Yeah.
- Oh! It's a six-digit number!

577
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:18,034
- Sami!
- Sami!

578
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:19,655
- Oh, yes, Sami!
- Yeah!

579
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:21,103
Ah! Wait! Hear me out.

580
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:22,310
- Hear me out.

581
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:24,620
Do that here! One, two, three.

582
00:26:24,724 --> 00:26:26,103
- In here, with the same thing.
- 51.

583
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:27,689
- So it'd be...
- 5-1-1...

584
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:29,172
- ...8-1-0.
- Ah.

585
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:31,620
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

586
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:32,724
- That's it.

587
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:35,965
Let's lock it.

588
00:26:36,068 --> 00:26:37,137
- You got this.
- You got this.

589
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:39,896
All righty.

590
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,275
- Everybody blow it a kiss.

591
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,103
- Yay.

592
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:45,068
- That looks amazing.
- 5-1-1-8-1-0.

593
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,275
- Can't touch it now.
- Yeah.

594
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:48,275
- Jeanine, you're gonna drop it.
- Oh, no.

595
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:50,275
- No, someone else.
- Yeah, you drop it.

596
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:51,586
- I'll untie it.
- You do it.

597
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:53,965
- Yes.

598
00:26:54,068 --> 00:26:55,275
Ooh, my heart's pounding.

599
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:56,655
Yes, Elie.

600
00:26:56,758 --> 00:26:58,482
- All right, ready?
- Yeah.

601
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:06,724
I knew I had a spark.

602
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:08,172
- Amazing! Amazing!

603
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:09,758
Like when you spark
a little flint on the fire.

604
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,206
It sparked our group.

605
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,206
<i>I feel really good
about solving the puzzle</i>

606
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,206
<i>and getting us the materials
that we needed,</i>

607
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,206
because I'm 19 years old.

608
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,793
That's not gonna sound good
in a group of people

609
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:20,620
who are experienced
and well-thought-out

610
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:21,655
like-like these people.

611
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:22,896
Wait, you never said your age.

612
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,413
Oh, well, I'm 22.
Sorry if anybody was,

613
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,862
anybody was wondering.

614
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:28,413
<i>So I'm telling people
I am 22 years old.</i>

615
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:30,724
19's just not a good sound
and it's not a good look,

616
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:32,862
<i>regardless of how much
you prove yourself.</i>

617
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:34,551
- You need some help?
- No, you're good.

618
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:37,413
<i>I'm out here doing
what most 19-year-olds can't do,</i>

619
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,034
and I'm gonna be
the youngest to win this game.

620
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:40,241
You're killing it, Sami.

621
00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:51,931
I've made 'em before.

622
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:53,413
- Yeah?
- It's been a while.

623
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:54,965
- And I thought about it...
- It looks awesome.

624
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:56,724
I was like, "I'm gonna
try making one of those again."

625
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:59,241
<i>
I'm extremely happy
that I'm on Vesi tribe.</i>

626
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,931
Doing that first challenge
and kind of having,

627
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:04,379
<i>you know, that winning
atmosphere made it</i>

628
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,827
<i>definitely a lot easier for
people to be happy around camp.</i>

629
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:09,586
My first <i>Survivor</i> meal.

630
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,137
- Oh.
- Yes!

631
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:12,379
Ta-da!

632
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,482
<i>
I think, off the bat,</i>

633
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:15,758
<i>I definitely mesh with Justine,</i>

634
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,103
just because, you know,
we are similar in age.

635
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:20,965
This tree looks
very suspicious to me.

636
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:22,344
Yeah.

637
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:23,758
<i>She is definitely
a very smart girl,</i>

638
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,310
<i>and she's very determined.</i>

639
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,551
- Damn.
- So having that relationship
off the bat,

640
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:28,965
I really, really think

641
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:31,000
that we're gonna do really well
working together.

642
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,482
Yeah.

643
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:35,586
How do you guys feel?

644
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:37,000
The game is afoot.

645
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:39,517
- The game?

647
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:42,241
<i>from the last few seasons is,</i>

648
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:44,241
<i>obviously,
the game is very quick, and</i>

649
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:46,103
I don't have an alliance,
I haven't talked to anybody.

650
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:48,551
<i>I got to do something. So,</i>

651
00:28:48,655 --> 00:28:50,172
I saw my crack, and I took it.

652
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:51,689
- I connect with y'all.
- Yeah? It's all good.

653
00:28:51,793 --> 00:28:53,034
I'll be straight with you.

654
00:28:53,137 --> 00:28:56,379
Feel good about you,
feel good about you.

655
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,655
What do you think? Same? Yeah?

656
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:00,689
- I'm good.
- Let's do it.

657
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:03,724
<i>
Right now I'm excited.</i>

658
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,137
I can very easily
build a relationship

659
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:07,482
with the guys
who are like, hey, easygoing.

660
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:08,896
<i>I work with guys a lot.</i>

661
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,310
<i>I understand that.
And I was like,</i>

662
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:14,551
"All right, first alliance.
Check, check. You know?"

663
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah, me, too.

664
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:19,551
I always fear any salesperson

665
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:21,482
in this game.

666
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:23,275
- Justine?
- Mm-hmm, because

667
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:25,862
<i>they're so good at, like,
the game, right?</i>

668
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,000
The dynamics of how it flows.

669
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:29,448
- Yeah.
- And that, that fears me.

670
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:33,103
When I found out that Justine is
a sales representative,

671
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:35,172
I was stoked. Like,

672
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:38,137
<i>there is a stereotype with
salespeople-- like, manipulative</i>

673
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:40,620
<i>or, uh, BS-er. So,</i>

674
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:43,103
I'm making sure everybody knows
that Justine is a sales rep.

675
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:47,137
That's the salesperson.

676
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:49,827
Like, that's-that's my fear.

677
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:51,310
<i>
I've told my tribemates that</i>

678
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:53,137
<i>I work
for an elevator company, but</i>

679
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,034
I don't need them to know
that I'm a salesperson.

680
00:29:55,137 --> 00:29:57,000
- I mean, I'm glad
that we're talking.
- Yeah.

681
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:58,689
And we can get something going.

682
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:01,379
<i>
I do sales
for the elevator company.</i>

683
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:03,655
<i>Been doing it for a long time,
and, um,</i>

684
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:05,379
my motto coming
into this was not telling people

685
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:07,379
I'm a salesperson.
You can be damn well, I'm going

686
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,448
to be going after the person
that's a salesperson.

687
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:12,448
Yeah.

688
00:30:16,034 --> 00:30:17,896
-  Right?

689
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,758
<i>
I really like Cody and Nneka,
but for me,</i>

690
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,793
<i>I think the game plan is to not
do too much at this point.</i>

691
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:26,000
Like, day one,
I want to sort of sit back.

692
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:28,827
I want to see, like, who is just
naturally sort of cliquing up.

693
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:30,896
I initially cliqued with Noelle,

694
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,965
and I think that's, like,
natural 'cause we...

695
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:35,206
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- are around the same age, and...

696
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,896
<i>But I think that, like,
I can definitely</i>

697
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,241
see myself trusting you.

698
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:40,689
<i>
At this point,</i>

699
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:42,344
<i>I'm in a really good position.</i>

700
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:45,103
<i>Nneka and Cody want
to work with me,</i>

701
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:46,620
<i>but then on the other side</i>

702
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:48,586
<i>the two girls
Justine and Noelle are tight,</i>

703
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:49,931
and they want to pull me in.

704
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:51,551
<i>Back home,
I don't have very many friends.</i>

705
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:54,241
<i>Like, it's me, my wife,
and my kids, so, like,</i>

706
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:57,379
I don't really get invited to
parties or anything like that.

707
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:59,034
But out here
I got, like, two invitations

708
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:00,862
to two separate parties,
and now

709
00:31:00,965 --> 00:31:02,793
I have to figure out
which one I want to go to.

710
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,586
<i>
I'm going to take this out.</i>

711
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:07,965
<i>- Yes.
- I'm gonna put it here.</i>

712
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,620
<i>- We'll do a triangle here. Okay?
- Cool.</i>

713
00:31:09,724 --> 00:31:11,000
<i>
Sami, just watch yourself.</i>

714
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,344
I'm going to come over you.

715
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:13,896
You're gonna go over my head. Okay.

716
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,655
You're going to put it up
on that "Y" branch.

717
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,758
Back a bit more.

718
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:20,241
- There we go.
- Good job.

719
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,000
<i>
People are working hard.</i>

720
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:25,000
<i>Elie, Morriah and Jeanine have
been weaving fronds all day.</i>

721
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:27,137
Okay, now let's put it up.

722
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:29,068
- Whoa.
- Okay.

723
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:30,413
Hey, we're going
to figure it out, guys.

724
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:31,931
- We sure are.
- I'm worried.

725
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,448
ELIE [laughing]:
Oh, no.

726
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:34,793
<i>
God willing, we will have</i>

727
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:37,068
<i>a beautiful shelter,
but the minutiae</i>

728
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:38,517
<i>we're putting into the shelter</i>

729
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,827
<i>is not how I would want
to expend my energy.</i>

730
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:43,068
- I'm getting real thirsty.
I might...
- I know, I know.

731
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:45,172
That well water's looking
pretty good right around now.

732
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:46,551
<i>This 26-day game</i>

733
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,793
is so much more rapid.

734
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:50,827
<i>I need to sneak off
and start strategizing.</i>

735
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:55,241
We'll keep an eye out
for each other.

736
00:31:57,413 --> 00:31:59,103
Hopefully, we can...
You know, the number one rule

737
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:01,862
of Tribal Council is don't go.

738
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:04,551
<i>
"Hey, if I hear your name,
Gabler, I'll let you know."</i>

739
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:06,620
<i>That's not a whole lot.
I mean, this is</i> Survivor.

740
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,724
That's not like
a blood pact or anything crazy.

741
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,034
I will definitely...
will let you know

742
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,448
if I hear your name coming up.

743
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:13,758
Yes, I will for sure
let you know.

744
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:15,551
That's so weird to say.

745
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:17,137
- No, I mean, it's--
that's what we're doing.

746
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:19,068
- Yeah.
- Are you getting
good vibes from anybody?

747
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:21,206
- Honestly, I'm getting
good vibes from everyone.
- Yeah.

748
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,137
No one seems to be scheming.
No one's, like,

749
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,241
trying to do too much.

750
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,758
<i>People have been very guarded.
No one wants</i>

751
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,724
<i>to jump out as being strategic,
and it's...</i>

752
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:31,241
it's a little frustrating.

753
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:32,724
<i>The way alliances are going
right now,</i>

754
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:35,068
<i>it's like we're trying
to chop these coconuts.</i>

755
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:36,482
<i>Just hacking away, hacking away.</i>

756
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:37,655
<i>And just bang, bang, bang.</i>

757
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:39,275
<i>Like, open up, open up.</i>

758
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:41,000
And I think,
later on in the game,

759
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,931
<i>it might bite us in the butt.</i>

760
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:46,068
A little more coconut pressure's
gonna do it.

761
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:50,413
So, my oldest sister is 42.

762
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:52,965
I have a sister who's 35, 33,

763
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:54,448
- 30, 28.
- Okay.

764
00:32:54,551 --> 00:32:56,655
My oldest half sister is, like,

765
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:58,034
- 18 years older.
- Okay.

766
00:32:58,137 --> 00:32:59,931
But I have one full sister,

767
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:02,034
but she passed away.

768
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:05,413
- Oh... I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

769
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:06,482
I'm so sorry.

770
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:09,068
Yeah, but she...
she died in 2020.

771
00:33:09,172 --> 00:33:13,413
Definitely the worst thing
that ever happened in my life.

772
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,068
<i>When we were growing up,
my sister was my hero.</i>

773
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:19,103
<i>She's smarter than me,
she's prettier than me.</i>

774
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,413
<i>She is everything to me.</i>

775
00:33:21,517 --> 00:33:24,413
And then there was this
major trauma that happened

776
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:27,586
<i>to my entire family, and I think
that my sister dealt with it by</i>

777
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:28,724
using drugs.

778
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:33,758
<i>I tried to help guide her
through the struggles</i>

779
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:37,206
<i>that she experienced, and our
relationship became strained.</i>

780
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,344
<i>And we hadn't spoken in a year.</i>

781
00:33:40,448 --> 00:33:43,103
<i>The last conversation
that we had was aboutSurvivor,</i>

782
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:45,241
<i>and it was just like
I was talking</i>

783
00:33:45,344 --> 00:33:47,344
<i>to the sister that I knew.</i>

784
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:50,068
Um, but she told me
that she was proud of me,

785
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:52,241
and she told me
she was excited for me.

786
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:54,172
And the most important thing
she said--

787
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:56,103
"Whatever you need, I got you."

788
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:58,379
<i>I hadn't felt that
for a long time.</i>

789
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:01,862
<i>That was the last conversation
that I had with her because</i>

790
00:34:01,965 --> 00:34:05,586
six months later,
she died of... of an overdose.

791
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:07,413
- No amount of time
makes it not...
- Yeah.

792
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:08,793
- just, like, kill you.
- Yeah.

793
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:12,241
Oh, my goodness.

794
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:13,620
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

795
00:34:13,724 --> 00:34:15,310
- Oh.
- Thank you.

796
00:34:16,482 --> 00:34:18,413
- Make room.

797
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:22,310
<i>
I feel closer
to Jeanine and Morriah</i>

798
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:23,965
because of that moment.

799
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:26,206
- Yeah.
- Right?

800
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,172
Yes!

801
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,482
- Seriously.
- Yes.

802
00:34:30,586 --> 00:34:32,758
<i>
I think we're a good three,
and I definitely</i>

803
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,413
want to play
with women in this game.

804
00:34:34,517 --> 00:34:36,172
<i>It feels totally natural to me.</i>

805
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:39,689
It's powerful.

806
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:41,068
<i>
I feel my sister here with me.</i>

807
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:42,413
<i>She would be happy</i>

808
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:43,724
that I'm in a good spot
right now.

809
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:50,517
- Ugh.

810
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,931
Doesn't taste that good.

811
00:34:52,034 --> 00:34:55,103
You could put bamboo this way.

812
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:56,758
- Slide...
- Push it, push it, slide more.

813
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,758
-  Here we go.
- Yup. There we go.

814
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:00,379
I would push it more this way.

815
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:02,551
<i>We have the plans
to start building the shelter.</i>

816
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:04,137
<i>You know, some people are going</i>

817
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:05,482
<i>to weave palm fronds,
some people are going</i>

818
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:06,586
<i>to start cutting bamboo.</i>

819
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,758
<i>But I'm in the game now,</i>

820
00:35:08,862 --> 00:35:09,931
and it's time
to start strategizing.

821
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:15,620
You know, always nervous.

822
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:16,965
- I know, me, too.
- Yeah.

823
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:18,689
- But I really like you.
- I like you, too.

824
00:35:18,793 --> 00:35:20,310
I feel like we're dating.
I'm just kidding, right? Like...

825
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:21,896
Yeah, I know, like...

826
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,896
<i>I want to play like a fox--
clever and cunning.</i>

827
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,862
I want to outmaneuver people.
I want to be sneaky.

828
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:28,241
<i>I don't want to play a loud,</i>

829
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:29,827
in-your-face game
because a lot of times

830
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:31,965
women can't get away with that
the same way that men can.

831
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:34,000
- If we have to go
to Tribal Council tomorrow...
- I know.

832
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:35,758
- I want to have a game plan.
- Yeah.

833
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:38,379
<i>
There are some loud voices
on this tribe,</i>

834
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:42,931
<i>and it allows me to stay
behind the scenes, and nobody</i>

835
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:46,103
sees me as, like, a huge threat
until it's too late.

836
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:49,448
Okay.

837
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:51,517
So if you see James
and I talking, I promise you...

838
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,896
You're working it.

839
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,206
...we're not hiding anything
from you guys.

840
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,758
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay?

841
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,310
<i>I love</i> Survivor, <i>and</i>

842
00:35:58,413 --> 00:35:59,793
I always said
that I wanted to be able

843
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:01,758
to have
an all-girls alliance.

844
00:36:01,862 --> 00:36:03,896
- Because at the end
of the day...
- Yeah.

845
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,448
the three of us--
it's what's going

846
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:06,655
- to keep us alive in this game.
- Yeah.
- It is.

847
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:08,793
- Honestly.
- Seriously.

848
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:10,620
The girls and I got together.

849
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:13,793
<i>But for numbers, I want
to pull James into our alliance.</i>

850
00:36:13,896 --> 00:36:15,310
<i>I think</i>

851
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:16,586
he's very genuine out here.

852
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:21,724
I know.

853
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:23,310
- Mm-hmm.
- I like your vibe.

854
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:25,068
- Cool.
- I think we work well together.

855
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:26,413
That's the name of my company--
Good Vibes Only.

856
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,758
- It is not.
- It is.

857
00:36:27,862 --> 00:36:29,241
<i>
I feel like</i>

858
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:30,655
my biggest trick to this game
is going to be my ability

859
00:36:30,758 --> 00:36:31,862
to connect with almost anybody.

860
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:38,344
What do you think?

861
00:36:39,379 --> 00:36:42,137
<i>Growing up in Philly,
I learned how to play chess, and</i>

862
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,965
<i>I won the U.S. Open when I was
13 for my ratings bracket.</i>

863
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:46,862
<i>Traveling around the country,
I would be surprised</i>

864
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:48,413
<i>to be the only Black kid
at tournaments.</i>

865
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:50,482
<i>In chess, you figure out
who you're playing,</i>

866
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,310
<i>and you're trying to figure out</i>

867
00:36:52,413 --> 00:36:53,413
what they're going to do.

868
00:36:53,517 --> 00:36:54,862
<i>And now being on</i> Survivor...

869
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:58,241
Lindsay and Karla--
they're all solid with you.

870
00:36:58,344 --> 00:36:59,379
<i>
...all three women have said</i>

871
00:36:59,482 --> 00:37:00,551
<i>they wanted to work with me,</i>

872
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:03,103
<i>and I'm the lone guy. Like,</i>

873
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:04,517
that's great.

874
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,724
<i>It's always better
to let people feel like</i>

875
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:08,000
<i>they have the upper hand.</i>

876
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:09,310
I want to be a king,

877
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:10,724
but I'm gonna look
like the pawn.

878
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:24,517
This is so much harder

879
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,448
- than at home. Geez.

880
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:28,965
You think it's just too humid?
That's what it is?

881
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:31,172
There's just
too much humidity in the air?

882
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:32,517
You got it, Mike.

883
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,896
Come on.

884
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:38,896
Man! Why isn't it burning?

885
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,275
Is that husk not flammable?

886
00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:41,413
Yeah, maybe so.

887
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,586
<i>When you hear "pet
cremator," all you think of is,</i>

888
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:47,965
I'm a guy that grabs dogs
and cats and lizards by the feet

889
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:49,551
and throws 'em in a fire.

890
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:51,310
Put a bunch of magnesium
on there.

891
00:37:53,206 --> 00:37:56,000
<i>
I actually gracefully
lay them in the incinerator, and</i>

892
00:37:56,103 --> 00:37:57,517
I'm not killing the pet.

893
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,241
- Well...
- Okay, that's our firepit
for the...

894
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,689
- So you get... you get it going,
and I'll just pick it up.
- Cool.

895
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:03,379
<i>
But I know from experience,</i>

896
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:05,655
<i>fire is something I know I can
do, just like with the shih tzu</i>

897
00:38:05,758 --> 00:38:07,482
<i>that I put in the incinerator.</i>

898
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,793
- Elie, come over here.
- Fire!

899
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:15,000
- Oh, my God, guys.
- Little sticks, guys.

900
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:16,965
Teamwork, as usual.

901
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:19,620
- Oh, my God.
- Baka teamwork, guys.

902
00:38:19,724 --> 00:38:20,931
Oh, my God. You are...

903
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:22,448
- Sami!
- Hey!

904
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,517
- Sami!

905
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,793
Sami lit the fire!

906
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:29,758
Guys, we're cooking.
We're literally cooking.

907
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,689
Amazing.
Okay, we can exhale now.

908
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,103
<i>
This was not a start that I had</i>

909
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:38,965
planned on or envisioned.

910
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:40,862
Watch out. It's going
to be nice and toasty there.

911
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:43,034
<i>I'm older than my teammates.</i>

912
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:45,103
<i>I think that basically points</i>

913
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:47,379
everybody against you
and makes you an easy target.

914
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:50,448
<i>So, my strategy is basically</i>

915
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:53,103
<i>connect with them
and to bond with them.</i>

916
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:55,758
<i>And I think</i>

917
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:57,827
there's always somebody teaching
somebody what to do,

918
00:38:57,931 --> 00:38:59,620
and, you know, sometimes
I'm the one being taught,

919
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:01,862
which is awesome at 51.

920
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,172
- Yeah, like, Mastodon.
- Oh, that's...

921
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:05,862
- Mastodon is great.
- I mean...

922
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,655
Yeah, it's really good.
Sex Pistols...

923
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:08,965
- It's just really good music.
- Yeah.

924
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:10,517
<i>
My sister loved metal.</i>

925
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,448
<i>And Gabler--
he listens to heavy metal.</i>

926
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,379
I'm like, "Yeah, Mastodon.
I listen to that."

927
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:18,827
Uh, Dead Kennedys.

928
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:21,241
I'm, like, pulling
from my sister up in space,

929
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,689
being like, "What were
those punk bands you like?"

930
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,034
And he loved it,

931
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:25,965
<i>so we bonded on that real quick.</i>

932
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:27,931
Well, it's been
great playing with you.

933
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,655
You let me know how I can help
you in this game, too, okay?

934
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:30,965
Oh, yeah. Same here.

935
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,344
If I can help you,
if I hear your name.

936
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:34,103
I'll let you know.

937
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,655
<i>I think he feels like we're
probably kindred spirits, and</i>

938
00:39:35,758 --> 00:39:37,896
in a way, we are.
I genuinely respect him.

939
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,448
- Yeah, absolutely. Deal.
- Yeah, yeah.

940
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:40,965
All right, I'll let you know.

941
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:42,689
<i>He's really sweet
and he's caring.</i>

942
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:44,310
<i>I might want to work with him.</i>

943
00:39:44,413 --> 00:39:47,379
I'm not ruling him out at all.

944
00:39:53,034 --> 00:39:55,344
Somebody want coconut water?

945
00:39:55,448 --> 00:39:57,586
I'm out here laying
on the floor.

946
00:39:57,689 --> 00:40:01,000
Crazy. I'm from Philly!
This is not what we do!

947
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:11,103
Um, so it was hard for them

948
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:14,172
to understand and accept
that we were together.

949
00:40:14,275 --> 00:40:16,034
But now we're really good, actually.

950
00:40:16,137 --> 00:40:17,965
<i>
Me and Karla-- we kind of,
like, started vibing.</i>

951
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:20,793
<i>We're both married, both gay,</i>

952
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:22,758
and we're both Latino.

953
00:40:22,862 --> 00:40:24,482
She's from Mexico,
I'm from Peru.

954
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:26,034
So we have a lot in common.

955
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:30,034
Mm-hmm.

956
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:41,000
Yes.

957
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,034
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

958
00:40:58,137 --> 00:40:59,689
I know.

959
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,551
<i>I play with my heart,
and I feel like</i>

960
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:04,793
I want people to see the type
of person that I am,

961
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,379
and I want people
to see my life.

962
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:10,137
<i>I think that's going
to be a good way to get people</i>

963
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:11,689
<i>to open up about themselves,</i>

964
00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:13,310
so that way
we can feel more connected

965
00:41:13,413 --> 00:41:14,862
and we can work together.

966
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:18,000
Thanks.

967
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:23,620
You know?

968
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,137
So...

969
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:29,965
<i>Coming into this game,
I was just</i>

970
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:31,482
so nervous. Like, no one's
going to want to work with me.

971
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:32,758
They're going to see me
and they're going to be like,

972
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:34,241
"Who the hell is this girl?"

973
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:36,448
<i>But now it feels like
I've spoken to everyone.</i>

974
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:38,655
So...

975
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:43,896
Okay.

976
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,620
Yeah.

977
00:41:48,724 --> 00:41:51,793
<i>
At this point, it feels like
that Geo, Ryan and myself--</i>

978
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:53,620
<i>the three of us are solid,</i>

979
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:59,275
<i>but I'm also working with James,
Lindsay and Cassidy.</i>

980
00:41:59,379 --> 00:42:01,551
It feels like I'm in the middle.

981
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:03,310
Let's try not
to spend too much time, like,

982
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:05,206
all of us hanging out together

983
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,379
- because
I don't want people to suspect.
- Yeah.

984
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:09,413
<i>
Coming in, I was</i>

985
00:42:09,517 --> 00:42:12,413
very nervous that
I would be perceived as weak,

986
00:42:12,517 --> 00:42:15,793
<i>that people would think that I
won't do well on our challenges.</i>

987
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:18,241
<i>I honestly thought
I was going to go out first,</i>

988
00:42:18,344 --> 00:42:21,482
<i>so it's hard to trust that
everyone wants to talk to me</i>

989
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:23,413
<i>and solidify my vote.</i>

990
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:25,344
<i>So I don't know what to believe.</i>

991
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:27,137
I don't think
this is good for people

992
00:42:27,241 --> 00:42:30,482
:
to be, like.... this scrambled.

993
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:41,310
I had a couple tattoos, man,
so this is just, uh...

994
00:42:41,413 --> 00:42:43,344
I had one
on the back of my head removed.

995
00:42:43,448 --> 00:42:45,310
- What?
- Had one on my face.

996
00:42:45,413 --> 00:42:47,137
You had a tattoo on your face?

997
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:48,551
Yes, sir.

998
00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:50,551
Where was the one on your face?

999
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:51,862
Like, was it, like,
a Mike Tyson tattoo?

1000
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:53,689
No, it was, uh, three dots.

1001
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:55,172
- I had three dots right here.
- Oh.

1002
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:57,965
- Tattoo?
- Yeah, right here.

1003
00:42:58,068 --> 00:43:00,103
When I was a teenager,
I was, I was in a gang,

1004
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:02,068
- and so...
- Oh.

1005
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:03,862
- Sort of juvenile hall
and stuff like that.
- Yeah.

1006
00:43:03,965 --> 00:43:05,275
Ended up meeting some,

1007
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:06,724
like, really cool nonprofits

1008
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:08,241
- that were able to help me out.
- Yeah.

1009
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:10,551
They, uh, were able
to, like, pay for, like, things

1010
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:13,172
- like getting the tattoo off
the back of my head.
- Wow.

1011
00:43:13,275 --> 00:43:15,034
<i>
Yeah, I'm not the type
to walk in a room</i>

1012
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:16,896
<i>and just sort of
advertise my background.</i>

1013
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,344
<i>I grew up
in Los Angeles, California.</i>

1014
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:21,000
My family didn't
have college degrees.

1015
00:43:21,103 --> 00:43:22,448
They had, like, addictions, right?

1016
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:24,448
Nobody went to college.
They went to prison.

1017
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:26,448
<i>You know, I ended up in a gang</i>

1018
00:43:26,551 --> 00:43:28,448
<i>and I ended up getting arrested</i>

1019
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:31,172
<i>and going
to juvenile hall at 17.</i>

1020
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,241
<i>When I was in juvenile hall,
I was lucky enough</i>

1021
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,068
<i>to be in an educational program,</i>

1022
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:37,379
<i>and they offered
a GED test there.</i>

1023
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:39,103
<i>And I took the GED test,</i>

1024
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:41,724
<i>and I got one of the highest
scores that they had seen.</i>

1025
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,344
Like, that's when I think it was
sort of like a switch went off,

1026
00:43:44,448 --> 00:43:45,689
you know, and I was like,
"All right,

1027
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:47,275
let me try
and, like, shift gears here."

1028
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:49,241
<i>And so, that's when I started,
like, doing things</i>

1029
00:43:49,344 --> 00:43:51,448
<i>to better myself,
better my situation.</i>

1030
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:54,620
<i>And I got accepted at Berkeley,
which was insane,</i>

1031
00:43:54,724 --> 00:43:56,172
<i>and then went on to Duke.</i>

1032
00:43:56,275 --> 00:43:57,862
<i>And now I have a PhD
in political science.</i>

1033
00:43:57,965 --> 00:44:01,241
<i>But coming out here,
I just want to show my family,</i>

1034
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:03,344
<i>my son, my daughter that, like,
you can do anything you want.</i>

1035
00:44:03,448 --> 00:44:05,551
<i>But at the same time,
I feel like</i>

1036
00:44:05,655 --> 00:44:08,344
I need to represent because,
like, there's a lot of kids

1037
00:44:08,448 --> 00:44:10,724
who, you know, are sitting
in juvenile hall right now,

1038
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:12,896
<i>locked up in the same room
that I was in,</i>

1039
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,068
<i>thinking
that they can't make it.</i>

1040
00:44:15,172 --> 00:44:17,103
<i>And I want to show people
that you can go</i>

1041
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:19,068
<i>from sitting
in a juvenile hall with</i>

1042
00:44:19,172 --> 00:44:21,413
a tattoo on your face
and on the back of your head,

1043
00:44:21,517 --> 00:44:22,896
uh, to, you know,

1044
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,103
<i>sitting out here
in Fiji with a PhD.</i>

1045
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,413
Where's that shell?

1046
00:44:28,517 --> 00:44:29,586
I just kind of wanted
to go for something.

1047
00:44:29,689 --> 00:44:31,068
Like, put the L.A. in there.

1048
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:32,793
Sort of like the belly
of the beast kind of thing.

1049
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:34,413
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

1050
00:44:34,517 --> 00:44:36,517
But, uh, he has a cooler one
than me, though.

1051
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,965
- Really? What do you have, Cody?

1052
00:44:39,068 --> 00:44:40,103
Where is it?

1053
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,034
Oh, great. Okay.

1054
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,620
Livin'.

1055
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:48,896
Two exclamation points
and a smiley face.

1056
00:44:56,896 --> 00:44:59,034
You got it.

1057
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,448
<i>
I grew up doing a lot of things</i>

1058
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:05,586
<i>that are not typical
of young girls.</i>

1059
00:45:05,689 --> 00:45:07,413
<i>Like, my dad and I
had matching dirt bikes,</i>

1060
00:45:07,517 --> 00:45:10,551
<i>and we would be camping out
in the trunk of our Jeep.</i>

1061
00:45:10,655 --> 00:45:12,655
- I'm manifesting.
- Absolutely.

1062
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:14,034
You're gonna get it.

1063
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:16,379
<i>
So, coming into</i> Survivor,

1064
00:45:16,482 --> 00:45:17,965
I was like,
"I can build a fire."

1065
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:20,137
- Damn.

1066
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:22,310
<i>
And then it's very humbling when</i>

1067
00:45:22,413 --> 00:45:23,689
we can't do it.

1068
00:45:23,793 --> 00:45:25,379
Wow. Good job, you guys.

1069
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:27,172
<i>But at the same time,
like, I'm super impressed</i>

1070
00:45:27,275 --> 00:45:29,206
<i>with how our tribe
has been doing so far.</i>

1071
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,206
Wow. This looks like
a really good shelter.

1072
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,206
Yes, it would be amazing
if we had fire,

1073
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,206
but I'm just thankful
that we have a shelter.

1074
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:38,310
Better. There... Like, I think

1075
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:39,965
at the very top,
it's kind of loose.

1076
00:45:41,758 --> 00:45:43,068
- You okay? You good?
- You okay?

1077
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:44,689
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm fine. I'm fine. Y'all?

1078
00:45:44,793 --> 00:45:46,000
- I'm good.
- Yeah, you good?

1079
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:47,482
- I'm good.
-Oh, man.

1080
00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:48,827
- Is everybody all right?
- I'm good.
- That's it.

1081
00:45:48,931 --> 00:45:50,448
I'm-I'm good.
Oh, my God, we have a fire!

1082
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:56,965
<i>
So, we broke our shelter
immediately,</i>

1083
00:45:57,068 --> 00:45:59,310
collapses on my head,
the girls get the fire going.

1084
00:45:59,413 --> 00:46:01,448
Ugh! It's going out, guys.

1085
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,310
That sucks.

1086
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:05,344
<i>
The fire then goes out.
It's a complete disaster.</i>

1087
00:46:05,448 --> 00:46:07,586
So while we had a leg up
on the competition,

1088
00:46:07,689 --> 00:46:09,344
we also kind of
took a few steps back.

1089
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,689
Just when we think
that we're actually relaxing,

1090
00:46:21,793 --> 00:46:24,551
like, everybody's hanging out,
yeah, a boat shows up.

1091
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:25,896
Oh, God.

1092
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,103
- Oh, no.
- Okay.

1093
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:31,206
<i>
We all know.</i>

1094
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,862
Here we go. Like,
that boat ain't coming here

1095
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:35,379
to drop us off some goodies.

1096
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:38,413
- I'm scared.
- I'm scared, too.

1097
00:46:38,517 --> 00:46:40,379
It was on like <i>Donkey Kong.</i>

1098
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,379
You guys.

1099
00:47:01,275 --> 00:47:02,689
<i>So, we're all sitting
on the beach,</i>

1100
00:47:02,793 --> 00:47:04,620
<i>and all of a sudden
we see a boat pull up.</i>

1101
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:09,000
<i>
Coming out here, I thought</i>

1102
00:47:09,103 --> 00:47:11,103
<i>about this exact scenario,</i>

1103
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:13,551
but I have no idea
what's about to happen.

1104
00:47:13,655 --> 00:47:16,482
:
How exciting!

1105
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:19,965
- Oh!
- Ah!

1106
00:47:20,068 --> 00:47:23,034
<i>
In this new era
of</i> Survivor, <i>you 100%</i>

1107
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:24,620
<i>have to make big moves to win.</i>

1108
00:47:24,724 --> 00:47:27,344
<i>I'm not scared
of what is coming.</i>

1109
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,793
I'm not scared
of the game of <i>Survivor.</i>

1110
00:47:29,896 --> 00:47:33,103
I'm scared of never having
the opportunity to play.

1111
00:47:33,206 --> 00:47:35,034
"One person
must get on this boat.

1112
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:38,275
You'll return to camp
this afternoon." That's it.

1113
00:47:38,379 --> 00:47:39,724
Okay. Who's staying?

1114
00:47:39,827 --> 00:47:41,206
- Oh, we have to stay.
We got to.
- Okay.

1115
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:42,310
We got to work on the shelter.

1116
00:47:42,413 --> 00:47:44,275
What can we do? Draw sticks?

1117
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:46,931
We had to pick somebody
to go to an adventure.

1118
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:48,724
<i>I'm thinking
the most democratic way.</i>

1119
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:50,103
Pick a number
between one and 20.

1120
00:47:50,206 --> 00:47:52,310
- 17.
- 14.

1121
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:53,862
- 20.
- Seven.

1122
00:47:53,965 --> 00:47:55,344
- She got it on the... on the...
- Blackjack.

1123
00:47:55,448 --> 00:47:56,586
- Did it.
- Really?
- Yeah, blackjack.

1124
00:47:56,689 --> 00:47:59,068
<i>Karla got the seven, and</i>

1125
00:47:59,172 --> 00:48:00,448
this is the new era,

1126
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:02,931
<i>so we know
she's going off somewhere,</i>

1127
00:48:03,034 --> 00:48:05,310
and there's going to be an
advantage or something in play.

1128
00:48:05,413 --> 00:48:08,172
-
Have fun. Have a ton of fun.
- Oh, my God!

1129
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:10,206
<i>
Advantages change things up.</i>

1130
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,000
Someone that was nice
and sweet can be a villain.

1131
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:22,482
- Okay, go, let's do it.
- Okay. I'm ready.
- Okay.

1132
00:48:22,586 --> 00:48:23,827
- One, two.
- One, two.

1133
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:25,517
- One, two, three.
- Go.

1134
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,448
<i>
Deep down, of course, you want</i>

1135
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:29,482
to go on the journey. Like, you
want to go see what it's about.

1136
00:48:29,586 --> 00:48:31,448
40, 41, 42, 43.

1137
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:33,586
- All right!

1138
00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:35,000
<i>
But I was totally okay</i>

1139
00:48:35,103 --> 00:48:37,379
with putting it out
to a random draw because

1140
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:38,931
<i>you don't want to put a target
on your back by being</i>

1141
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:40,655
<i>so eager, especially when</i>

1142
00:48:40,758 --> 00:48:42,586
there is something like an
advantage, and everybody knows

1143
00:48:42,689 --> 00:48:44,379
about the possibility
of it being there.

1144
00:48:49,068 --> 00:48:50,655
You know you want to, bro.

1145
00:48:50,758 --> 00:48:52,103
- Kind of do,
but I kind of don't.
- This is your dream

1146
00:48:52,206 --> 00:48:53,103
to go out there and do this.

1147
00:48:53,206 --> 00:48:55,517
All right.

1148
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,275
<i>
Dwight is a superfan,
so he wanted to go.</i>

1149
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:58,827
<i>I mean, him</i>

1150
00:48:58,931 --> 00:49:00,827
getting on the boat was
a wake-up call for everybody.

1151
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:02,068
<i>Like, I could tell
everybody was like,</i>

1152
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,000
<i>"Now the game has started."</i>

1153
00:49:04,103 --> 00:49:06,517
I mean, he might be out for
a boat ride, having a picnic,

1154
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,206
<i>but my guess is that</i>

1155
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,000
something's going to go down.

1156
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:32,689
<i>
I'm on this boat, and</i>

1157
00:49:32,793 --> 00:49:35,241
I don't know
what's happening whatsoever.

1158
00:49:35,344 --> 00:49:37,758
<i>So I'm really nervous.</i>

1159
00:49:37,862 --> 00:49:39,206
- Karla.
- Gabler.

1160
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,034
- Nice to meet you.
- Gabler. Aw. Nice to meet you.

1161
00:49:41,137 --> 00:49:42,551
Dwight.

1162
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,862
<i>
But I was actually really</i>

1163
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:45,137
<i>calming myself down</i>

1164
00:49:45,241 --> 00:49:48,206
<i>because,
if I come in level-headed</i>

1165
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,724
for whatever the task is,
I will be fine.

1166
00:49:50,827 --> 00:49:54,206
"Make your way from the beach
to the giant rock,

1167
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:56,241
"where you will
make a group decision.

1168
00:49:56,344 --> 00:49:58,413
Take this time
to get to know each other."

1169
00:49:58,517 --> 00:50:01,689
- The giant rock being... that?
No, I...
- The big boy.

1170
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:03,137
- I think that's the giant.
- Out there?

1171
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:04,482
I think we head out there.

1172
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:05,827
Yeah, I guess so.

1173
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:07,689
- All right, let's do it.

1174
00:50:07,793 --> 00:50:09,862
<i>
I look over, and I can
already see the giant rock.</i>

1175
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,551
And I'm like,
"It can't possibly be that bad.

1176
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:13,137
"It's just right there.

1177
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:14,931
"It's going to be, like,
a two- or three-minute walk.

1178
00:50:15,034 --> 00:50:16,310
We're gonna have barely
any time to talk."

1179
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,310
<i>I was so,</i>

1180
00:50:19,413 --> 00:50:20,896
so wrong about that.

1181
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,827
Do we have
to make it over there?

1182
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:24,448
- Yeah.
- What?

1183
00:50:24,551 --> 00:50:26,103
Yup, we got a ways to go, Karla.

1184
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:28,310
- Oh, we have a long way.
- Okay, is anyone else afraid
to hike?

1185
00:50:28,413 --> 00:50:30,689
<i>
In this journey,</i>

1186
00:50:30,793 --> 00:50:32,827
<i>you're kind of going through
these, like,</i>

1187
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:35,137
<i>really slippery, dangerous</i>

1188
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,655
rocks and covered with moss.

1189
00:50:37,758 --> 00:50:41,137
- Oh, here. It's slippery.
- It's super slippery.

1190
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:43,724
So I'm trying
to calm myself down, I'm trying

1191
00:50:43,827 --> 00:50:47,482
<i>to breathe and remind myself,
like, why I am out here.</i>

1192
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:51,241
<i>I'm the proud daughter
of two Mexican immigrants.</i>

1193
00:50:51,344 --> 00:50:55,344
<i>I grew up poor, but I'm not
going to settle for less.</i>

1194
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:58,620
<i>And that ignited a fire in me
to pursue education.</i>

1195
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:00,793
<i>I got into UC Berkeley.</i>

1196
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:04,724
<i>I thought to myself,
"How am I going to pay for it?"</i>

1197
00:51:04,827 --> 00:51:06,206
<i>And then I got the word
that I was awarded</i>

1198
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:08,689
the Bill and Melinda Gates
Millennium Scholarship.

1199
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:12,413
<i>I am the first in my family
to graduate high school.</i>

1200
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:15,689
<i>I was the first in my family
to graduate college.</i>

1201
00:51:15,793 --> 00:51:17,379
It's like a generational change.

1202
00:51:17,482 --> 00:51:20,724
<i>So, I need to remember that</i>

1203
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,896
I am street-smart
and I'm book-smart,

1204
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,586
<i>and for this game
I have to channel that.</i>

1205
00:51:26,689 --> 00:51:28,000
I'm ready to do what it takes.

1206
00:51:28,103 --> 00:51:30,000
- Oh.
- O... kay.

1207
00:51:30,103 --> 00:51:31,655
Okay. Oh, my gosh.
Here we go.

1208
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:33,206
Okay.

1209
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,827
- Okay.
- Interesting.

1210
00:51:57,931 --> 00:52:00,689
<i>
So, what happens is, each player</i>

1211
00:52:00,793 --> 00:52:02,862
chooses secretly
if they want to risk

1212
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:04,517
<i>or not risk their vote,</i>

1213
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,793
<i>and we all reveal the card
we choose simultaneously.</i>

1214
00:52:06,896 --> 00:52:09,275
Based on how many people choose
to risk their vote,

1215
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:13,827
<i>they draw from a bag
of that many risk-takers.</i>

1216
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:16,586
<i>One has an advantage,
all of the rest</i>

1217
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:17,655
lose their vote.

1218
00:52:17,758 --> 00:52:19,241
So now we have to figure out...

1219
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,586
How this is going down.

1220
00:52:20,689 --> 00:52:22,103
...if we want to risk it.

1221
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:24,172
<i>
It's like a game
of poker, right?</i>

1222
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:25,965
Uh, you know, what are the odds?

1223
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,655
<i>Risk, no risk.</i>

1224
00:52:29,758 --> 00:52:32,034
<i>It could lead to an advantage.</i>

1225
00:52:32,137 --> 00:52:34,379
<i>It could lead to an idol.</i>

1226
00:52:34,482 --> 00:52:36,103
<i>But, honey, your vote is</i>

1227
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:37,241
your life right now.

1228
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:39,034
You thinking about risking it?

1229
00:52:39,137 --> 00:52:41,551
I'm thinking pretty big. Yeah.

1230
00:52:41,655 --> 00:52:43,275
<i>I was half bluffing.</i>

1231
00:52:43,379 --> 00:52:45,793
<i>I was trying to say it so
confidently so that they would</i>

1232
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,896
<i>be like, "Well, if Gabler's
going to do it,</i>

1233
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,827
then I'm not going to risk
my vote 'cause he's going in."

1234
00:52:57,689 --> 00:52:59,379
There we go.

1235
00:52:59,482 --> 00:53:00,931
We reveal our cards,
and it's shown that

1236
00:53:01,034 --> 00:53:02,551
<i>Karla did not risk her vote,</i>

1237
00:53:02,655 --> 00:53:04,206
<i>but Gabler and I did.</i>

1238
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:05,586
<i>So that means
Gabler and I have to now draw</i>

1239
00:53:05,689 --> 00:53:07,551
<i>from a bag
which contains an advantage</i>

1240
00:53:07,655 --> 00:53:10,379
<i>and a "lose your vote" card.
It's 50/50,</i>

1241
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:12,758
<i>which is terrifying.</i>

1242
00:53:12,862 --> 00:53:14,793
<i>If I lose my vote, I am screwed.</i>

1243
00:53:14,896 --> 00:53:16,862
You want to draw first,
or should I?

1244
00:53:16,965 --> 00:53:18,241
Let's go age before beauty.
How about that?

1245
00:53:18,344 --> 00:53:19,827
All righty. Good luck.

1246
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:22,965
<i>Dwight met my bluff,
and he doubled down,</i>

1247
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:25,344
<i>so now I can lose my vote.</i>

1248
00:53:25,448 --> 00:53:27,103
<i>But I'm 51, and</i>

1249
00:53:27,206 --> 00:53:29,517
there's only been one winner
over 50

1250
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,758
of <i>Survivor</i> in all the seasons,
so, yeah,

1251
00:53:31,862 --> 00:53:34,172
<i>I have to take risks,
and I'm going big.</i>

1252
00:53:34,275 --> 00:53:36,448
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1253
00:53:36,551 --> 00:53:37,896
Guess we'll find out.

1254
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,655
I guess we will.
It's going to be interesting,

1255
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,655
the next Tribal or not.
Like, "Oh, God."

1256
00:53:41,758 --> 00:53:44,310
<i>
I'm very happy with my decision.
I think</i>

1257
00:53:44,413 --> 00:53:47,034
I did the right thing
by trusting my gut

1258
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:49,586
<i>and not risking my vote.</i>

1259
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,172
- See you at the merge.
- Definitely see you
at the merge.

1260
00:53:51,275 --> 00:53:52,620
- Absolutely. <i>
- And Gabler was like,</i>

1261
00:53:52,724 --> 00:53:54,310
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll see
each other at the merge."

1262
00:53:54,413 --> 00:53:57,206
<i>But I don't know if that's going
to happen, given the fact that</i>

1263
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:00,965
one of them can't vote
and one of them is now a threat.

1264
00:54:16,931 --> 00:54:20,206
This is the one.
This is the one. Come on.

1265
00:54:26,275 --> 00:54:28,310
Blood, sweat and tears.

1266
00:54:28,413 --> 00:54:30,620
<i>We've kind of
just traded off shifts</i>

1267
00:54:30,724 --> 00:54:32,586
of everyone trying to

1268
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:33,965
<i>make fire.</i>

1269
00:54:34,068 --> 00:54:36,275
Oh, oh, oh.

1270
00:54:36,379 --> 00:54:38,103
All right,
add those twigs behind you.

1271
00:54:38,206 --> 00:54:40,068
<i>
But for me, when I put my mind
to something, I...</i>

1272
00:54:40,172 --> 00:54:42,137
I-I know I have
to do it, or else

1273
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:44,000
I'm not going to be able
to, like, sleep at night.

1274
00:54:47,586 --> 00:54:48,931
- Hey, girl.
- Keep going.

1275
00:54:49,034 --> 00:54:50,206
Sticks, sticks, sticks,
sticks, sticks, sticks!

1276
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,586
<i>
It was super satisfying</i>

1277
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:54,586
<i>being the one
to actually get fire,</i>

1278
00:54:54,689 --> 00:54:55,896
and it's also something
that I wanted

1279
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,586
to cross off
on my <i>Survivor</i> checklist.

1280
00:54:57,689 --> 00:54:59,103
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

1281
00:54:59,206 --> 00:55:00,931
Yes, queen! Great job.

1282
00:55:01,034 --> 00:55:02,413
Nice.

1283
00:55:02,517 --> 00:55:03,896
- Oh, Dwight is back.

1284
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,379
Dwight's back.

1285
00:55:07,931 --> 00:55:10,344
- Hey.
- Hey.

1286
00:55:10,448 --> 00:55:13,310
<i>Coming back
into camp, I'm thinking about</i>

1287
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:14,896
do I lie? Do I tell the truth?

1288
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,448
- Oh, God. Do we have a fire?

1289
00:55:16,551 --> 00:55:18,482
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

1290
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:20,379
<i>
We've all seen 41 and 42.</i>

1291
00:55:20,482 --> 00:55:22,241
<i>We know that advantages come
from these journeys.</i>

1292
00:55:22,344 --> 00:55:23,758
<i>So if I come back and say,</i>

1293
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:27,448
"Oh, it was nothing this time.
It was just a nice walk,"

1294
00:55:27,551 --> 00:55:29,206
<i>they're gonna put a target
of my back so quickly.</i>

1295
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:33,655
So it was an island.
It was me, Karla and Gabler.

1296
00:55:33,758 --> 00:55:36,137
We had to walk across...
Like, it was water up to here.

1297
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:38,793
So everything was wet.
We get there.

1298
00:55:38,896 --> 00:55:41,724
You can risk your vote
or not risk your vote.

1299
00:55:41,827 --> 00:55:44,413
For every person that risks,
you draw out of a bag.

1300
00:55:44,517 --> 00:55:46,206
Only one has an advantage.

1301
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,827
Oh, damn.

1302
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:49,379
And I don't know yet. I won't
figure out till later today

1303
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:51,172
what I got. So...

1304
00:55:53,379 --> 00:55:54,724
You're fine.

1305
00:55:56,275 --> 00:55:58,103
- Have at it.

1306
00:55:59,517 --> 00:56:01,344
<i>
I don't know if I trust
Dwight's story fully,</i>

1307
00:56:01,448 --> 00:56:03,379
<i>'cause he's like, "Oh, we went
in the water. It was this deep."</i>

1308
00:56:03,482 --> 00:56:04,896
<i>And then he's like,
"It's already dry." I'm like,</i>

1309
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,344
"There's no way it's dry
by the time you're back.

1310
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:09,206
You were only gone for
an hour and a half. Impossible."

1311
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:10,965
I didn't believe
any of that story.

1312
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:12,655
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1313
00:56:12,758 --> 00:56:14,172
He's got a lot going on
in his head.

1314
00:56:15,793 --> 00:56:17,689
<i>I think there's more to it.
This guy's here to play.</i>

1315
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:19,517
<i>Not out here
just to have a good time.</i>

1316
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,413
So it could be
detrimental to my game.

1317
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,862
<i>So, me
and, um, Dwight risked it.</i>

1318
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:38,275
- Oh.
- So it's like a toss-up.
- So it's 50/50

1319
00:56:38,379 --> 00:56:41,137
if you get...
if you win the advantage or not.

1320
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:42,517
So I don't know what it is yet,

1321
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,517
and I don't know if he got it,
but I'm gonna go.

1322
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,586
- So I'm gonna go walk off

1323
00:56:46,689 --> 00:56:49,137
and figure out what it is
and then I'll be back, okay?

1324
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,275
- And then you come back and let
us know whatever you want to.
- Come back. You got to.

1325
00:56:51,379 --> 00:56:53,344
- All you.
- Okay. Let's roll.

1326
00:56:53,448 --> 00:56:56,103
<i>I could lose my vote.
That would be devastating.</i>

1327
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:58,068
<i>But at the same time,
you know, if you get</i>

1328
00:56:58,172 --> 00:57:00,137
that opportunity to go
on a big journey like that,

1329
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:01,724
<i>you want to come home
with something.</i>

1330
00:57:01,827 --> 00:57:04,689
Let's see.
Did I outplay Dwight?

1331
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:07,517
Or did he outplay me?

1332
00:57:08,827 --> 00:57:09,862
Okay.

1333
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:12,551
"You risked and won."

1334
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,517
"You risked and lost.

1335
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,724
You cannot cast any votes
at your next Tribal Council."

1336
00:57:22,827 --> 00:57:24,793
Damn.

1337
00:57:32,655 --> 00:57:34,413
- Oh, my God!

1338
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:37,862
<i>
I have an idol for
my first two Tribal Councils.</i>

1339
00:57:37,965 --> 00:57:39,172
<i>Most people think
you get the idol,</i>

1340
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:42,344
you bury it,
you hide it, you lie about it.

1341
00:57:42,448 --> 00:57:44,517
- Yes!
- Oh, my God!

1342
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,758
<i>
But as you probably
can figure out by now,</i>

1343
00:57:46,862 --> 00:57:48,344
I go to the beat of my own drum.

1344
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:49,724
I'm-I'm so happy for you.

1345
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:50,827
They didn't get it.

1346
00:57:51,896 --> 00:57:54,034
Oh. Aw, man.

1347
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,724
You lost your vote?

1348
00:57:55,827 --> 00:57:57,379
And listen, we all know
Gabler has something now.

1349
00:57:57,482 --> 00:57:59,448
- So just be wary of Gabler.
- Yeah.

1350
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:03,068
<i>
By letting them see the idol,
it builds goodwill and trust.</i>

1351
00:58:03,172 --> 00:58:05,758
And trust is
the name of the game out here.

1352
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:07,344
Baka, Baka, Baka!

1353
00:58:31,517 --> 00:58:32,896
Come on in!

1354
00:58:36,448 --> 00:58:37,655
- Yes.
- Look at those smiles.

1355
00:58:37,758 --> 00:58:39,034
Oh, dang.

1356
00:58:39,137 --> 00:58:40,344
Awesome.

1357
00:58:40,448 --> 00:58:42,482
That's what we want to hear, Lindsay.

1358
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:47,862
This is a big, kick-ass
first immunity challenge.

1359
00:58:48,827 --> 00:58:50,034
Let's get it on.

1360
00:58:50,137 --> 00:58:52,310
I like the enthusiasm.

1361
00:58:59,965 --> 00:59:03,137
All right, let's get into
your first immunity challenge.

1362
00:59:05,034 --> 00:59:06,344
Yeah, baby!

1363
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,379
<i>For today's challenge,
you're gonna race</i>

1364
00:59:09,482 --> 00:59:11,482
<i>through a series of obstacles,
collecting three balls.</i>

1365
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:15,551
<i>One player will then
dig under a log...</i>

1366
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,172
<i>...and release a ramp.</i>

1367
00:59:20,172 --> 00:59:21,689
<i>You'll work together
to get everybody</i>

1368
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:24,310
<i>up the ramp
and across a balance beam.</i>

1369
00:59:24,413 --> 00:59:27,620
<i>As players cross the beam,
you can untie a handle</i>

1370
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:31,482
<i>that will open the beam wider
and make it easier.</i>

1371
00:59:31,586 --> 00:59:33,827
<i>The first tribe to get
all their players to the finish</i>

1372
00:59:33,931 --> 00:59:36,172
<i>gets their choice
between three table games.</i>

1373
00:59:36,275 --> 00:59:38,448
The second tribe picks
between the remaining two.

1374
00:59:38,551 --> 00:59:41,344
The last tribe gets what's left.

1375
00:59:41,448 --> 00:59:44,034
<i>Then two players
will work together to maneuver</i>

1376
00:59:44,137 --> 00:59:46,344
<i>three balls to the end
of their table game.</i>

1377
00:59:46,448 --> 00:59:50,241
The first two tribes to finish
win immunity,

1378
00:59:50,344 --> 00:59:52,827
- are safe from the vote.

1379
00:59:52,931 --> 00:59:54,551
These are the immunity idols.

1380
00:59:55,793 --> 00:59:56,965
Yeah!

1381
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,034
They're so beautiful.

1382
01:00:01,137 --> 01:00:02,724
With an immunity idol
at your camp,

1383
01:00:02,827 --> 01:00:04,689
it means
you're not going to Tribal.

1384
01:00:04,793 --> 01:00:06,103
It means you can't be voted out.

1385
01:00:06,206 --> 01:00:08,586
The last tribe to finish,
Tribal Council tonight,

1386
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:11,965
where somebody will be the first
person voted out of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

1387
01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:15,241
And as a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint.

1388
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:17,517
All right, I'm gonna give you
a minute to strategize.

1389
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,931
We'll get it on.

1390
01:00:26,586 --> 01:00:28,206
All right, here we go.

1391
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,103
For immunity. Survivors ready?

1392
01:00:35,862 --> 01:00:36,758
Go!

1393
01:00:36,862 --> 01:00:38,379
You got to get through that mud.

1394
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:39,862
This is your awakening.

1395
01:00:39,965 --> 01:00:41,379
It's happening.

1396
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:45,103
You're not at home anymore.

1397
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:46,448
You're on <i>Survivor!</i>

1398
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:47,551
Here we go, guys.

1399
01:00:54,034 --> 01:00:56,344
Everybody's got to
get through that mud.

1400
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:57,827
Yeah!

1401
01:00:57,931 --> 01:01:00,724
Got to get all six people
to your mat.

1402
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:04,862
Go, go, go, go, go.

1403
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:06,586
You got it. You got it, Nneka.

1404
01:01:07,689 --> 01:01:08,793
Baka, you're good.

1405
01:01:09,827 --> 01:01:11,103
Go, go. Go, go.

1406
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:12,896
Coco, you're good.

1407
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:18,103
Vesi, let's go.
Got to get everybody through.

1408
01:01:19,103 --> 01:01:20,862
You're good.

1409
01:01:20,965 --> 01:01:23,379
Now you're untying
your three balls

1410
01:01:23,482 --> 01:01:25,068
that you need
for that table game.

1411
01:01:25,172 --> 01:01:26,827
They're attached to the post.

1412
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,068
Come on, come on!

1413
01:01:29,172 --> 01:01:30,793
- Go!
- Baka, you're good.

1414
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,103
- Go, go, go!

1415
01:01:32,206 --> 01:01:33,172
Yep, yep, yep.

1416
01:01:33,275 --> 01:01:34,896
Vesi, you're good.

1417
01:01:36,379 --> 01:01:38,068
Okay, we got it.

1418
01:01:38,172 --> 01:01:39,862
Coco, you're good.

1419
01:01:39,965 --> 01:01:41,310
We're dead even right now.

1420
01:01:41,413 --> 01:01:43,448
All three tribes in this.

1421
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:47,172
You've got to dig a hole
that is deep enough

1422
01:01:47,275 --> 01:01:50,206
for your entire body
to get under the log

1423
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:52,034
and through to the other side.

1424
01:01:52,137 --> 01:01:53,517
- Let's go, Ryan, you got this.
- This is not easy.

1425
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,689
Ryan is going for it.

1426
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:58,034
Let's go, Ryan! Let's go!

1427
01:01:58,137 --> 01:01:59,896
- Can he get through?

1428
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,344
You got this! Yes!

1429
01:02:01,448 --> 01:02:02,344
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!

1430
01:02:02,448 --> 01:02:04,241
Ryan's through for Coco!

1431
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:06,793
All right, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1432
01:02:07,965 --> 01:02:09,586
Coco, now trying
to get to the top.

1433
01:02:09,689 --> 01:02:10,724
All right.

1434
01:02:12,413 --> 01:02:15,724
Lindsay on her own. Wow!

1435
01:02:15,827 --> 01:02:18,517
Nice work.
James is providing that ladder.

1436
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,862
Let's go, baby!

1437
01:02:19,965 --> 01:02:21,172
Come on, step on my shoulders!

1438
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:22,689
Lindsay trying to pull Ryan up.

1439
01:02:22,793 --> 01:02:23,689
He's up!

1440
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,103
Cody's through!

1441
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:29,862
Jeanine, completely buried
under the pole,

1442
01:02:29,965 --> 01:02:32,172
trying to get
back out to dig again.

1443
01:02:34,448 --> 01:02:35,931
You're good, Vesi.

1444
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:38,896
Pull. Climb it up.
Climb it up.

1445
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:47,275
James still trying to get up.

1446
01:02:47,379 --> 01:02:49,482
Ryan gonna come down
and try to help him.

1447
01:02:49,586 --> 01:02:52,172
This is what
it takes on <i>Survivor.</i>

1448
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:54,551
You have to assess
the situation and adapt,

1449
01:02:54,655 --> 01:02:55,931
and you're doing it.

1450
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:57,862
James is almost up.

1451
01:02:57,965 --> 01:02:59,241
They've got him!

1452
01:02:59,344 --> 01:03:02,586
Now can Ryan get up again?
He's done it once.

1453
01:03:04,965 --> 01:03:07,655
- Coco, they've got it.

1454
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:10,689
Start across the beam.

1455
01:03:10,793 --> 01:03:12,310
Come on, Jeanine!

1456
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,034
Come on, Jeanine, dig!

1457
01:03:14,137 --> 01:03:16,206
- Almost there, y'all!
Let's go!
- Go, go, go.

1458
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:18,827
Vesi's still working to get up.

1459
01:03:23,586 --> 01:03:25,172
Here goes Ryan.

1460
01:03:25,275 --> 01:03:27,137
Take your time.

1461
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:28,379
- All right, go.
- Yeah, Ryan!

1462
01:03:28,482 --> 01:03:30,448
You can start untying that pole.

1463
01:03:30,551 --> 01:03:32,379
Once Ryan has the knots undone,

1464
01:03:32,482 --> 01:03:36,034
you can open that beam wide
and everybody will race across.

1465
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:38,068
Lindsay's across.

1466
01:03:38,172 --> 01:03:39,241
Keep pushing, girl.

1467
01:03:39,344 --> 01:03:40,655
- Here we go!

1468
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:42,724
Thataway, Jeanine!
Jeanine is through.

1469
01:03:42,827 --> 01:03:46,862
- Jeanine now trying
to chop the rope.

1470
01:03:46,965 --> 01:03:48,827
- Jeanine's got it!

1471
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:52,344
Baka, you're good.
Start working on the wall.

1472
01:03:52,448 --> 01:03:54,068
- Gabler, Gabler...

1473
01:03:54,172 --> 01:03:55,137
Let's go.

1474
01:03:55,241 --> 01:03:56,172
- Now you got it!

1475
01:03:56,275 --> 01:03:57,689
Let's go!

1476
01:03:57,793 --> 01:03:58,689
Come on!

1477
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:01,000
That's how you do it.

1478
01:04:02,689 --> 01:04:04,413
Coco releases their pole.

1479
01:04:05,448 --> 01:04:06,517
Everybody now can cross.

1480
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,379
Slide down, slide down.

1481
01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:09,379
Run, run, run.

1482
01:04:09,482 --> 01:04:10,758
Slide down now.

1483
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Go.

1484
01:04:16,172 --> 01:04:17,620
Okay, let's choose one.

1485
01:04:17,724 --> 01:04:19,517
- All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Before we do...

1486
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,448
Coco now has made
their selection.

1487
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,862
They've taken the maze.

1488
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:26,724
Table game number three.

1489
01:04:27,724 --> 01:04:29,517
- Baka trying to get
everybody up.
- Got you.

1490
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,586
They've got one person left.

1491
01:04:31,689 --> 01:04:33,172
- Yes!
- Morriah, get ready. Morriah...

1492
01:04:33,275 --> 01:04:36,172
And he's up. You're good.
Start on the beam.

1493
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,896
You're good. Great job, girl.

1494
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,931
Good job, girl. That's awesome.

1495
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:45,551
We've got Coco in the lead,
working on their table game.

1496
01:04:45,655 --> 01:04:47,827
- Let it go. You're good!

1497
01:04:47,931 --> 01:04:48,965
You got it.

1498
01:04:49,965 --> 01:04:51,655
Vesi heading across now.

1499
01:04:51,758 --> 01:04:53,379
Here goes Morriah.

1500
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,655
Wow. Nice touch by Morriah.

1501
01:04:56,758 --> 01:04:58,827
- That is how you do it!

1502
01:04:58,931 --> 01:05:00,517
Great job, Morriah.

1503
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,827
- Here goes Sami.
- Look forward, and...

1504
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:09,931
Vesi have to choose now
between one and two.

1505
01:05:10,034 --> 01:05:12,344
They're gonna take number two,
the straight shot.

1506
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:14,413
All right, guys, we got this.

1507
01:05:14,517 --> 01:05:16,137
There you go!

1508
01:05:17,172 --> 01:05:18,068
Up, up.

1509
01:05:19,793 --> 01:05:22,620
It is Ryan and Lindsay
doing a really nice job.

1510
01:05:23,655 --> 01:05:26,068
They are very close to
that first ball, but it drops.

1511
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,448
- It's a learning curve.
- Sorry.

1512
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,517
- Here comes Baka.

1513
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:31,103
Coco got here first.

1514
01:05:31,206 --> 01:05:33,172
They chose the maze.

1515
01:05:33,275 --> 01:05:35,241
Vesi got here second.

1516
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:37,827
They chose the straight shot.

1517
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:39,655
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three, go!

1518
01:05:39,758 --> 01:05:42,448
Baka got here last, and they
were left with the obstacle.

1519
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:46,103
The question is,
were these the right choices?

1520
01:05:46,206 --> 01:05:48,551
Drop back our way.
Drop back our way.

1521
01:05:48,655 --> 01:05:50,379
Oh.

1522
01:05:50,482 --> 01:05:53,206
- Coco lands
their first ball. Two left.

1523
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,310
Jesse and Noelle.

1524
01:05:55,413 --> 01:05:56,965
They chose straight shot.

1525
01:05:57,068 --> 01:05:58,689
Some would say
this is a more difficult,

1526
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:01,172
but they've got a nice touch.

1527
01:06:01,275 --> 01:06:03,310
Almost drop it out of the gate.

1528
01:06:03,413 --> 01:06:04,931
- Pull it back. Wait...
- Good job, brother.

1529
01:06:05,034 --> 01:06:06,862
- Little bit.
- There we go.

1530
01:06:06,965 --> 01:06:08,068
- So flatten her out.

1531
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,724
Okay. That's okay.
We're learning.

1532
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:14,827
Once again, Ryan and Lindsay,
very, very close.

1533
01:06:14,931 --> 01:06:16,482
- And they've got it.
- Got it.

1534
01:06:16,586 --> 01:06:18,551
Coco has two.
Down to their last ball.

1535
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:20,655
- Jesse and Noelle
gonna give it another shot.
- Slow it up, slow it up.

1536
01:06:20,758 --> 01:06:24,275
- Yes.
- In and out for Vesi.

1537
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:28,275
- Nice maneuvering
by Gabler and Sami.
- Nice. Nice, nice, nice.

1538
01:06:28,379 --> 01:06:30,931
- You got it. Yes...
- They're at
the three-quarter spot now.

1539
01:06:31,034 --> 01:06:32,275
- Yes, we do.
- Yes.

1540
01:06:32,379 --> 01:06:33,448
- Gabler and Sami.

1541
01:06:34,482 --> 01:06:36,827
- Drops in the gutter again.

1542
01:06:36,931 --> 01:06:38,241
Bro, bro, I'm trying.

1543
01:06:38,344 --> 01:06:39,620
I know. It's hard. I know.

1544
01:06:39,724 --> 01:06:41,517
- Okay, slowly. Okay, ready?
- Okay.

1545
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,344
Coco very close
to their third and final ball.

1546
01:06:45,344 --> 01:06:47,517
- Coco wins immunity!

1547
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,620
Safe from Tribal Council.
Nobody going home.

1548
01:06:52,793 --> 01:06:54,206
We're looking for one more.

1549
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,448
Somebody will be voted out
of this game tonight.

1550
01:06:57,551 --> 01:07:00,103
Sami and Gabler,
as close as they've ever been

1551
01:07:00,206 --> 01:07:02,137
- to landing their first ball.
- You're taking the shot.

1552
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:03,965
They're close.

1553
01:07:04,068 --> 01:07:07,965
- They're in, they're out.
They're around, and they drop.
- Oh, man.

1554
01:07:08,068 --> 01:07:09,931
- You are so close...

1555
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:11,137
I need your help right there.

1556
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:13,068
Bro, I know.
I was, I was helping you.

1557
01:07:13,172 --> 01:07:14,793
- I was...
Trust me, I'm helping you.
- You hold that.

1558
01:07:14,896 --> 01:07:17,172
- You want me to go,
like, right here?
- Yep.

1559
01:07:17,275 --> 01:07:18,827
Let's try this.

1560
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:25,965
Ooh, a new strategy.

1561
01:07:29,689 --> 01:07:32,034
- That's in.
Vesi has their first ball.
- Yes!

1562
01:07:32,137 --> 01:07:33,862
Now they know they can do it.

1563
01:07:33,965 --> 01:07:36,241
- And that is
a lot of this challenge.
- Yes, that's it, yes.

1564
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,862
Believing that you can do it.

1565
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:41,482
- Down, down, down.
- Wow. Wow!

1566
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:46,448
Amazing. Straight down the track
and right in the hole.

1567
01:07:46,551 --> 01:07:48,103
Vesi lands their second ball.

1568
01:07:48,206 --> 01:07:51,206
Sami and Gabler cannot panic,
but they're in trouble.

1569
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:53,827
- Gabler, stop. Gabler, stop.
Gabler, stop.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1570
01:07:53,931 --> 01:07:55,310
- Okay. Barely touching.
- Okay.

1571
01:07:56,482 --> 01:07:57,482
Let's do it.

1572
01:08:00,137 --> 01:08:01,379
You're fighting me.

1573
01:08:01,482 --> 01:08:02,655
I'm not fighting you, dude.

1574
01:08:02,758 --> 01:08:04,137
I'm barely
putting any effort on this.

1575
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:06,068
Vesi can close it out
right here.

1576
01:08:06,172 --> 01:08:07,448
Vesi down the track.

1577
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,172
It's Jesse and Noelle
for the win.

1578
01:08:09,275 --> 01:08:10,931
Slowly.

1579
01:08:11,034 --> 01:08:13,517
- And that's good!
Vesi pulls it out!

1580
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:15,172
- Let's go!
- Immunity for Vesi.

1581
01:08:15,275 --> 01:08:18,172
- Sending Baka to Tribal Council.
- Let's go!

1582
01:08:18,275 --> 01:08:22,413
Where somebody will be the first
person voted out of this game.

1583
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,724
All right.

1584
01:08:29,827 --> 01:08:32,620
First place, Coco.

1585
01:08:32,724 --> 01:08:34,862
- A dominating performance.

1586
01:08:34,965 --> 01:08:36,517
You are all safe.

1587
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,206
- Nobody going home tonight. Congrats.

1588
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:40,103
- Yeah!

1589
01:08:41,965 --> 01:08:43,517
Mwah.

1590
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,068
Equally hard fought
the entire way.

1591
01:08:45,172 --> 01:08:46,896
Vesi, congratulations.

1592
01:08:49,137 --> 01:08:51,586
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Yes!

1593
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:53,758
Coco, Vesi, nobody going home.

1594
01:08:53,862 --> 01:08:55,344
- Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.
- Yes.

1595
01:08:55,448 --> 01:08:57,137
- Congrats.
- We can go?

1596
01:08:57,241 --> 01:08:58,655
- We can go?
- All right.

1597
01:08:58,758 --> 01:09:02,103
All right, Baka. So let's talk.

1598
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:03,896
Gabler,
what's the feeling right now,

1599
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,586
knowing Tribal Council
is just a few hours away?

1600
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:09,793
- Jeff, honestly,
we haven't thought about it.

1601
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,413
We thought about winning
since-since we got here.

1602
01:09:11,517 --> 01:09:14,379
And I'll tell you this,
we all gave it all.

1603
01:09:14,482 --> 01:09:16,965
We were communicating.
We never lost heart.

1604
01:09:17,068 --> 01:09:18,172
We never lost friendship.

1605
01:09:18,275 --> 01:09:19,517
- That's right.

1606
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:23,689
That's it. I mean, it's just...
it's hard.

1607
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:26,931
- All right,
the result is, Baka, dead last.

1608
01:09:27,034 --> 01:09:29,413
As a penalty for losing,
I'll be taking your flint.

1609
01:09:29,517 --> 01:09:31,068
Sorry for you.

1610
01:09:32,103 --> 01:09:33,517
Sorry for us.

1611
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:34,793
You'll have a chance
to earn it back

1612
01:09:34,896 --> 01:09:36,379
at your next immunity challenge.

1613
01:09:36,482 --> 01:09:39,068
All right, Tribal Council
tonight, where somebody will be

1614
01:09:39,172 --> 01:09:41,413
the first person voted out
of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

1615
01:09:41,517 --> 01:09:42,862
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

1616
01:09:42,965 --> 01:09:44,551
See you tonight at Tribal.

1617
01:09:44,655 --> 01:09:46,137
- Group hug.

1618
01:09:47,241 --> 01:09:49,344
Let's go.

1619
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:51,103
<i>
Losing sucks. It's sad.</i>

1620
01:09:51,206 --> 01:09:55,827
With that being said, I think
that with the loss today,

1621
01:09:55,931 --> 01:09:57,551
our game really starts.

1622
01:09:57,655 --> 01:10:00,137
<i>I mean, we didn't talk
any strategy at all,</i>

1623
01:10:00,241 --> 01:10:01,724
<i>not for one second.</i>

1624
01:10:01,827 --> 01:10:05,172
<i>And this is no longer
some kumbaya camping trip.</i>

1625
01:10:05,275 --> 01:10:07,896
<i>It's about to get
really crazy very shortly.</i>

1626
01:10:21,206 --> 01:10:23,206
<i>
We lost the challenge.</i>

1627
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:24,655
<i>It was excruciating.</i>

1628
01:10:24,758 --> 01:10:27,793
In the sun, everyone's watching.
Jeff's in your ear.

1629
01:10:27,896 --> 01:10:31,862
<i>It's about the most intense
thing I can think of,</i>

1630
01:10:31,965 --> 01:10:34,413
and I work in the operating
room with heart surgeries.

1631
01:10:36,206 --> 01:10:37,655
<i>We have to go to Tribal Council,</i>

1632
01:10:37,758 --> 01:10:40,172
<i>and we're gonna have
to lose somebody tonight.</i>

1633
01:10:41,413 --> 01:10:42,655
- Okay.
- How is everybody?

1634
01:10:42,758 --> 01:10:44,655
We busted our ass.
We did our best.

1635
01:10:44,758 --> 01:10:45,896
I'm so proud of everybody.

1636
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,413
<i>
I take accountability for that.</i>

1637
01:10:47,517 --> 01:10:49,551
<i>I was part of the loss,</i>

1638
01:10:49,655 --> 01:10:52,448
so I should be
a potential target tonight.

1639
01:10:52,551 --> 01:10:54,586
So, a couple things here.

1640
01:10:54,689 --> 01:10:57,586
Number one, I came out here
with three goals.

1641
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:02,586
And one was to learn
about myself through hardship.

1642
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:06,379
Secondly, I came out here
to play a great game,

1643
01:11:06,482 --> 01:11:10,034
which t-to date, we all
have played an amazing game.

1644
01:11:10,137 --> 01:11:13,137
And lastly, I wanted to win
an immunity idol, which I-I did.

1645
01:11:13,241 --> 01:11:15,379
So that's freaking huge.
It's amazing.

1646
01:11:15,482 --> 01:11:19,448
Being that said, I'm not gonna
hide behind my immunity idol.

1647
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,965
I don't want
to take the easy road out.

1648
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:23,275
So tonight, I'm gonna take
a Shot in the Dark.

1649
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,172
I'm gonna roll it.

1650
01:11:25,275 --> 01:11:26,448
I'm gonna throw
the Shot in the Dark,

1651
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:28,000
and we're just gonna
see where it's at.

1652
01:11:28,103 --> 01:11:31,068
Everybody at home is gonna have
a hard time understanding

1653
01:11:31,172 --> 01:11:34,275
why I wouldn't automatically
play my immunity idol.

1654
01:11:34,379 --> 01:11:36,586
<i>But I was part of the loss,</i>

1655
01:11:36,689 --> 01:11:39,413
<i>and therefore I'll be playing
my Shot in the Dark,</i>

1656
01:11:39,517 --> 01:11:41,758
because I should be
at risk tonight.

1657
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:43,034
Cool?

1658
01:11:45,103 --> 01:11:47,103
<i>
The shock was written
all over my face and body.</i>

1659
01:11:47,206 --> 01:11:49,241
Just... what?

1660
01:11:49,344 --> 01:11:51,068
Like, what are you doing
right now?

1661
01:11:51,172 --> 01:11:52,413
- Dude, we still got,
we still got...
- I know.

1662
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:53,689
I-I know...

1663
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:56,896
We need to look at our fire.

1664
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,827
We just lost our flint. I think
we'll all want to scramble.

1665
01:11:58,931 --> 01:12:00,517
- Let's focus on that
first. Yeah.
- We'll all want to talk

1666
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:03,551
to each other. Like, let's just
see if there's something there.

1667
01:12:03,655 --> 01:12:05,551
- Okay. <i>
- You only play
the Shot in the Dark,</i>

1668
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:08,034
<i>you only choose
to lose your vote</i>

1669
01:12:08,137 --> 01:12:11,241
for a one-in-six chance
if you think you're going home.

1670
01:12:11,344 --> 01:12:13,241
- We need to get some kindling.
- I'm gonna go
run and grab some.

1671
01:12:13,344 --> 01:12:15,448
- Okay. <i>
- I'm not interested
in voting out Gabler,</i>

1672
01:12:15,551 --> 01:12:16,965
especially not this early.

1673
01:12:17,068 --> 01:12:19,172
- Hey, we're not voting you.
- Okay.

1674
01:12:19,275 --> 01:12:20,655
<i>
Gabler works really,
really hard.</i>

1675
01:12:20,758 --> 01:12:22,965
<i>He's constantly
helping out around camp.</i>

1676
01:12:23,068 --> 01:12:24,517
<i>And I think
that we need workhorses.</i>

1677
01:12:26,103 --> 01:12:27,103
Okay.

1678
01:12:28,689 --> 01:12:30,137
Okay, but don't...

1679
01:12:30,241 --> 01:12:32,482
My skill as a therapist
is to talk people out of things,

1680
01:12:32,586 --> 01:12:34,344
to talk people off of a ledge, essentially.

1681
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:43,862
<i>Unfortunately for Morriah,
in a tribe of six,</i>

1682
01:12:43,965 --> 01:12:46,275
strength and challenge
performance is really important.

1683
01:12:46,379 --> 01:12:47,758
Oh, yeah, keep blowing
like that.

1684
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:49,275
<i>This tribe
was living in a fantasy world.</i>

1685
01:12:49,379 --> 01:12:51,758
We were all like, "Oh,
my gosh, we're on <i>Survivor.</i>

1686
01:12:51,862 --> 01:12:53,310
This is so fun.
I love you. I love you."

1687
01:12:53,413 --> 01:12:56,931
<i>And now, strategically,
that lackadaisical attitude</i>

1688
01:12:57,034 --> 01:13:01,379
has definitely translated to now
a mad, mad dash right now.

1689
01:13:01,482 --> 01:13:02,482
All right...

1690
01:13:17,275 --> 01:13:18,275
Yeah.

1691
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:21,379
And she is strong,
and I feel bad.

1692
01:13:22,379 --> 01:13:23,896
I feel very bad.

1693
01:13:28,758 --> 01:13:30,379
I definitely don't want it
to be me or you.

1694
01:13:30,482 --> 01:13:32,793
- No, yeah, I'm good with you.
- I-I, like, I'm serious.

1695
01:13:32,896 --> 01:13:34,137
- Like, look me in my eyes.
- We're good.

1696
01:13:34,241 --> 01:13:36,448
Like, I, like, Sami.
Like, seriously.

1697
01:13:36,551 --> 01:13:38,517
No, yeah, we're good. I-I
wasn't even thinking about you.

1698
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:41,655
Like, not even once.
I do like Elie a lot.

1699
01:13:41,758 --> 01:13:43,620
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- And I like Jeanine a lot.

1700
01:13:43,724 --> 01:13:46,034
'Cause in a perfect world,
we're all on the same page,

1701
01:13:46,137 --> 01:13:47,413
except for who's going home.

1702
01:13:47,517 --> 01:13:50,068
I guess if I was to say
who I haven't talked to.

1703
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:52,689
- Yeah.
- Probably Owen
the least out of anybody.

1704
01:13:52,793 --> 01:13:54,103
- Like...
- Okay.

1705
01:13:54,206 --> 01:13:56,482
<i>We're no longer a kumbaya tribe,</i>

1706
01:13:56,586 --> 01:13:59,896
<i>but I have my girls,
and I really vibe with Sami.</i>

1707
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,655
And that leaves on the outs
Gabler and Owen.

1708
01:14:04,655 --> 01:14:06,172
Yeah.

1709
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,482
<i>
For me,
it's just too much of a risk</i>

1710
01:14:08,586 --> 01:14:10,206
to vote out Gabler.

1711
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:11,931
Not only does he have an idol,

1712
01:14:12,034 --> 01:14:14,482
<i>but now he's talking about
playing his Shot in the Dark.</i>

1713
01:14:14,586 --> 01:14:16,068
<i>That's two different
opportunities</i>

1714
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:17,586
<i>for him to save himself.</i>

1715
01:14:17,689 --> 01:14:19,000
Gabler's not playing his Shot
in the Dark. We were just

1716
01:14:19,103 --> 01:14:20,448
- kind of chatting that.
- I don't b...

1717
01:14:20,551 --> 01:14:21,931
- I don't know. I don't know.
- We don't think so.

1718
01:14:22,034 --> 01:14:23,000
So, not Gabler.

1719
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,551
- Okay.
- What were you thinking?

1720
01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:28,275
Oh.

1721
01:14:28,379 --> 01:14:29,517
So, Owen.

1722
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:30,862
<i>
Me and Owen</i>

1723
01:14:30,965 --> 01:14:32,344
<i>haven't really
been talking very much.</i>

1724
01:14:32,448 --> 01:14:34,655
<i>And I think he's a lot smarter
than he seems,</i>

1725
01:14:34,758 --> 01:14:35,965
which scares me about him.

1726
01:14:36,068 --> 01:14:37,379
<i>Owen is the kind of player that,</i>

1727
01:14:37,482 --> 01:14:39,068
<i>down the line,
when we get down to it,</i>

1728
01:14:39,172 --> 01:14:40,758
<i>I'm going to end up seeing</i>

1729
01:14:40,862 --> 01:14:42,068
just how dangerous
Owen could be.

1730
01:14:44,206 --> 01:14:45,655
- That's true.
- All right.

1731
01:14:45,758 --> 01:14:47,068
- So, Owen?
- That's the clearest way.

1732
01:14:47,172 --> 01:14:48,379
<i>
Morriah came up with a plan,</i>

1733
01:14:48,482 --> 01:14:49,758
<i>and I came up with a plan,</i>

1734
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:51,413
<i>and she doesn't know that</i>

1735
01:14:51,517 --> 01:14:52,827
<i>my plan is against hers.</i>

1736
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:54,068
<i>I'm not interested
in voting out Owen.</i>

1737
01:14:54,172 --> 01:14:55,482
<i>I want</i>

1738
01:14:55,586 --> 01:14:57,034
to prioritize strength
right now.

1739
01:14:58,068 --> 01:14:59,482
Sorry.

1740
01:14:59,586 --> 01:15:02,655
The three of us and Sami--
we're writing...

1741
01:15:06,275 --> 01:15:07,862
- I just wanted
to triple-fy check.
- Yeah.

1742
01:15:07,965 --> 01:15:10,000
The three of us plus Sami
is going to write Owen.

1743
01:15:10,103 --> 01:15:11,517
Okay.

1744
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:12,896
The three of us
sticking together--

1745
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,241
- if we lose again...
- Yeah.

1746
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,034
- we have three women
over two now.
- Yeah.

1747
01:15:19,517 --> 01:15:21,275
It's like the smartest plan
for the three of us.

1748
01:15:21,379 --> 01:15:24,034
<i>Elie wants
to vote Morriah out because</i>

1749
01:15:24,137 --> 01:15:26,793
<i>she's just the weakest member
of our tribe, but</i>

1750
01:15:26,896 --> 01:15:28,724
<i>my mind is working right now,
and</i>

1751
01:15:28,827 --> 01:15:32,103
I'm worried about how that will
go in the future in terms of...

1752
01:15:32,206 --> 01:15:34,620
<i>It makes it pretty easy
for the majority of three guys</i>

1753
01:15:34,724 --> 01:15:38,000
<i>now to work together
to vote out the women.</i>

1754
01:15:38,103 --> 01:15:40,103
And that's why I'm, like,
really stressed right now.

1755
01:15:48,103 --> 01:15:50,448
'Cause I don't want to be,
like, us versus boys.

1756
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:52,310
<i>
I understand Jeanine's fears.</i>

1757
01:15:52,413 --> 01:15:54,344
<i>So now I'm weighing out</i>

1758
01:15:54,448 --> 01:15:56,551
options of a vote

1759
01:15:56,655 --> 01:15:58,137
<i>for Owen</i>

1760
01:15:58,241 --> 01:16:00,413
<i>or voting out Morriah.</i>

1761
01:16:00,517 --> 01:16:02,344
<i>I really want us to move forward</i>

1762
01:16:02,448 --> 01:16:03,551
more physically strong.

1763
01:16:03,655 --> 01:16:07,206
<i>Morriah is not the strongest</i>

1764
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:10,586
<i>physical competitor
amongst our tribe, but</i>

1765
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:13,000
<i>I know that she wants to stick
with me and Jeanine.</i>

1766
01:16:13,103 --> 01:16:14,344
Sorry.

1767
01:16:14,448 --> 01:16:15,448
<i>
The downside to keeping Owen</i>

1768
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:17,482
<i>is that he could be trouble</i>

1769
01:16:17,586 --> 01:16:19,103
<i>down the line.</i>

1770
01:16:19,206 --> 01:16:20,275
I have to take
into consideration

1771
01:16:20,379 --> 01:16:21,517
<i>the relationship</i>

1772
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,724
<i>between the three guys.</i>

1773
01:16:22,827 --> 01:16:24,137
<i>I could be setting</i>

1774
01:16:24,241 --> 01:16:25,586
something in motion

1775
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:27,206
<i>Where they could have
an easy majority.</i>

1776
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:29,827
<i>The first vote is huge,</i>

1777
01:16:29,931 --> 01:16:32,413
<i>and Jeanine and I hold
all of the power</i>

1778
01:16:32,517 --> 01:16:35,275
<i>to decide who goes home.</i>

1779
01:17:28,689 --> 01:17:31,448
Behind you is a torch.
Everybody grab a torch,

1780
01:17:31,551 --> 01:17:34,620
dip it in, get fire.

1781
01:17:43,586 --> 01:17:45,620
This is part of the ritual

1782
01:17:45,724 --> 01:17:48,206
of Tribal Council because,
as you know,

1783
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:50,689
in this game
fire represents your life.

1784
01:17:50,793 --> 01:17:53,655
And when your fire is gone,
Owen, what happens?

1785
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:55,689
- So are you.
- Yeah.

1786
01:17:55,793 --> 01:17:56,793
Always breaks my heart.

1787
01:17:56,896 --> 01:17:58,206
All right,

1788
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:01,793
so, Sami, let's talk
about the first few days.

1789
01:18:01,896 --> 01:18:04,275
What is life like back at camp?

1790
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:06,965
Life has been, like, a joy.

1791
01:18:07,068 --> 01:18:09,689
We were all harmonious.
It was all just like

1792
01:18:09,793 --> 01:18:11,689
a kumbaya group thing.

1793
01:18:11,793 --> 01:18:14,827
- We are final six, honestly.

1794
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:18,379
I'm stunned
by what Sami just said.

1795
01:18:18,482 --> 01:18:20,689
To come out into this game

1796
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:22,724
and to actually believe
you're the final six,

1797
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:25,034
"We don't need to think
about Tribal, we're going

1798
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:27,172
to be fine," blows my mind.

1799
01:18:27,275 --> 01:18:31,275
Owen, did you share
that unbridled we-got-this based

1800
01:18:31,379 --> 01:18:33,724
- on absolutely nothing?
- Yeah. Well, like

1801
01:18:33,827 --> 01:18:35,137
Sami was saying,
like, we've gotten

1802
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:36,689
to know each other,
shared our stories.

1803
01:18:36,793 --> 01:18:39,827
But in terms of the gameplay,
yeah, no one wanted

1804
01:18:39,931 --> 01:18:42,000
to put a target on themselves
by being that person

1805
01:18:42,103 --> 01:18:43,965
that is a little too antsy
to, like, rush in

1806
01:18:44,068 --> 01:18:47,000
and throw someone under the bus.

1807
01:18:47,103 --> 01:18:48,793
Gabler, the obvious downside is,
you wait

1808
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:51,551
so late that people don't have
much time to make a case

1809
01:18:51,655 --> 01:18:54,172
to keep themselves
or even know it's them.

1810
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:56,620
So it's just as vicious.

1811
01:18:56,724 --> 01:18:58,275
- Oh, yeah.
- Just in a different way.

1812
01:18:58,379 --> 01:19:00,310
But I think
that's all the more reason why

1813
01:19:00,413 --> 01:19:03,965
it was important to get
to know everybody early

1814
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:06,517
because you never know how
the game is going to shake up.

1815
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,103
I mean, we were supposed
to win today.

1816
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:11,551
- We really...
We-we gave our all.
- Supposed to win?

1817
01:19:11,655 --> 01:19:13,137
I just can't figure it out.

1818
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:15,310
- I know.
- Based on what?

1819
01:19:15,413 --> 01:19:17,586
Well, I just want to say
that we did win today.

1820
01:19:17,689 --> 01:19:19,413
We didn't win
the immunity challenge 'cause,

1821
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:20,793
- clearly, we're sitting in
this beautiful Tribal Council.
- Yeah.

1822
01:19:20,896 --> 01:19:22,344
Let me just take this in, Morriah.

1823
01:19:22,448 --> 01:19:24,931
- MORRIAH [laughs]: Wait.
- You won today because?

1824
01:19:25,034 --> 01:19:26,517
We won because

1825
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,000
none of us gave up
and we all tried our best.

1826
01:19:28,103 --> 01:19:29,379
- Yeah.
- And that's what it's about.

1827
01:19:29,482 --> 01:19:31,241
You're not always going
to win the game,

1828
01:19:31,344 --> 01:19:34,241
but when you walk away
knowing that you gave it

1829
01:19:34,344 --> 01:19:35,827
- every single last thing...
- Everything.

1830
01:19:35,931 --> 01:19:38,413
that you had in the tank,
then you won.

1831
01:19:38,517 --> 01:19:41,379
But at the same time,
moral victories

1832
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,931
- mean nothing
at immunity challenges.
- Right.

1833
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:46,689
We're going to be here
every single time if we look

1834
01:19:46,793 --> 01:19:49,137
- at moral victories
as a real win in the books.
- Yeah.

1835
01:19:49,241 --> 01:19:50,586
- Mm-hmm.
- I agree.

1836
01:19:50,689 --> 01:19:52,034
- That's right.
- Yeah.
- I have... I have enough

1837
01:19:52,137 --> 01:19:53,482
- moral victories
in my personal life...
- Yeah.

1838
01:19:53,586 --> 01:19:56,137
with the teams I root for,
so in <i>Survivor,</i>

1839
01:19:56,241 --> 01:19:57,551
it's not as attractive.

1840
01:19:57,655 --> 01:19:59,103
You want to... you want to win
at whatever cost.

1841
01:19:59,206 --> 01:20:00,103
We really wanted
to win this one.

1842
01:20:00,206 --> 01:20:01,275
Losing with dignity's great.

1843
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:02,344
Like, we all had
our heads held high,

1844
01:20:02,448 --> 01:20:03,862
but it still sucks.

1845
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:07,241
So, if everybody feels good
about the effort today,

1846
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,551
does that mean
there was no finger-pointing?

1847
01:20:09,655 --> 01:20:12,482
Because Gabler and Sami-- you
two picked the finishing spot...

1848
01:20:12,586 --> 01:20:14,310
- Yeah.
- and couldn't get it done.

1849
01:20:14,413 --> 01:20:15,965
Did anybody come back and say,

1850
01:20:16,068 --> 01:20:17,482
"Maybe we should look
at these two"?

1851
01:20:17,586 --> 01:20:19,620
For sure, Jeff.
I mean, there is accountability.

1852
01:20:19,724 --> 01:20:21,620
You know, you feel bad
for letting people down.

1853
01:20:21,724 --> 01:20:22,931
You know, you want
to be the-the hero.

1854
01:20:23,034 --> 01:20:24,482
You want to...
you want to pull it out.

1855
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:25,896
You know, but is it possible

1856
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,896
that I'd have a target on me
for that? Yes.

1857
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,896
But pinning everything on like,

1858
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,206
"Hey, you volunteered
to do this

1859
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,551
"and you couldn't pull it out

1860
01:20:32,655 --> 01:20:34,103
at the end of the day," to me,

1861
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:36,379
that's not a great strategy
right now.

1862
01:20:36,482 --> 01:20:39,448
So I think
that won't be what it rides on.

1863
01:20:39,551 --> 01:20:41,172
For me, it's almost

1864
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:43,137
a first-come,
first-serve situation.

1865
01:20:43,241 --> 01:20:45,172
You know?
Who reached out to me first?

1866
01:20:45,275 --> 01:20:49,172
Who has been making an effort
to make some kind of connection?

1867
01:20:49,275 --> 01:20:50,931
Those things really do matter

1868
01:20:51,034 --> 01:20:53,482
because that lends itself
to trust.

1869
01:20:53,586 --> 01:20:55,931
- You know?
- Mm-hmm. It's like
that validation you need when,

1870
01:20:56,034 --> 01:20:57,448
you know, you just started
dating someone,

1871
01:20:57,551 --> 01:20:59,241
and you need that affirmation
from someone to...

1872
01:20:59,344 --> 01:21:01,275
- Yeah. Text me back.
- Yeah, exactly. Like,

1873
01:21:01,379 --> 01:21:02,793
give me a little bit
to go off of, and then...

1874
01:21:02,896 --> 01:21:04,586
and then you hitch onto that
and you realize,

1875
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:07,862
"Okay, I'm being affirmed
that this is where I want to go,

1876
01:21:07,965 --> 01:21:09,137
and I'm not crazy."

1877
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:11,000
And, you know, you...

1878
01:21:11,103 --> 01:21:13,620
- It's reciprocal from there on.
- Yeah.
- Morriah, did you feel

1879
01:21:13,724 --> 01:21:15,551
that people texted you back?

1880
01:21:15,655 --> 01:21:17,793
I got some emojis and stuff.
I'm not gonna...

1881
01:21:17,896 --> 01:21:19,620
I'm not going to go
into details, Jeff.

1882
01:21:19,724 --> 01:21:22,448
No, but I do feel
like some people text,

1883
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:24,103
and I got a few phone calls
here and there,

1884
01:21:24,206 --> 01:21:26,413
and I'd like to think
that I sent out a few texts

1885
01:21:26,517 --> 01:21:27,758
and phone calls as well.

1886
01:21:27,862 --> 01:21:29,758
And it's scary

1887
01:21:29,862 --> 01:21:32,206
because we're kind of
out of this trance

1888
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:34,896
that we've been in,
and every single person today

1889
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,724
is going to pick up that pen
and write a name.

1890
01:21:36,827 --> 01:21:38,827
- Yup.
- I kind of feel
that same way. I feel like

1891
01:21:38,931 --> 01:21:41,413
now we're playing the game.
The game is on,

1892
01:21:41,517 --> 01:21:44,206
and it's on full force.
I mean, at the end

1893
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:47,827
of tonight, somebody is going
to be looking back like,

1894
01:21:47,931 --> 01:21:49,137
"What if I was
a little bit more aggressive?

1895
01:21:49,241 --> 01:21:51,551
Could I have made it
a little bit further?"

1896
01:21:51,655 --> 01:21:54,172
It's really interesting
how this conversation

1897
01:21:54,275 --> 01:21:56,793
started with all of you
entrenched in this idea

1898
01:21:56,896 --> 01:22:00,344
of a happy tribe, and now that
we are literally moments away

1899
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:04,137
from voting,
I'm feeling the tension.

1900
01:22:04,241 --> 01:22:06,620
It's the price we pay for trying
to be kumbaya for too long.

1901
01:22:06,724 --> 01:22:08,413
And I think
whoever does go home is going

1902
01:22:08,517 --> 01:22:10,724
to wish they sent
a few more texts out and

1903
01:22:10,827 --> 01:22:13,793
had-had something cooking
a little bit better.

1904
01:22:15,551 --> 01:22:18,827
All right, with that,
it is time to vote. Sami,

1905
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:20,172
you're up.

1906
01:22:30,689 --> 01:22:33,965
I really do hate this.

1907
01:22:42,275 --> 01:22:44,206
Wow.

1908
01:23:08,034 --> 01:23:09,482
If anybody has an advantage

1909
01:23:09,586 --> 01:23:11,000
or an idol they want to play,

1910
01:23:11,103 --> 01:23:12,517
now would be the time to do so.

1911
01:23:18,517 --> 01:23:20,620
All right, I'll read the votes.

1912
01:23:24,103 --> 01:23:26,275
First vote-- Morriah.

1913
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:33,448
Owen. One vote-- Morriah,
one vote-- Owen.

1914
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:39,379
Morriah. Two votes-- Morriah,
one vote-- Owen.

1915
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:47,758
Morriah. That's three votes--
Morriah, one vote-- Owen.

1916
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,689
First person voted out
of <i>Survivor 43--</i> Morriah.

1917
01:23:56,793 --> 01:23:59,000
That's four. That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

1918
01:23:59,103 --> 01:24:02,413
I love you guys. It's okay.

1919
01:24:02,517 --> 01:24:04,310
- Love you.
- Love you guys.

1920
01:24:04,413 --> 01:24:05,689
- It's been a blast, guys.
- I'm going to miss you.

1921
01:24:05,793 --> 01:24:07,137
You're amazing.

1922
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:16,000
Morriah, the tribe has spoken.

1923
01:24:16,103 --> 01:24:18,000
Thanks, Jeff.

1924
01:24:18,103 --> 01:24:21,000
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1925
01:24:31,068 --> 01:24:32,551
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

1926
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:34,000
Good night.

That storm was a beating.</i>

1930
01:25:07,448 --> 01:25:09,379
This game is blowing my mind
right now.

<i>
They believe that I'm with them,</i>

1932
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,172
but there's a girls alliance.

1933
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,310
I want to jump off that
'cause it looks really fun.

1934
01:25:16,517 --> 01:25:18,068
Tribal lines
are getting clearer.

1935
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:26,862
It's heartbreaking to be going,

1936
01:25:26,965 --> 01:25:29,068

1937

<i>I genuinely love
the Baka tribe,</i>

1941

<i>and I'm so proud of them and
so proud of how they played.</i>

1942
01:25:42,172 --> 01:25:43,689
And I hope they get far
in the game.
