1
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:15,689
Hey, real quick, I just--
I want to say two things.

2
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:18,379
Just, first of all,
I'm sorry for getting

3
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:21,034
a little worked up and anxious,

4
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:23,862
but just definitively knowing
my name was coming up, like,

5
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:26,034
- it definitely was
fear-inducing.
- Sure. Of course.

6
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:27,724
<i>
Tonight was wild.</i>

7
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,344
<i>Morriah went home.</i>

8
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:32,482
<i>But when I saw my name come up,
I wanted to poop my pants.</i>

9
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:34,448
Looking down the barrel
of potentially going home,

10
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,482
it was absolutely terrifying.

11
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:38,655
More importantly,
I just want to say thank you,

12
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,275
not just for keeping me

13
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,758
but just for-for being who
I thought you were, you know?

14
00:00:42,862 --> 00:00:44,965
<i>I'm just so relieved that</i>

15
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:46,862
my trust in the people
that are here,

16
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:50,344
<i>in Gabler and Jeanine
and Elie and Sami, like,</i>

17
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:51,896
that was not unfounded.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,793
I hope this vote solidifies
trust, you know?

19
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:56,275
Like, we all did
what we said we would do.

20
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,206
That was like a trust exercise
we just went through.

21
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,206
Well, it was. I mean, heck,

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,655
I trusted you guys
not even to play my idol, so...

23
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:04,689
- Yeah.
- I mean...
- I know.

24
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:08,758
<i>Our tribe has been
slow to get into the game</i>

25
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:11,034
<i>because up until now we've been</i>

26
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,172
very much focused
on the relationships

27
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:15,000
and getting to know one another,

28
00:01:15,103 --> 00:01:17,344
<i>so there's a lot of stuff
we still have to do,</i>

29
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,655
<i>but if we can take care of
our bodies a little bit better,</i>

30
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:21,827
<i>I think we'll be
that much better in challenges,</i>

31
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,448
and hopefully that doesn't put
us back in, in Tribal Council.

32
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,103
You know, tomorrow I think
it's real important

33
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:29,620
for us to find some food.

34
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,241
I'm thinking of worms.

35
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:34,448
We can fry 'em up and
that will be our <i>Survivor</i> bacon.

36
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:37,344
I've been on fumes here
the last couple days.

37
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:41,517
Oh, boy.

38
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,551
Is there anything going there?

39
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:23,931
There are some embers in here.

40
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,068
We just got to find 'em.

41
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:26,413
Right there.

42
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:28,000
<i>
That was the roughest night</i>

43
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:29,827
<i>I've ever had in my entire life.</i>

44
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:30,827
<i>Back at home,</i>

45
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:31,965
when it starts raining,

46
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,172
I could go
to the convenience store

47
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:34,172
and wait for my mom
to pick me up

48
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,344
or I could run inside

49
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:36,344
or I could throw
my windshield wipers on.

50
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,103
We can't do that out here.

51
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:42,068
<i>And I don't know if anybody
has ever tried to do anything</i>

52
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:44,206
<i>while they're just completely
drenched and everything.</i>

53
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,620
But sleeping?

54
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:47,241
That's not-- it's not happening
while you're wet.

55
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:50,000
We might have to come up
with a different roof situation.

56
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,206
Yeah.

57
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,965
- That is getting done today.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:56,172
<i>We were not prepared
for that storm last night.</i>

59
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,103
<i>That was a beating.</i>

60
00:02:58,206 --> 00:02:59,344
<i>It was scary</i>

61
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:02,103
'cause that storm came in
so loud, so fast.

62
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:04,620
The wind went from, like, this
to probably,

63
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,137
you know, 40-mile-an-hour wind.

64
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:09,413
What a night.

65
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:11,206
- I've never had a night
like that, ever.
- Seriously.

66
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,758
That was pretty brutal.

67
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:14,206
<i>
This adventure is</i>

68
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,689
everything I can take
and maybe a little bit more.

69
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:20,241
<i>I've never pushed
my physical boundaries this far</i>

70
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:21,724
<i>in my entire life.</i>

71
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,827
<i>And I played football,
ran track, was a boxer.</i>

72
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:28,310
<i>I do a lot of big hiking
with heavy packs on my back</i>

73
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:30,068
<i>in mountains, in high altitude,</i>

74
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:31,448
but, you know, I've got food,
I've got water.

75
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:32,448
I can stop and do whatever.

76
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:33,827
This is like-- there's just--

77
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,965
<i>you never know
and you're never dry.</i>

78
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:36,965
<i>So this game</i>

79
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:39,275
is blowing my mind right now.

80
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:42,103
Those gulps of water,
which I know are good for me,

81
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:43,482
I just feel
like puking right now.

82
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:44,517
Oh, man.

83
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,413
<i>I am worried about Gabler.</i>

84
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,758
He's a big guy
and he's running out of steam,

85
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,413
<i>and I worry
that he's not gonna be able</i>

86
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:52,620
<i>to sustain himself out here.</i>

87
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:54,241
- Uh-oh.

88
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,034
Very. I'm extremely nauseous.

89
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,827
<i>
So I'm not 100% sure if he is
the best piece of the puzzle</i>

90
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:06,068
<i>for this tribe moving forward
'cause he's a strong man, but</i>

91
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:08,724
it doesn't do us any good
if he's lying on the ground.

92
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:15,551
<i>
I'm 20 to 30 years older
than some of my teammates,</i>

93
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,310
<i>but I don't want them
to look at me</i>

94
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:20,896
<i>and think that I'm dead weight.</i>

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,413
<i>It's walking a fine line</i>

96
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:23,620
because, I mean,
I had to lay down

97
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:25,724
this morning for,
you know, a couple hours

98
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:27,103
<i>while everybody was getting
the fire going,</i>

99
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:28,758
<i>and I know every minute</i>

100
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:31,344
<i>I'm laying down, resting,
and I'm getting stronger,</i>

101
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:32,551
<i>I'm getting weaker in the game.</i>

102
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,034
Long enough?

103
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:35,310
- It's okay.
- Great.

104
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:36,758
<i>
The longer I have to loaf,</i>

105
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,379
<i>if you will, to manage my body,</i>

106
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:41,482
the more of a liability
I become.

107
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,241
Yeah, yeah, I'll just yell
if somebody's coming.

108
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:57,965
<i>
Advantages are all-important
in this game.</i>

109
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:00,482
<i>This is the new era
of</i> Survivor, <i>and there's a lot</i>

110
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:01,965
<i>of new dangerous twists.</i>

111
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,275
It's a 26-day season.

112
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,620
You got to play aggressive
from the jump,

113
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:07,000
<i>so having that advantage
would be huge.</i>

114
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,206
Yeah.

115
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay, yeah.

116
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,517
Yeah.

117
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,172
<i>Our tribe
is doing all right now,</i>

118
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,517
<i>which feels great.</i>

119
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,931
I think that we work well together.

120
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,896
I think we have
a good sort of sense of unity

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,413
and a good sense of teamwork,

122
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:41,068
<i>but at the same time it seems</i>

123
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,241
<i>like the tribal lines
are getting clearer.</i>

124
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,517
<i>Noelle and Justine cliqued up,
like, almost immediately,</i>

125
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,137
<i>and me, Cody, and Nneka
are tight,</i>

126
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:52,793
<i>and Dwight-- he's on his own,
basically, so I'm trying</i>

127
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:54,034
to really build
that bond with him

128
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,758
and make sure
that we're a tight pair

129
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:59,103
<i>because I think we could be
good partners going forward.</i>

130
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:00,758
Back home,
like, all my decisions

131
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:03,241
have been made in a partnership,
right, like...

132
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,862
Oh, Lord.

133
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:20,931
<i>
I wanted to come in here
and find somebody I trust</i>

134
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:23,793
<i>immediately,
and Jesse's that person.</i>

135
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:26,034
He's someone that I could
rock with the entire game,

136
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,655
<i>but at the same time I feel
like I've made good social bonds</i>

137
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,965
<i>with everybody on my tribe,</i>

138
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:33,655
<i>and I've been able to do that
ever since I was a kid.</i>

139
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:35,448
<i>When I was in school,
whenever there was, like,</i>

140
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:38,448
<i>some events nearby with
influential political figures,</i>

141
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,724
<i>I'd reach out and say, like,</i>

142
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:40,896
<i>"Hey, I'm a junior journalist.</i>

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,241
<i>Can I interview you?"</i>

144
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:44,413
<i>Those included
Madeleine Albright,</i>

145
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,137
<i>Dr. Condoleezza Rice,
Colin Powell.</i>

146
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,724
<i>I'd just go up to them, start
talking, start asking questions,</i>

147
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:50,482
<i>and I didn't really have
that fear in me,</i>

148
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:53,034
<i>and even to this day I don't
fear walking up to people</i>

149
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:55,655
<i>and just talking to them,
so in the game of</i> Survivor,

150
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:56,965
I'm talking to everybody,

151
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,620
no fear,
having a good conversation.

152
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:00,034
<i>That allows me to build</i>

153
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,379
<i>these really great bonds
with these people,</i>

154
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:04,000
except for possibly Cody.

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,896
<i>
Yeah.</i>

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,206
I really like Cody,

157
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,620
but, like,
we never talk game at all.

158
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:12,931
- For real?
- No, like,

159
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,551
we'll just, like,
talk about life, whatever,

160
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:16,448
but it's never game-related.

161
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:17,551
<i>- So...
- Yeah.</i>

162
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,344
- But got to do it.
- Yeah.

163
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,103
<i>
Dwight doesn't
really trust Cody.</i>

164
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:33,931
<i>Yeah, he doesn't talk strategy,
but I'm okay with that.</i>

165
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,620
:
Cody's just Cody.

166
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:37,103
He's just kind of off
on his own.

167
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,827
I want to jump off that
'cause it looks really fun

168
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:41,344
and it feels like home.

169
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:44,551
Like, we always go jump
off bridges, jump off rocks.

170
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:45,793
Pretty inviting.

171
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:47,310
That's beautiful.
I want to climb up there

172
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,103
'cause I bet
nobody's ever done it before.

173
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,655
<i>And it gets kind of boring
at camp</i>

174
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:52,551
<i>just sitting around,
eating coconuts.</i>

175
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:54,586
<i>
Cody's fun, man, honestly.</i>

176
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:55,965
At first
you're thinking, like,

177
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,448
oh, this guy's crazy
'cause he's just, like,

178
00:07:57,551 --> 00:07:59,965
spouting out these wild ideas
and stuff, but then,

179
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:02,689
<i>like, I realized
he just likes to have fun.</i>

180
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,275
What do you think of my hat?

181
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm gonna wear it
loud and proud.

182
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:10,758
<i>
Cody's just living, dude.</i>

183
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,413
<i>Like, it says it on his ass--
he's living.</i>

184
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,689
<i>
You want to enjoy your time
while you're out here.</i>

185
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,000
You know, like...

186
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:26,793
<i>- You know what I mean?
- Yes, sir.</i>

187
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:28,655
... yeah.

188
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,551
- Livin'.
- Livin'. L-I-V-I-N.

189
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:34,620
<i>
So, like, I'm not
that worried about Cody.</i>

190
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,965
<i>Honestly, like, I'm able
to connect with, like,</i>

191
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,586
almost everybody on the tribe
except for Justine.

192
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,517
- Oh, my God.
- What?

193
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:43,827
Oh.

194
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,551
Oh, my God, there's a spider
right there, too.

195
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,275
Oh, my God, I just
keep walking into them.

196
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,655
Aah!

197
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:51,241
I literally see spiders
crawling all around.

198
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:52,689
<i>
I don't know, maybe it's like</i>

199
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:55,000
the four days of hunger,
but I'm starting to get annoyed.

200
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:58,482
Wait, Cody, do you mind
putting it over one?

201
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:02,172
'Cause that makes this side
of the bed a lot smaller.

202
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,517
Or, like, drag it over
a little bit?

203
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,793
Okay.

204
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:09,172
<i>
The thing about
Justine is, like,</i>

205
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,724
<i>I don't know how much we jibe.</i>

206
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:13,896
<i>She lives, like, a city
over from where I grew up,</i>

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,862
<i>but I think she's just
a different kind of person.</i>

208
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:18,103
My nails are so disgusting.

209
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:22,103
<i>
But at this point we don't
have to make a decision.</i>

210
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:26,103
<i>Also, Dwight risked and lost
his vote on the journey, so...</i>

211
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,000
at the end of the day,
he doesn't really have a say.

212
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,965
I would like to sort of be
on the same page as him,

213
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,896
<i>but right now I'm sort of
in the driver's seat,</i>

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,827
<i>which is awesome.</i>

215
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:44,344
So... bring your foot back.

216
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:49,517
You're gonna pull it out
and then back in.

217
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,827
Back, forward, same foot.

218
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,965
<i>We dominated
our first immunity challenge,</i>

219
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:56,551
<i>and that is
such a good feeling because</i>

220
00:09:56,655 --> 00:10:00,000
<i>overall the Coco tribe
is still pretty united,</i>

221
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,758
<i>but when you start peeling back
those layers,</i>

222
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:05,413
you can kind of see
where the divides occur.

223
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:06,758
Did you guys finish
all your sets?

224
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:08,379
- Yes.
- Five on each side?

225
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,586
<i>
There's a three-person
girls alliance,</i>

226
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:13,620
<i>which is me, Lindsay,</i>

227
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:17,482
<i>Cassidy, and we're bringing in
James to be our fourth.</i>

228
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:19,689
Yeah. Come on.

229
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:25,344
<i>
That leaves Geo and Ryan.
They believe</i>

230
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:28,517
<i>that I'm in a solid three
with them.</i>

231
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,517
You're trying to expand
this part when you breathe in.

232
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,448
<i>
But what is making me</i>

233
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,620
a little bit more cautious is,

234
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:39,655
<i>Ryan is very close to Geo.</i>

235
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:42,034
- Okay, I...

236
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:44,103
- You get... you get it?
- Yeah.

237
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:49,793
-  Yes.
- Look at you.

238
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:52,413
- There's a bunch of these trees.
- Yeah.

239
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:53,517
There's another one right there.

240
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,137
Okay.

241
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,379
Ah, no, you got it.
You really were right.

242
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:59,724
So, if you really don't...
Okay, let's try that.

243
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,655
- Let's find out.
- We should open this?

244
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:08,000
Look at you go.

245
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,310
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

246
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:24,379
<i>Watching the show from TV,
you're, like,</i>

247
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,896
<i>Everything looks so much easier,
like, anybody can do it,</i>

248
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
<i>and it's not.</i>

249
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,827
Just one almond in there?

250
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,034
<i>But I've gone through
so many struggles in life.</i>

251
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:38,448
<i>I had to overcome
so many things.</i>

252
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:42,689
I've kind of always knew
that I was gay

253
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:44,034
from a very young age.

254
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,689
I knew that I was different.

255
00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:50,448
<i>When I turned 18,</i>

256
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:54,034
<i>I decided to come out
to my parents, and</i>

257
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:57,310
their... I guess their dreams
kind of, like,

258
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:58,896
came down crashing

259
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,862
because I wasn't the person
that they wanted me to be.

260
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:04,241
<i>That was kind of hard for me</i>

261
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:07,344
<i>because I always had that
in the back of my head</i>

262
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:09,551
<i>that if I ever tell my family</i>

263
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:13,172
that I am not straight,

264
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,379
that they would not
love me anymore

265
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:19,034
or they would not want
to be with me anymore.

266
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,724
<i>My parents didn't agree
with me being gay.</i>

267
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:28,034
<i>They ended up pretty much
telling me that</i>

268
00:12:28,137 --> 00:12:30,827
<i>if I'm not gonna
change the way I am,</i>

269
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:33,620
then I will have to go somewhere
else or leave the house.

270
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:36,000
- Oh, this one's pretty good.
- Yeah.

271
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:37,655
<i>
Because of that,
I was kind of forced</i>

272
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,379
to going through
a homeless stage.

273
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:43,206
<i>As a lot of people know,</i>

274
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,310
<i>the LGBT community has
a very high rate of suicide</i>

275
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:49,172
and depression, and I did

276
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,517
<i>consider not continuing my life,</i>

277
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,482
<i>but I had to learn
how to look at the positive.</i>

278
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:59,551
<i>So I told myself,</i>

279
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,448
"This is your chance
to make it happen in life.

280
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,482
"This is your chance
to keep going

281
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:07,724
<i>"and don't let anything
or anyone stop you</i>

282
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:10,275
<i>from whatever
you want to accomplish."</i>

283
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:12,172
And that's exactly how
I'm gonna play this game.

284
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,413
I'm gonna tell you right now.

285
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:18,310
I am not gonna let anything
or anyone get in my way.

286
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,448
Oh.

287
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:27,517
<i>Me and Geo feel like</i>

288
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,137
we've known each other
since before <i>Survivor.</i>

289
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:34,103
<i>I accept him. I feel like he's
able to be himself around me.</i>

290
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,413
- Oh.
- Okay, cool.
They're in here.

291
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:37,758
<i>
And that's something I feel</i>

292
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:39,137
<i>he really looks for in life--</i>

293
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,724
to be himself and not
to have to hide anything.

294
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:44,482
Yes, we do.

295
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:46,000
- We-we have a rhythm.
- Yeah. Yeah.

296
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:47,793
<i>
So I do think there is</i>

297
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:49,275
a good push-and-pull
that we have.

298
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,655
- Consider myself a new brother.
- That works for me.

299
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:57,137
<i>
I think if we can take control</i>

300
00:13:57,241 --> 00:13:59,689
<i>and really pay attention,</i>

301
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:02,793
we can go pretty far.
I think we'll be a good duo.

302
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:16,172
My hands are so wet.
I can't even get this on.

303
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:22,758
<i>
Meeting Noelle was really cool.</i>

304
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,551
I-I wanted to meet her seeing
that she had, obviously, one leg

305
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:26,931
<i>'cause there's a huge story
behind that,</i>

306
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,310
<i>and I love to hear those things.</i>

307
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:50,724
<i>In high school,
my best friend lost his leg.</i>

308
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:52,758
<i>At first I was like, "Oh.</i>

309
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:55,689
That's the end of the world,"
and then, it progressed to...

310
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,344
You know,
he's up in heaven with us now,

311
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:58,862
and he's watching over me
right now

312
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,551
here on the game
of <i>Survivor,</i> but

313
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:04,241
<i>that really changed
the way I live my life.</i>

314
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:06,275
You're, like,
living a dream life, Cody.

315
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:07,931
Was there a moment
that spread that,

316
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,655
or, like,
have you always been that way?

317
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:13,137
Uh, I've been pretty, like,
crazy my whole life.

318
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:16,517
But, like, for me,
part of, like, my drive is,

319
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,965
I had a high school friend
die of cancer.

320
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:24,241
And then, like,
a year later, he passed.

321
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:26,551
<i>I grew up
in a small town in Iowa.</i>

322
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:30,310
<i>A thousand people in my town,
28 kids in my graduating class.</i>

323
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,758
<i>With that small of a school,
we're all pretty tight.</i>

324
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:38,068
<i>And I realized when Devon died
that life was very fragile.</i>

325
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,551
<i>I really had
to watch him struggle.</i>

326
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:44,448
And I think that's-that's why it
affected me as much as it did.

327
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:46,000
<i>At that age,</i>

328
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:49,827
<i>to have to watch how vicious</i>

329
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:53,758
life can be to someone
that doesn't deserve it--

330
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:57,310
<i>that made it really,
really tough.</i>

331
00:15:57,413 --> 00:16:00,379
<i>But it put things
into perspective, and</i>

332
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:02,586
without that experience,
I wouldn't be...

333
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:03,965
I wouldn't be here today.

334
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:06,206
I wouldn't...
I wouldn't reside in Hawaii.

335
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,896
<i>I wouldn't have taken
some of the risks</i>

336
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,103
<i>that I have taken in my life.</i>

337
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:14,172
<i>So I'm gonna play</i> Survivor <i>
as hard and as fast as I can,</i>

338
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,241
<i>just like I do in my life.
I ain't letting a day</i>

339
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:19,655
<i>go by out here
without really living.</i>

340
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:21,000
<i>There's not a day</i>

341
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,724
I'm gonna let go
that I can't go to bed

342
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:25,172
and be like,
"I had a good time today."

343
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:50,896
<i>My friends back home describe
me sometimes as a, uh...</i>

344
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,862
a lovable curmudgeon,
and I'm trying

345
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:54,379
to keep the curmudgeon
under wraps.

346
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:03,793
<i>I've tried to be</i>

347
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:05,344
a bit more measured, and I think
all my friends at home

348
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:08,206
<i>are gonna
be very proud of how</i>

349
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,068
much I've held it together
to this point.

350
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,310
Aah!

351
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,655
Someone had to do it

352
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:28,965
'cause these fools don't like
drinking water that much.

353
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:30,758
But I'm fine. I'm fine.

354
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:33,413
I don't need... Yes, you do.

355
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,965
I feel like the next vote

356
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:58,379
is gonna be a really tough one.

357
00:17:58,482 --> 00:18:00,241
I feel like you and me need
to be thinking about, like,

358
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:02,137
who would be a safe bet
for a vote.

359
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:03,620
- You know?
- Yes, for sure.

360
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:05,517
<i>Going to Tribal kicked things
into gear,</i>

361
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,689
<i>and really forced us
to now be in game mode.</i>

362
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:10,551
So I've been talking strategy
with Elie.

363
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:13,000
Obviously, we've been close
from the start.

364
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:15,793
<i>And we have our pick
of whether we want to bring in</i>

365
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,517
Owen or Sami as our third.

366
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,862
Who do you feel close with
outside of this?

367
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:24,517
<i>
I think, at first, Owen,</i>

368
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,275
<i>but maybe more recently,
Sami, only because</i>

369
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:29,172
<i>Owen's gonna be a lot</i>

370
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,586
to manage, like,
once we get to the merge.

371
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:34,620
I feel a little bit like
Sami and Owen are my children.

372
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:37,586
<i>Sami is my firstborn, and
he came out really independent,</i>

373
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:39,413
<i>and, you know, strong-willed.</i>

374
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:40,862
<i>He can kind of take charge</i>

375
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:43,068
<i>and doesn't need
a lot of tending to.</i>

376
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:46,586
<i>And Owen is, like,
my baby boy, my second born.</i>

377
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:49,931
<i>Even though he's older, he needs
a lot more attention, and so,</i>

378
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:51,620
he's the more
high-maintenance child

379
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:52,758
<i>in this situation.</i>

380
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:55,965
If you need to take a break,
you can take a break.

381
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,793
Okay? So the frustration

382
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:00,517
- makes it harder, right?

383
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:02,896
Okay. Yeah.

384
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,068
I know.

385
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,034
I'm so confused about it.
Are they doing something

386
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:15,413
that we're just not seeing?

387
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:18,034
This foot seems worse
than the other one.

388
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:20,517
Mine are equally pruning
and gross right now.

389
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,724
You guys know
who Patrick Mahomes is?

390
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,724
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
- I'm Patrick Mahomes.

391
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:26,000
Dude, you're rocking
his haircut. Yeah.

392
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:27,344
You look like him, yeah.

393
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:29,034
You kind of look
like him, man. Geez.

394
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:39,655
But I think that it's opened the
door for the two of us to be,

395
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:43,172
like, strategic incognito.

396
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:44,793
I wonder
if they're talking about us.

397
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:46,724
You got to take it
into consideration.

398
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:48,620
- They do seem pretty close.
- Hmm.

399
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:51,103
But here's the dealio.
It doesn't matter.

400
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:54,137
- One, two, three.
- Yeah.
- It's true.

401
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,379
<i>The guys need
to look out for each other</i>

402
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:57,931
in the event
that this thing goes south

403
00:19:58,034 --> 00:19:59,551
and those girls stick together.

404
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:01,310
<i>Because those girls
will vote together</i>

405
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:03,275
<i>to the very end of this game.</i>

406
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:06,517
<i>And I think that the best way
for me to go right now</i>

407
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,448
<i>is with Gabler and Owen.</i>

408
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:10,241
If they try
to pull something funny

409
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:12,586
and pull aside any one of us...

410
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:13,931
Then we know what to do.

411
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,482
I genuinely hope

412
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:17,275
- it doesn't come to that.
- I hope it doesn't, too.

413
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:19,275
- But the game's on now.
- The game is on.
- Yeah.

414
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,275
We got to look out
for each other.

415
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:22,379
I got you boys always.

416
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:23,551
<i>I'm not the kind of person</i>

417
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,655
that enjoys the whole guys

418
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:26,241
or girls alliance, or...

419
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:28,689
I don't-I don't think
that alliances should be based

420
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,068
<i>off of that,
but I think me, Gabler</i>

421
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:32,896
<i>and Owen are being
completely underestimated</i>

422
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
<i>by the women altogether.</i>

423
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,827
<i>So, we have to be able to look
out for each other 'cause</i>

424
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:39,413
we have the numbers,
and we will be stupid

425
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:41,517
<i>to lose to them.</i>

426
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:57,034
Come on in.

427
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,137
Vesi, Coco,
getting your first look

428
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:19,724
at the new Baka tribe.

429
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:22,620
Morriah voted out
at the first Tribal Council.

430
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:28,206
All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

431
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,862
- Let's go.

432
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:32,000
First things first.
Got to take back the idols.

433
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:34,241
- It's coming back.
- With Coco.

434
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:36,896
- Just win it back.
- That's the plan.

435
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,862
Thank you.

436
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,068
All right, once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

437
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,931
For today's challenge,

438
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:49,137
<i>you're gonna dive into the
ocean and swim to a tall cage.</i>

439
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,931
<i>You then have
to get up and over the cage</i>

440
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:55,275
<i>to release a very heavy snake.</i>

441
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:58,000
<i>You then have to get that snake
out of the cage,</i>

442
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:00,241
<i>drag it to a table</i>

443
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,413
<i>where you will release
number tiles.</i>

444
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:06,724
<i>You'll use those tiles
to solve a combination lock.</i>

445
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,517
<i>Then two players will race</i>

446
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,655
<i>to solve a massive</i>
Survivor <i>puzzle.</i>

447
00:22:12,758 --> 00:22:16,724
First two tribes to finish win
immunity, safe from the vote.

448
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:18,379
You're also playing for reward.

449
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:22,551
Want to know
what you're playing for?

450
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:24,172
- Yes, sir, Jeff.

451
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:27,241
- Yes, Jeff.
- First tribe to finish.

452
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,275
- Oh, my God.

453
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:32,172
A complete <i>Survivor</i> fishing kit.

454
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:34,068
Second tribe to finish--

455
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:35,758
it's smaller,
but it'll get the job done.

456
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:38,379
Hey, it still works.

457
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,482
Last tribe to finish,
otherwise known as the losers--

458
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,551
Tribal Council tonight
where somebody will be

459
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,344
the second person
voted out of this game.

460
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,517
And as a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint. Baka,

461
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,275
you're playing today
to get yours back.

462
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:51,448
All right, we have sit-outs.

463
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:52,862
Vesi, who's gonna be
the sit-out?

464
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:54,862
Get us this fishing gear.

465
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:56,482
- I am.
- Noelle's gonna
sit this one out.

466
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:57,931
Coco, who's it gonna be?

467
00:22:58,034 --> 00:22:59,103
I'm sitting out.

468
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:00,586
Karla's gonna sit up.
All right.

469
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,034
Sit-outs take spot on the bench.

470
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:03,275
Everybody else,
give you a minute strategize

471
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:04,379
and we will get going.

472
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:13,137
All right, here we go.
For immunity

473
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:15,413
and reward,

474
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:16,793
Survivors ready?

475
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:22,034
- Go!

476
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,517
- Go, Vesi!
- Let's go, Coco!

477
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,137
Everybody's swimming quickly.

478
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,344
You got to get all five players

479
00:23:31,448 --> 00:23:33,517
to that first edge of the gate

480
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,724
before you can
start heading over.

481
00:23:36,827 --> 00:23:38,551
Coco, you're good.
Baka, you're good.

482
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:40,758
- Vesi, you're good.
- Let's go, James!

483
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:42,655
Let's go, Ryan! Good job!

484
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,620
You cannot go through the cage.

485
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,344
You've got to go up and over.

486
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:49,000
Here we go, Vesi!

487
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:55,000
Now you got
to untie that snake and start

488
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:57,965
working it over
the other side of the cage.

489
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,586
You can ask people
on either side of that gate

490
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:08,103
to push or pull that snake
once you have it untied.

491
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:10,793
Cody now starting
to lift for Vesi.

492
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:13,586
That is 400 pounds
of <i>Survivor</i> snake.

493
00:24:13,689 --> 00:24:15,172
Let's go!

494
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:17,517
You are trying
to maneuver all the way

495
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,586
- to the top
through to the other side.

496
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:24,896
- One, two, three.
- Go, Coco!

497
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,275
Vesi doing a nice job
working together.

498
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:30,172
Coco trying
to get that snake up.

499
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:35,448
You can see
how heavy the snake is.

500
00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:38,241
- You can't let go
once you get it up top.

501
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:49,482
-
It is Baka now in the lead.

502
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:51,172
- Vesi...
- Way to go, Vesi!

503
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:53,724
- making progress.
- Lift up.

504
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:57,103
Lindsay hanging from the snake.

505
00:24:57,206 --> 00:25:00,551
Ryan, one pull at a time,
is pulling that snake

506
00:25:00,655 --> 00:25:02,689
over the edge.

507
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,620
- Good job!

508
00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:07,655
Cody trying
to just wrestle it down.

509
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:12,586
Baka has their snake.

510
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:14,724
Now you got to
get everybody over.

511
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:18,241
There goes Ryan,
very close to the end.

512
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:19,413
Let's go!

513
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,724
There's Gabler.

514
00:25:20,827 --> 00:25:21,793
You're good, Baka.

515
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:26,413
- Coco has their snake.
- All right.

516
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:29,586
Cody is literally hanging on

517
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:32,000
to the snake
like he's riding it.

518
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:33,068
Go!

519
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:35,344
You're good, Coco.

520
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:36,689
Start heading in.

521
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:39,620
It is Baka in the lead,
followed by Coco.

522
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:42,034
- Good job!
- Vesi very close.

523
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:45,586
- One big pull.

524
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:47,517
There you go, Vesi!

525
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,965
Okay, here we go!

526
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:51,068
Get over, Jesse.

527
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:52,793
You're good.
Start heading in.

528
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,344
Let's go, Coco!
You got this. Come on.

529
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:57,724
It's very close--
Baka and Coco.

530
00:25:57,827 --> 00:25:59,758
Vesi coming behind.

531
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:03,275
Now you've got
to go under a barrier

532
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:06,965
which will also be tough 'cause
you're dragging the snake down.

533
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:12,689
You're still in this, Vesi.
Let's go. Dig now!

534
00:26:12,793 --> 00:26:13,896
One.

535
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,344
Baka into the next stage.

536
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,655
Coco right on their tail. Sometimes

537
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:21,379
it comes down to seconds,
which is why

538
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:23,758
you're digging all the time.

539
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:27,896
One, two, three, go.

540
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,379
- One, two.

541
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:35,482
You got to get that snake

542
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:37,103
all the way
to the end of your table.

543
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:43,310
It is Baka, Coco and then Vesi.

544
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:46,413
Vesi slowly gaining
on both tribes.

545
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,034
- Right there.
- Come on, push!

546
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:51,068
There you go! Start untying.

547
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:52,482
You're looking
for the six tiles.

548
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:54,379
Three of them have numbers.

549
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:56,827
That's how you do it, Coco.
Keep pulling.

550
00:26:56,931 --> 00:26:59,517
One more big pull.

551
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,344
Start untying.

552
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:03,586
I got it, I got it, I got it.

553
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:04,931
Baka has their number tile.

554
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:08,517
It's gonna be Owen and Sami.

555
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,827
- Once we're free, we're good.
- Lindsay, free...

556
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:12,827
- What's wrong?
- Vesi, you got
to keep digging.

557
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,448
What happened?
Vesi completely came to a stop.

558
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:22,586
Baka solves their combination.
They're good.

559
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:26,206
You got Jeanine and Elie
for Baka. No, no.

560
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,689
Give 'em that. Not you. Go.

561
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:29,862
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Got to get that open.

562
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:32,379
There's a piece inside
you need for that puzzle.

563
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:35,344
Coco has their number tiles.

564
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:37,965
Geo and Ryan
opening that combination.

565
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,275
There we go! There we go!

566
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:46,758
There you go! Start untying!

567
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:49,896
There's a piece
by Jeanine and Elie.

568
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:54,620
Coco solves their combination.
They can start

569
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:55,931
working on the puzzle.

570
00:27:56,034 --> 00:28:00,034
You got Lindsay
and Cassidy for Coco.

571
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,068
You're right there, Coco!

572
00:28:02,172 --> 00:28:04,517
Yup. Let's go! Let's go!

573
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,103
Okay.

574
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:10,724
Jeanine and Elie for Baka.

575
00:28:10,827 --> 00:28:13,310
Vesi has their number tiles.

576
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:15,034
- Let's go, Vesi!
- No. That's gonna be up...

577
00:28:15,137 --> 00:28:17,103
There. Yeah, yeah. Just...
There it is.

578
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:19,896
Another piece by Elie.

579
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:24,655
Vesi solves their combination.
They can start working

580
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:27,103
- on the puzzle.
- Great job, Elie.

581
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,965
Now gonna be Nneka
and Dwight on the puzzle.

582
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:32,137
- Right now, Vesi!
- Right now,
it is Coco and Baka

583
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:35,172
- side by side.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

584
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:36,551
Then Vesi trying
to get back in this.

585
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:37,862
There you go, Nneka.

586
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:40,310
Two tribes will be safe.

587
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:42,137
Two tribes will stay intact.

588
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,793
One will go to Tribal
and lose a tribe member.

589
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:47,275
- Nice.
- Vesi, you're in this.

590
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:50,586
There are comebacks
in <i>Survivor</i> all the time.

591
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,103
- Ryan?
- Right there. Good job.

592
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:54,344
You need to get
that bottom part.

593
00:28:54,448 --> 00:28:56,931
- Okay, we need one like that?
- Hell, yes.
- Good job.

594
00:28:59,517 --> 00:29:03,310
Vesi once again dead still.

595
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:04,620
It's becoming a theme
in this challenge.

596
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:05,931
They get some momentum,

597
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:07,965
then they stop, talk, rest.

598
00:29:08,068 --> 00:29:09,310
You guys, we can't give up.
Come on.

599
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm not.
I'm not, I'm just thinking.

600
00:29:11,103 --> 00:29:14,275
You can't rest
on <i>Survivor,</i> ever.

601
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,482
You sleep
when you get back home.

602
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:20,068
And I don't mean your camp.
I mean back home.

603
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:23,344
Coco is closing the gap on Baka.

604
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:26,172
We got a challenge right now.

605
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:28,724
- There you go. Good.
- We're good.

606
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:31,206
It is Vesi in dead last,

607
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,551
looking at the Tribal Council
right now.

608
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:36,034
- Flip it over, Nneka,
and look at that. Yeah.
- They are stuck.

609
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:38,034
- Can't find the pieces
they need.
- Yeah.

610
00:29:38,137 --> 00:29:40,517
Nneka, stay down, stay down.

611
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,448
- No! Turn!
- They don't even know

612
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:44,793
if they have the right piece.

613
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:47,379
- It's right there!
- It is Baka and Coco

614
00:29:47,482 --> 00:29:50,137
side by side, piece by piece.

615
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:54,103
Vesi still moving
in slow motion.

616
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,896
Elie shoving her arm

617
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,517
through one of the openings
to get it in there.

618
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,689
Wow. We are really close.

619
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:05,206
Baka down to their last piece.

620
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,379
Careful, guys. Careful.

621
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:07,689
Jeanine and Elie.

622
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:09,068
Redemption for Jeanine.

623
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:10,896
They've got it!

624
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,379
Baka wins immunity.

625
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:15,517
Safe tonight
from Tribal Council.

626
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,379
Big fishing gear as well, and
they earned their flint back.

627
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:20,862
This one's over. You can put it

628
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:22,793
to deep freeze.
Vesi's out of it.

629
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:26,068
The last piece by Lindsay...

630
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:28,517
- That's got to be it.
- for the win.

631
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,931
Whoa.

632
00:30:32,034 --> 00:30:33,517
And they got it.

633
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,206
Coco wins immunity,
safe from Tribal Council,

634
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,793
sending Vesi to Tribal Council

635
00:30:39,896 --> 00:30:43,724
where the second person will be
voted out of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

636
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,862
That was the piece. That was the
small one that goes right there.

637
00:30:57,724 --> 00:30:59,586
Damn.

638
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:05,206
All right, hard fought.

639
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,965
- Ah.
- Baka.

640
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,068
- Coco.

641
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:13,758
Yeah, my baby.

642
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:16,482
Baka, no Tribal Council tonight,
nobody going home.

643
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:18,103
Large fishing gear will be

644
00:31:18,206 --> 00:31:19,965
waiting for you
back at your camp.

645
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:21,655
Well done.

646
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:24,517
- In addition,
you earned back your flint.

647
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,137
No, I can't catch [bleep].

648
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:30,896
Coco, Nicely done. No Tribal
Council tonight for you.

649
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,482
Nobody going home.

650
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:33,862
Smaller fishing gear
will be waiting

651
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:35,137
- for you back at camp.
- We'll take it.

652
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:37,448
- Thanks, Jeff! Let's go.

653
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:39,034
Baka, grab your stuff, head out.

654
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:40,517
Enjoy the night off.

655
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,103
- JEANINE and ELIE: Thanks, Jeff.
- Well earned.

656
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:44,793
Thank you, Jeff.

657
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,137
Cody, how many steps

658
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,413
before you're into your camp,

659
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:50,758
strategy kicks in,
and people start

660
00:31:50,862 --> 00:31:52,137
splitting off to talk?

661
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,517
- 20.
- So quickly?

662
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,448
I think so. I mean,
the parade's over, man.

663
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:00,068
It's hunt
or be hunted at this point.

664
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:02,206
Everybody's got
to go to Tribal, and,

665
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,517
unfortunately, one member of our
family is gonna have to go.

666
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,103
Nowhere to hide in a dangerous
game, and there's

667
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:09,241
very little room to hide when
there's only six tribe members.

668
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,275
Tribal Council tonight, Vesi.

669
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:13,206
Somebody will be the second
person voted out of this game.

670
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,172
And as a penalty for losing,
I got to take your flint.

671
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:18,827
Sorry for you.

672
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:20,448
You'll have a chance to win it
back in the next challenge.

673
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:21,689
Grab your stuff, head out.

674
00:32:21,793 --> 00:32:23,241
See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

675
00:32:23,344 --> 00:32:25,517
<i>It sucked
watching from the sidelines.</i>

676
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,241
<i>I'm a competitor.</i>

677
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:29,655
<i>I came out here not wanting
to sit out any challenges,</i>

678
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:31,275
<i>but now it turns out</i>

679
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:32,931
<i>that Nneka's not great
at jumping off things.</i>

680
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,413
<i>She's not great at puzzles.</i>

681
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,793
I'm so sick of it.
I just want

682
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:37,827
to have a strong, united group.

683
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:41,965
<i>So if we're gonna keep the
tribe strong, Nneka's got to go.</i>

684
00:32:56,965 --> 00:32:58,586
Gave it all we got.

685
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:05,793
Leaving that piece,
none of us caught it.

686
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:08,344
We all sat there
and watched the whole thing,

687
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:09,413
and none of us caught it.

688
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:10,758
So I don't know.

689
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:12,172
We can learn from our losses,

690
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:15,000
but, uh, tonight's gonna
be tragic. This sucks.

691
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:17,310
<i>Today's challenge was a beast,</i>

692
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,482
<i>and we got our butts kicked.</i>

693
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:21,689
<i>Now we're gonna Tribal,</i>

694
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:24,413
someone's going home,
and you're gonna have to

695
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:26,068
cut somebody
from your own ohana.

696
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,862
<i>And it's heartbreaking.</i>

697
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:35,586
<i>- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.</i>

698
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:37,965
<i>
Me and Nneka, we're very close.</i>

699
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,758
<i>I love Nneka's energy.</i>

700
00:33:39,862 --> 00:33:42,793
<i>She's got a positive attitude,
and we have a strong alliance.</i>

701
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:46,241
<i>Unfortunately, she really
struggled in the challenge.</i>

702
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:47,689
<i>So for some people,</i>

703
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,137
<i>it could be Nneka
on the chopping block,</i>

704
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:51,172
because keeping the tribe strong
is important.

705
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:53,655
<i>But I'm not
gonna let that happen.</i>

706
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:55,965
<i>
Every time I looked down,
she was just in the water,</i>

707
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,758
<i>- sitting there.
- She was in the water,
and, like...</i>

708
00:33:57,862 --> 00:34:00,413
I'm pissed, because I would
have kept this leg on.

709
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:03,000
And I, like,
I would have been able to lift.

710
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:05,965
And also, when Cody said
that was all of our faults

711
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:07,517
that the puzzle piece
was in the bag.

712
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,275
<i>- She grabbed the bag.
- Especially, yeah.</i>

713
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,137
- That's your responsibility.
- Yeah.

714
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:14,137
<i>Nneka has been
great around camp,</i>

715
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:16,344
but judging
by this challenge, um,

716
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,137
I just feel like every time
I was looking at her,

717
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:21,068
<i>she's wasn't really
pulling her weight.</i>

718
00:34:23,482 --> 00:34:25,965
- I don't know.
- Yeah, we need
to talk to the boys.

719
00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:27,724
Yeah. We need
to talk to everybody.

720
00:34:27,827 --> 00:34:30,103
<i>Nneka does contribute
a lot around camp,</i>

721
00:34:30,206 --> 00:34:32,172
<i>but we just need to think
what's gonna get us</i>

722
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:34,000
<i>further in this game.</i>

723
00:34:34,103 --> 00:34:36,068
And voting out Nneka
is probably the best way

724
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:37,758
<i>to keep the tribe strong.</i>

725
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:51,103
- Oh.
- We know what that means.
All right. Well...

726
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:56,034
<i>
After the challenge,
it was a very different vibe.</i>

727
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:59,931
I mean, we've had a good kumbaya
thing going in the tribe,

728
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:02,206
<i>but today, people talk to you,</i>

729
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,068
<i>they're not making eye contact.</i>

730
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:05,586
<i>And I'm not surprised,</i>

731
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,517
<i>because I did not do well
in the challenge.</i>

732
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,586
<i>So there is a chance
that it could be me tonight.</i>

733
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:16,758
Talking about
the stupid challenge

734
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:19,862
and the other tribes probably
eating freaking fish tonight.

735
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:23,517
<i>
However, Cody and I
are super close,</i>

736
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,068
<i>and Jesse and I have
been getting along really well.</i>

737
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:29,241
<i>So hopefully the relationships
I've built in this game</i>

738
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,206
<i>are something I can count on.</i>

739
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:47,379
<i>
Oh, my God.
It feels amazing to win.</i>

740
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:50,379
Not only did we win immunity,
but it was a reward challenge,

741
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,862
<i>so we won fishing gear.</i>

742
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:54,689
Oh, my God! There's two.

743
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:58,586
<i>
Which is so crucial,
because the entire tribe</i>

744
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,000
<i>has not been eating
anything but coconuts.</i>

745
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:04,310
So to be able to get a different
source of protein is invaluable.

746
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,586
- I'm so proud of us.
- I'm-I'm so proud of us.
- You guys...

747
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:09,379
I was actually in shock.

748
00:36:09,482 --> 00:36:11,413
And then it hit me,
and I was like,

749
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:12,827
"Aah!"

750
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:15,068
<i>I feel really proud of myself.</i>

751
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,896
<i>It makes me a little tearful,
like...</i>

752
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,965
I did that,
and that was something that

753
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:20,655
came from my brain, and...

754
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,689
I underestimate that a lot.

755
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:26,310
<i>Growing up,
I had ADHD and I had dyslexia.</i>

756
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:28,586
<i>And so before I was diagnosed,</i>

757
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:32,310
<i>teachers just assumed that
I was lazy and didn't care.</i>

758
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:35,172
I would get one of those timed
quizzes sit in front of me,

759
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:37,758
and I would freeze up so bad,
I just couldn't think.

760
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,103
I would only answer,
like, two or three questions.

761
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:42,896
And, you know, we have to swap
and grade each other's papers.

762
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,896
And the person next to me
always knew how bad I had done.

763
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,827
<i>And that kind of talk
gets around quickly.</i>

764
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:51,482
<i>So I grew up being told
I was dumb--</i>

765
00:36:51,586 --> 00:36:54,620
by my teachers, by the people
who are supposed to help you.

766
00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:57,655
Basically everybody but my mom
and dad told me that I was

767
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,931
not going anywhere
and that I couldn't do

768
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:03,448
the things that I wanted to do.
And so, it takes

769
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:05,758
<i>an experience like this
to really shed that.</i>

770
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:10,172
<i>A doctoral degree couldn't even
shed me of this feeling</i>

771
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:14,103
<i>that I'm not smart enough.
But today,</i>

772
00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:15,586
I looked at that puzzle,
and I was like,

773
00:37:15,689 --> 00:37:18,310
"Dang, girl, you're bright."

774
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:21,241
Have you guys worked
with that gear before?

775
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:22,586
- The-the spear and the...
- A spear?

776
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:24,862
- No.
- Oh, I have an idea.

777
00:37:24,965 --> 00:37:27,034
Do you want to tie
a really long rope around it?

778
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:29,068
We don't need that.
I'm gonna be holding on to it.

779
00:37:29,172 --> 00:37:30,758
If we're just walking out there,
I can hold on to it.

780
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:32,689
- We're just gonna be
holding on to this...
- Also, it's...

781
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,586
- You're gonna hold on to...
No, for when you release it.
- So that's...

782
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:36,793
- when you release it.
- That you can catch it...

783
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,551
- without having to,
without having to cut it short.
- We can shoot it into the sand.

784
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:39,827
Shoot it into the sand.

785
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:41,103
All right,
do whatever you want to do.

786
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:44,034
<i>Gabler has some
spearfishing experience,</i>

787
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,586
which I very much appreciate.

788
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:48,655
All right, bud, let's go see
what we can get into.

789
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:56,413
However, he has not
ever used a Hawaiian sling.

790
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,551
There it is. One short one.

791
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:07,034
Like that.

792
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:15,206
This guy
you swing around like this.

793
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,965
You guys are ready
for your fish.

794
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,724
It's a big, blue frickin' ocean
out there.

795
00:38:23,758 --> 00:38:25,827
<i>When I think of
soaring off into oblivion</i>

796
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:30,413
and completely misses the fish,
we might be out a spear.

797
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:36,103
Wow.

798
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:39,344
Good news is
next Tribal we have to go to

799
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:40,931
we don't have to
deal with that idol.

800
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:43,000
- I'm just, I...
- I think that it's invalid now.

801
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:44,413
- Oh, yeah. I think so. Yeah.
- But we're just trying,

802
00:38:44,517 --> 00:38:46,275
but we're trying to verify that.

803
00:38:46,379 --> 00:38:48,758
<i>
A big topic of discussion
has been whether or not</i>

804
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:52,724
Gabler's idol expires after
the first two Tribal Councils

805
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:57,068
in the game or after Gabler's
first two Tribal Councils.

806
00:38:57,172 --> 00:38:59,413
We want to look at the clue
again without being weird

807
00:38:59,517 --> 00:39:00,689
and being like,
"Can we read your clue?"

808
00:39:00,793 --> 00:39:02,034
It said the next
two Tribal Councils...

809
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,758
But are you sure?

810
00:39:03,862 --> 00:39:05,482
I am sure that's what it said.

811
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:08,379
<i>
We were hoping
that after tonight,</i>

812
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:10,793
even though we're not
going to Tribal Council,

813
00:39:10,896 --> 00:39:14,379
that the immunity idol
that he had would expire.

814
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:20,724
<i>Okay.</i>

815
00:39:20,827 --> 00:39:23,482
<i>I always thought it was so wack</i>

816
00:39:23,586 --> 00:39:25,551
when people went through
each other's bags on <i>Survivor.</i>

817
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,103
I thought it was just
lying, cheating,

818
00:39:27,206 --> 00:39:29,172
<i>you know, unfair.</i>

819
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:32,965
<i>But it's so different coming
here, understanding that</i>

820
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:34,448
those are necessary deeds.

821
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:42,793
- Hey, Owen.
- Yes, sir.

822
00:39:42,896 --> 00:39:45,206
Do we have any coconut left?

823
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,827
There's a tiny bit on there.

824
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:48,344
Okay, cool.

825
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,586
Hopefully this is
the last of this I eat.

826
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,517
I don't like it, man.
I thought I'd like coconut more.

827
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,724
In my daily life, I don't lie,

828
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,689
<i>I don't cheat.
I really am an honest person.</i>

829
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:01,724
<i>But everything changes
when you're in this game,</i>

830
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:04,517
<i>because anything you can do
to give yourself an advantage</i>

831
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,758
is fair game.

832
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:08,206
Oh, it was in that shell thing.

833
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,655
- It was in the shell?
- That's where

834
00:40:09,758 --> 00:40:11,551
the idol itself was.
I'm, like,

835
00:40:11,655 --> 00:40:14,482
95% confident
it's no good anymore.

836
00:40:15,517 --> 00:40:16,517
I found it.

837
00:40:18,448 --> 00:40:19,482
Okay.

838
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,448
Okay.

839
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:28,896
- Obviously, it's still good.
- After that, it loses all power.

840
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,241
- So he still has to stay around
for the next one.
- Okay.

841
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:33,172
- Okay. Yeah.
- It's good we read it.

842
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:34,931
<i>I have confirmed my worst fear</i>

843
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:37,965
<i>that Gabler's idol
is still in play.</i>

844
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,172
<i>So that complicates things,
because if he plays his idol--</i>

845
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,896
<i>which I think
we have to assume he will--</i>

846
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,448
and he throws my name out,
I'm gone.

847
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:05,172
<i>
Our game plan right now
is to get Nneka out.</i>

848
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:06,586
<i>We know that
Dwight doesn't have a vote,</i>

849
00:41:06,689 --> 00:41:09,000
<i>so obviously
Jesse is a key person here,</i>

850
00:41:09,103 --> 00:41:11,862
<i>because if Jesse is with us
and Nneka plays</i>

851
00:41:11,965 --> 00:41:14,413
<i>her Shot in the Dark,
we can split our votes on Cody.</i>

852
00:41:14,517 --> 00:41:16,689
<i>I've always gotten
really good vibes from Jesse.</i>

853
00:41:16,793 --> 00:41:18,965
<i>I feel like he's being
genuine with us,</i>

854
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:21,137
<i>but there is that little
inkling in the back of your head</i>

855
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:25,034
of, like, how do I know
100% that you're actually

856
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:27,413
on our side, and we're
not the ones getting played?

857
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,517
<i>
While Nneka might be a challenge
liability going forward,</i>

858
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,068
<i>I think Justine
is a bigger threat to my game.</i>

859
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:53,241
She seems smart,
She seems calculating,

860
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,103
and like Cody said, "You can
never trust a salesperson."

861
00:41:56,206 --> 00:41:59,000
<i>But also, the other day,
she just openly told me</i>

862
00:41:59,103 --> 00:42:00,413
<i>that she's really good at lying.</i>

863
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:03,206
We need to come up
with a decoy to tell 'em.

864
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,241
I'll talk to Nneka.

865
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,586
<i>I'll do some acting.</i>

866
00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:10,620
- I have a good, like,
lying face.

867
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:11,758
I can keep a straight face.

868
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,724
<i>
I mean, she's scary.</i>

869
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,275
So I've always got,
like, this stereotype of...

870
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:22,793
Yeah.

871
00:42:22,896 --> 00:42:25,931
<i>Justine's a threat.
Like, she seems sort of lethal.</i>

872
00:42:26,034 --> 00:42:29,206
<i>So I think voting out Justine
right now is the right move,</i>

873
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,965
<i>but I really want to get on
the same page with Dwight.</i>

874
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:38,689
- Me and you,
I-I feel like we're tight.
- Yeah.

875
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:40,310
Think we're solid like that.

876
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:42,620
And I think, like, we're in
the middle of these two pairs.

877
00:42:42,724 --> 00:42:45,000
- Yeah.
- And we have to figure out
which way is best.

878
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:47,413
No, no, no, no...

879
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:56,620
Uh-huh.

880
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,448
Yeah.

881
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:04,448
So...

882
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:11,241
...is Justine
is a little bit scary to me.

883
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:13,172
- I'm not gonna lie to you.
She's a little bit scary.
- Yeah.

884
00:43:13,275 --> 00:43:15,000
Like, earlier,
she was telling me, she's like,

885
00:43:15,103 --> 00:43:17,275
she's like,
"I'm really good at lying."

886
00:43:17,379 --> 00:43:20,551
And I was like, "What?
Why would you say that to me?"

887
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:21,551
And that's what scares me.

888
00:43:21,655 --> 00:43:22,689
So...

889
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,172
- I-I...
- Cody is, honestly,

890
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:28,586
he's like, "Oh, Dwight is, like,
solid. He's great."

891
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,965
<i>So I run the idea
of voting Justine off to Dwight,</i>

892
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:34,551
<i>and he wasn't too receptive.</i>

893
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:36,758
I could just get the vibes
that he didn't want to do that.

894
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:39,379
<i>He still wanted to sort of
work with the girls,</i>

895
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:42,137
which is kind of troubling
to me, because, you know,

896
00:43:42,241 --> 00:43:44,137
then he has
these other options, right?

897
00:43:44,241 --> 00:43:46,344
<i>But the thing is,
he doesn't have a vote.</i>

898
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:48,000
So is there any way for you...

899
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:50,206
- Spiders.

900
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,310
Yeah...

901
00:43:53,448 --> 00:43:54,862
- How are you guys?
- We're good.

902
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:55,862
- Yeah.
- I mean...

903
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:57,793
<i>Nneka thinks it's her.</i>

904
00:43:57,896 --> 00:44:00,655
<i>- Uh-huh.
- I mean,
that's who I'm voting.</i>

905
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:03,103
But how do we know

906
00:44:03,206 --> 00:44:05,689
that you're not playing us?

907
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:07,344
You're the swing vote here.

908
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:09,413
I just want to know.

909
00:44:14,241 --> 00:44:15,655
You're good. You're good.

910
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:17,137
- I swear.
- We've been
walking all day...

911
00:44:18,068 --> 00:44:19,310
Yeah.

912
00:44:19,413 --> 00:44:20,965
<i>The fact that she came up to me</i>

913
00:44:21,068 --> 00:44:23,413
and was like, "I don't know
if I trust you, pretty much."

914
00:44:23,517 --> 00:44:26,000
Like, that for me,
I got to take that out.

915
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:28,344
I can't have that.
 I really can't.

916
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:31,068
<i>I would like to sort of
be on the same page as Dwight,</i>

917
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:33,827
<i>but if push comes to shove,
I'm gonna do what's best for me.</i>

918
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:34,931
The plan is Nneka?

919
00:44:35,034 --> 00:44:37,172
- Yeah. Do you guys agree?
- Yeah.

920
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:39,551
<i>Jesse really wants
to vote out Justine,</i>

921
00:44:39,655 --> 00:44:41,034
<i>but that's not what I want.</i>

922
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,206
<i>I feel like,
with Justine and Noelle here,</i>

923
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,310
I have a lot more options
going forward.

924
00:44:46,413 --> 00:44:48,793
<i>I have no vote.
I really have no say in this,</i>

925
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:51,275
<i>but we have
to keep the tribe strong.</i>

926
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:54,862
<i>So, unfortunately,
Nneka needs to go.</i>

927
00:45:03,275 --> 00:45:05,034
Justine is worried
that it's between you and her.

928
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:08,344
So she has an inkling that
we're going after her as well.

929
00:45:15,827 --> 00:45:17,413
- J-U-S-T-I-N-E?
- Yes.

930
00:45:17,517 --> 00:45:18,896
- Yes.
- Okay.

931
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,620
- Hey, man,
spelling wasn't my best.

932
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:26,137
My standardized score in, like,
vocabulary and English

933
00:45:26,241 --> 00:45:28,724
- was quite low.

934
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:30,275
<i>
We got it all settled.
We're all good.</i>

935
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:33,206
<i>We're just ready to go
to Tribal and vote out Justine.</i>

936
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,689
And I decide to take
a little bit of a walk,

937
00:45:35,793 --> 00:45:37,551
'cause <i>Survivor.</i> Why not?

938
00:45:37,655 --> 00:45:39,137
<i>Got nothing else to do.</i>

939
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:41,310
<i>Plus, it'd be nice
to have an idol.</i>

940
00:45:43,862 --> 00:45:45,103
<i>My eyes are peeled.</i>

941
00:45:45,206 --> 00:45:46,241
<i>I think I'm good
at that kind of stuff.</i>

942
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:47,827
<i>Always have been.</i>

943
00:45:47,931 --> 00:45:49,310
<i>I used to go hunting
for night crawlers at night.</i>

944
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,931
<i>So we'd go fishing.
Mushroom hunting in the spring.</i>

945
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:55,620
<i>Easter egg hunting as a kid.
I was a legend at it.</i>

946
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,310
Just bird doo-doo.

947
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:02,448
<i>But this looks easier on TV.</i>

948
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,793
<i>That's for sure.</i>

949
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:08,448
<i>I haven't looked for an idol
because I believe that</i>

950
00:46:08,551 --> 00:46:09,896
<i>that is a kiss of death.</i>

951
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,620
<i>But we're
going to Tribal Council,</i>

952
00:46:11,724 --> 00:46:13,862
<i>and that changes everything.</i>

953
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,517
<i>I'm walking around forever,
and I'm finding nothing.</i>

954
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,448
<i>And I'm about to say
"to hell with it."</i>

955
00:46:27,344 --> 00:46:30,000
<i>And then I walk up to this,
like, stump,</i>

956
00:46:30,103 --> 00:46:32,620
<i>and bingo. I got it.</i>

957
00:46:43,655 --> 00:46:45,620
<i>And I was like, "Holy moly."</i>

958
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:46,965
I was so stoked.

959
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:49,413
<i>I saw season 41 and 42,</i>

960
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:52,413
<i>but the L-I-V-I-N that was
tattooed on me is in my blood,</i>

961
00:46:52,517 --> 00:46:54,965
<i>so, like, the "beware" part,
like, it didn't even exist.</i>

962
00:46:55,068 --> 00:46:56,965
<i>Like, I just said, "Open it."</i>

963
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:36,551
<i>Tonight was a slam dunk,</i>

964
00:47:36,655 --> 00:47:39,034
<i>we were ready to rock,
and now</i>

965
00:47:39,137 --> 00:47:41,241
this leaves both me and Dwight
without a vote.

966
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:45,206
<i>So, Justine and Noelle
are voting for Nneka.</i>

967
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:48,827
<i>And Nneka and Jesse
will be voting for Justine.</i>

968
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:51,310
Tie. Fantastic.

969
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,689
... just got crazy.

970
00:48:15,965 --> 00:48:19,344
<i>
Opening up the Beware Advantage
was a huge mistake,</i>

971
00:48:19,448 --> 00:48:21,551
<i>because if I don't get
a specific bead</i>

972
00:48:21,655 --> 00:48:24,862
<i>off of each person's bag,
I don't have a vote.</i>

973
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:26,551
<i>And we'd guarantee
gonna a tie.</i>

974
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:28,758
I need to go get my stuff
that was drying.

975
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:30,551
I'm gonna hang mine up.

976
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:34,310
<i>And getting these beads from
my tribemates is going to be</i>

977
00:48:34,413 --> 00:48:35,896
damn near impossible,

978
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,620
because they're all superfans,

979
00:48:37,724 --> 00:48:39,862
and these things
are like gold to them.

980
00:48:39,965 --> 00:48:42,206
Like, the whole <i>
Survivor</i> experience--

981
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,689
<i>the bags, the water bottles--
are like gold.</i>

982
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:47,034
<i>And there's minutes
left on the clock.</i>

983
00:48:47,137 --> 00:48:49,517
<i>So I got to talk to Jesse.</i>

984
00:49:01,551 --> 00:49:03,068
And I lost...

985
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,241
How am I gonna
convince anybody?

986
00:49:15,896 --> 00:49:18,172
- I can get yours.
- Yeah, you can get mine.

987
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:20,413
<i>For sure. Yeah, yeah, no...</i>

988
00:49:20,517 --> 00:49:21,862
But then Dwight's,
like, all about it.

989
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,620
I shouldn't have grabbed it.
It was so stupid.

990
00:49:28,724 --> 00:49:29,931
We were set just perfect.

991
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:32,517
<i>
Cody found the Beware Advantage</i>

992
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,896
<i>and he just opened it,
right before Tribal.</i>

993
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I don't know if he hasn't seen,
like, season 41 or season 42

994
00:49:39,103 --> 00:49:40,482
or something, but,
like, you know

995
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:43,724
you're gonna lose your vote
unless you do something.

996
00:49:46,448 --> 00:49:48,241
<i>It's absolute panic.</i>

997
00:49:48,344 --> 00:49:49,689
You got people losing
their votes, people who didn't

998
00:49:49,793 --> 00:49:50,862
have their votes to begin with.

999
00:49:50,965 --> 00:49:52,586
<i>It's just chaos right now.</i>

1000
00:50:10,379 --> 00:50:12,241
Guys think I should
wear my hat tonight?

1001
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:15,551
- Absolutely.
- Right?

1002
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:17,068
Like, really ... rip it.

1003
00:50:17,172 --> 00:50:19,103
- It'd be a legend move.
- Yeah.

1004
00:50:19,206 --> 00:50:20,275
Palm frond hat.

1005
00:50:23,034 --> 00:50:25,034
It'll pop, you know?

1006
00:50:29,551 --> 00:50:31,931
That'll be beautiful on here,
you know?

1007
00:50:33,862 --> 00:50:35,172
I want to connect it.

1008
00:50:38,344 --> 00:50:39,931
Sweet.

1009
00:50:40,034 --> 00:50:42,034
- I'll put it right there.

1010
00:50:42,137 --> 00:50:45,172
Maybe, like, weave it
into the palm fronds.

1011
00:50:47,896 --> 00:50:49,896
Can I have yours off your bag
to wrap it around?

1012
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,758
Sure. I'm not gonna
do anything with it.

1013
00:50:57,068 --> 00:50:59,000
You can take my beads
off of my bag.

1014
00:51:00,172 --> 00:51:01,448
Yeah, you can take mine off.

1015
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:03,551
<i>
Immediately, Justine--</i>

1016
00:51:03,655 --> 00:51:06,000
<i>who doesn't know she's on the
chopping block-- was like,</i>

1017
00:51:06,103 --> 00:51:08,620
"Yeah, you can have mine, too."
I'm like, "Whoa.

1018
00:51:08,724 --> 00:51:10,620
This is actually working."

1019
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:18,068
- Hey, Dwight?
- What's up?

1020
00:51:18,172 --> 00:51:19,896
You want to put your beads
in this?

1021
00:51:22,827 --> 00:51:25,655
Dwight, you should give Cody
the beads from your bag.

1022
00:51:25,758 --> 00:51:27,068
From my bag?

1023
00:51:27,172 --> 00:51:28,551
He's trying to string it
all around.

1024
00:51:28,655 --> 00:51:30,172
All around?

1025
00:51:30,275 --> 00:51:31,586
I don't know. I mean...

1026
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:32,758
Oh, come on.

1027
00:51:32,862 --> 00:51:34,689
All right.

1028
00:51:38,758 --> 00:51:40,068
<i>
I thought that Dwight was</i>

1029
00:51:40,172 --> 00:51:41,068
gonna be very difficult,

1030
00:51:41,172 --> 00:51:42,103
<i>but he took it</i>

1031
00:51:42,206 --> 00:51:43,241
<i>right off his bag.</i>

1032
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:46,689
Aw, that's awesome.

1033
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:47,827
Of course.

1034
00:51:48,793 --> 00:51:49,827
Mm-hmm?

1035
00:51:58,931 --> 00:52:01,034
'Cause. I think they're cool.

1036
00:52:01,137 --> 00:52:02,586
Pretty.

1037
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:05,172
I made a bracelet.

1038
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:09,000
<i>
Noelle-- there's no way she's
parting with any of this stuff.</i>

1039
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:10,965
So I'm freaking.

1040
00:52:11,068 --> 00:52:13,862
I feel like an actual castaway
on <i>Survivor</i>

1041
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,793
with my <i>Survivor</i> beads.

1042
00:52:16,827 --> 00:52:18,482
<i>
There are so many moving pieces.</i>

1043
00:52:18,586 --> 00:52:20,379
<i>The sun's setting.
Tribal's upon us.</i>

1044
00:52:20,482 --> 00:52:22,689
<i>I mean,
this new game of</i> Survivor--

1045
00:52:22,793 --> 00:52:25,758
it's just
absolute freaking chaos.

1046
00:52:26,758 --> 00:52:27,793
Yeah.

1047
00:52:29,586 --> 00:52:31,413
<i>
I mean, there's so many
different possibilities</i>

1048
00:52:31,517 --> 00:52:33,793
<i>for this Tribal, so we
got to be ready for anything,</i>

1049
00:52:33,896 --> 00:52:35,241
<i>because it's gonna be crazy.</i>

1050
00:53:02,206 --> 00:53:04,758
Behind you are some torches.
Everybody grab a torch.

1051
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:07,068
Dip it in and get fire.

1052
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:14,793
This is part of the ritual
of Tribal Council,

1053
00:53:14,896 --> 00:53:17,655
because in this game,
as you know,

1054
00:53:17,758 --> 00:53:19,275
fire represents your life.

1055
00:53:19,379 --> 00:53:21,586
And when your fire is gone,
so are you. And as much as

1056
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:25,172
I hate for any of you to leave,
that's the stakes.

1057
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:28,551
Did you feel that, Cody,
when you got back to camp--

1058
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:31,034
that realization that it's on?

1059
00:53:31,137 --> 00:53:32,586
"One of us
is going home tonight."

1060
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:34,827
Oh, automatic. Guarantee.

1061
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:37,275
I mean, two days ago, we won
our first immunity challenge,

1062
00:53:37,379 --> 00:53:40,068
and we had dropped
into the wave of our lifetime.

1063
00:53:40,172 --> 00:53:41,931
And we rode it up until today.

1064
00:53:42,034 --> 00:53:45,275
And unfortunately, someone
is going to wipe out tonight

1065
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:47,931
and have a end
to their <i>Survivor</i> story.

1066
00:53:48,034 --> 00:53:50,862
Cody, got to ask:
did you weave these palm fronds,

1067
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:52,310
- this hat?
- Yeah.

1068
00:53:52,413 --> 00:53:54,034
Learned it from the uncles
that sell 'em to tourists

1069
00:53:54,137 --> 00:53:55,862
- on, uh, the island of Oahu.
- For real?

1070
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,517
- Absolutely.
- Huh.

1071
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,655
So, figuring that today
could be my last day,

1072
00:54:00,758 --> 00:54:02,448
I wanted to rock it and, uh,
give the people what they want,

1073
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:04,448
show 'em this beautiful hat.

1074
00:54:04,551 --> 00:54:06,448
And with the help
of my tribe, we, uh...

1075
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:09,448
you know, made it real nice and
fancy and put some beads on it.

1076
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:11,000
It's pretty impressive.

1077
00:54:11,103 --> 00:54:12,931
- Oh, yeah.
- It's like
a full-on visor.

1078
00:54:13,034 --> 00:54:15,241
And I actually am
very down for a hat.

1079
00:54:15,344 --> 00:54:18,034
Like, today I was squinting
in the sun. I wish I had a hat.

1080
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:20,724
So, Cody, what will it take for
you to make a hat for Justine?

1081
00:54:20,827 --> 00:54:22,793
I mean,

1082
00:54:22,896 --> 00:54:25,379
it's gonna have to take
for her to stay for another day,

1083
00:54:25,482 --> 00:54:27,413
and, uh, unfortunately,

1084
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:30,689
I don't have that sole power
to do so. It-it's a tribe thing.

1085
00:54:30,793 --> 00:54:33,620
And, um, whoever goes home,
I'll be happy to get you a hat.

1086
00:54:33,724 --> 00:54:35,310
- I can promise you that.

1087
00:54:35,413 --> 00:54:36,517
Wow.

1088
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,517
Just a simple comment
about a hat.

1089
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,379
And then Cody has to say,
"Great.

1090
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:42,310
If you survive,
I'll make you one."

1091
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:44,620
Yeah, I mean, I personally know

1092
00:54:44,724 --> 00:54:46,241
that tonight
could be my last night.

1093
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:48,034
- Based on what?
- Well,

1094
00:54:48,137 --> 00:54:49,827
Noelle and I
hit it off immediately,

1095
00:54:49,931 --> 00:54:51,275
so that puts us two together.

1096
00:54:51,379 --> 00:54:54,758
Dwight and Jesse are kind of in,
you know, no-man's-land.

1097
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,896
We don't really know
where they stand at this point.

1098
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,482
And then it really seems
like Nneka and Cody

1099
00:55:00,586 --> 00:55:02,206
have been hitting it off
as well. So it kind of

1100
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,586
breaks our six up into two,
two and two.

1101
00:55:04,689 --> 00:55:06,724
- Hmm.
- But I think
that the strongest two

1102
00:55:06,827 --> 00:55:08,827
that we know are together
are Nneka and Cody.

1103
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:12,103
And on top of that, I'm the only
person that hasn't really

1104
00:55:12,206 --> 00:55:14,310
talked game or strategy
with Cody.

1105
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:17,103
So I think that puts
an extra target on my back.

1106
00:55:17,206 --> 00:55:18,586
Okay, so, Dwight,

1107
00:55:18,689 --> 00:55:20,206
this is what I just heard
Justine say.

1108
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,172
Her and Noelle are paired.

1109
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:24,551
She thinks Cody and Nneka
seem to be hitting it off,

1110
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,275
but you two-- they don't
know if you're together

1111
00:55:26,379 --> 00:55:28,344
or you're both lost
or you haven't figured out

1112
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:30,310
- what you're doing.
Is that what you just heard?
- Yeah, I'm not sure.

1113
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:31,310
Are we together now?

1114
00:55:32,724 --> 00:55:34,551
- You want to make this official?
- Absolutely.

1115
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,448
Thank you so much, sir.

1116
00:55:36,551 --> 00:55:39,241
- We're together now. Um...
- So wait, is that real?

1117
00:55:39,344 --> 00:55:41,068
Are there three pairs?

1118
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:44,482
Um, the strategy talks,
up until this afternoon,

1119
00:55:44,586 --> 00:55:45,931
have been very limited.

1120
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:47,310
It also has kind of been
difficult for me,

1121
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:49,137
because I think
it's common knowledge here,

1122
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:50,620
I got on the boat day two,

1123
00:55:50,724 --> 00:55:52,241
and I lost my vote
in a decision.

1124
00:55:52,344 --> 00:55:54,655
So it's kind of been difficult
for me to have strategy talk

1125
00:55:54,758 --> 00:55:55,965
if I don't actually have

1126
00:55:56,068 --> 00:55:57,862
a concrete say
in this Tribal Council.

1127
00:55:57,965 --> 00:55:59,793
How does everybody know
you don't have a vote?

1128
00:55:59,896 --> 00:56:02,137
I came back and I was
very honest with my tribe,

1129
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:04,482
told them what kind of
decision I made, lost my vote.

1130
00:56:04,586 --> 00:56:06,379
And I got to live
with the consequences of that.

1131
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:09,241
Jesse, I'm sure you
think this at times,

1132
00:56:09,344 --> 00:56:10,241
when you watch the show.

1133
00:56:10,344 --> 00:56:12,000
I hear it all the time.

1134
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:15,413
"Probst, why does everybody
tell everybody everything?"

1135
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:18,586
And I try to explain
that it's about currency,

1136
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:20,862
and trust is really
the only currency you have.

1137
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:23,172
Is that what it is for you,
as well?

1138
00:56:23,275 --> 00:56:24,724
Yeah, I think that's the case.

1139
00:56:24,827 --> 00:56:27,344
I mean, back at home, like,
when, you know, I'm trying

1140
00:56:27,448 --> 00:56:29,241
to sort of, like, build
relationships with people--

1141
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,931
which aren't very many.

1142
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:32,965
Again, it's just me,
my wife and kids.

1143
00:56:33,068 --> 00:56:36,241
But, like, in social settings,
I will, you know, go one-on-one

1144
00:56:36,344 --> 00:56:37,793
and, like, share my background
with people.

1145
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:39,241
I will tell people, you know,

1146
00:56:39,344 --> 00:56:42,103
that I did get jumped
into a gang as a teenager.

1147
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:44,551
It's about sort of building
trust and, like, opening

1148
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:47,103
that door, and I think when
you're authentic with people,

1149
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:49,137
they're authentic back.

1150
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,931
Nneka, when you watch <i>Survivor,</i>
do you ever scratch your head

1151
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,344
at why players share all their

1152
00:56:54,448 --> 00:56:57,103
advantages or disadvantages?

1153
00:56:57,206 --> 00:57:00,172
Jeff, have you hung out
with Nigerians at all?

1154
00:57:00,275 --> 00:57:02,172
We are, like, ultra-passionate.

1155
00:57:02,275 --> 00:57:05,172
You need to see us watch <i>
Survivor</i> at home sometimes.

1156
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:06,724
Like, we will be
on the coffee table,

1157
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:09,379
screaming at the TV.

1158
00:57:09,482 --> 00:57:10,965
"No, I should've done this.
No, I shouldn't have done this.

1159
00:57:11,068 --> 00:57:12,586
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

1160
00:57:12,689 --> 00:57:14,344
Like, "You know what?
I'm gonna go on <i>Survivor.</i>

1161
00:57:14,448 --> 00:57:16,034
I'll show you all."

1162
00:57:18,896 --> 00:57:20,000
So, Nneka, Dwight brought up,

1163
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,172
"Hey, I went out.
I lost my vote."

1164
00:57:22,275 --> 00:57:24,310
Did that open the gates
for everybody to have

1165
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:26,586
a discussion about whether
or not there's other advantages

1166
00:57:26,689 --> 00:57:28,172
or idols that
might be in the game?

1167
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:31,068
Um, no, I think that,
on the one hand, yes,

1168
00:57:31,172 --> 00:57:32,931
maybe there's an idol
for this season.

1169
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:35,379
But if we look at
the last couple of seasons,

1170
00:57:35,482 --> 00:57:37,620
like the Beware Advantage,
you want to think, like,

1171
00:57:37,724 --> 00:57:40,275
"Okay, if I find this,
will it really help me right now

1172
00:57:40,379 --> 00:57:42,206
"or is it something that
will get your hands tied

1173
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:43,482
in whatever way?"

1174
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:45,103
And that's just a tough part,

1175
00:57:45,206 --> 00:57:47,896
because you just never know
if there even is an advantage

1176
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,620
or an idol
on our island, because,

1177
00:57:49,724 --> 00:57:52,103
unless everybody's lying to me,
nobody's sharing.

1178
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:54,034
So they're either
playing a really great game

1179
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,241
or nobody actually
has found anything.

1180
00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:59,206
So, Cody, what kind of impact
does that

1181
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,965
have, knowing one
of only six players

1182
00:58:02,068 --> 00:58:04,103
says they won't
be voting tonight?

1183
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:05,344
It's enormous. I mean,

1184
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:08,068
not having a vote
can break up an alliance.

1185
00:58:08,172 --> 00:58:09,931
You know, Dwight doing that.

1186
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:11,344
Well, they only got one vote,
you know?

1187
00:58:11,448 --> 00:58:12,862
It makes an easy target.

1188
00:58:12,965 --> 00:58:16,758
But hopefully for him
or Jesse or whoever else here,

1189
00:58:16,862 --> 00:58:19,379
it's not gonna be
the-the dagger in the back

1190
00:58:19,482 --> 00:58:21,586
that really
causes them to go home.

1191
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:23,517
And that's
a tough decision because

1192
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,000
not one person has done
anything wrong on this tribe.

1193
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:28,172
Nobody deserves
to be going home tonight.

1194
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:30,413
But then, on the other hand, we
need to keep the tribe strong.

1195
00:58:30,517 --> 00:58:33,517
We need to be winning
these next immunity challenges,

1196
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,241
because I don't want
to be sitting here again.

1197
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:37,827
Jesse, that really gets at

1198
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,068
the heart of where the game is
for each player,

1199
00:58:41,172 --> 00:58:43,482
and that is,
"I care about tribe strength.

1200
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,000
I don't want
to lose another challenge."

1201
00:58:45,103 --> 00:58:48,000
Or, "I just need to make sure
my alliance is strong

1202
00:58:48,103 --> 00:58:49,689
and as long as I'm here,
I'm good with that."

1203
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:52,172
Yeah, I mean, I think that
it's a big dilemma.

1204
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:54,448
I can't say, like,
which one is more important.

1205
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:56,620
I think that's
a really hard thing to decide.

1206
00:58:56,724 --> 00:58:59,241
But we do develop
these relationships.

1207
00:58:59,344 --> 00:59:00,724
We have these emotions
that are involved,

1208
00:59:00,827 --> 00:59:02,586
but at the end of the day,
we do have to sort of

1209
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:05,620
set them aside
and-and play the game.

1210
00:59:08,689 --> 00:59:10,517
All right, it is time to vote.

1211
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,793
Justine, you're up.

1212
01:00:01,827 --> 01:00:03,000
I'll go tally the votes.

1213
01:00:23,379 --> 01:00:25,034
If anybody has
an advantage or an idol

1214
01:00:25,137 --> 01:00:26,172
and they want to play it,

1215
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:28,448
now would be
the time to do so.

1216
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:36,137
All right, I'll read the votes.

1217
01:00:39,517 --> 01:00:41,620
First vote: Justine.

1218
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:45,724
Nneka.

1219
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:52,689
Cody.

1220
01:00:52,793 --> 01:00:55,862
That's one vote Cody,
one vote Justine,

1221
01:00:55,965 --> 01:00:57,344
one vote Nneka.

1222
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:01,344
Justine.

1223
01:01:01,448 --> 01:01:03,965
Two votes Justine,
one vote Nneka,

1224
01:01:04,068 --> 01:01:06,586
one vote Cody,
one vote left.

1225
01:01:06,689 --> 01:01:10,137
<i>

was easily the most craziest</i>

1226
01:01:10,241 --> 01:01:12,000
emotional ride
I've ever been on.

1227
01:01:12,103 --> 01:01:13,172

1230

1231

Justine.

1232
01:01:27,793 --> 01:01:29,172
Need to bring me your torch.

1233
01:01:41,586 --> 01:01:44,000
Justine, the tribe has spoken.

1234
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:47,344
Time for you to go.

1235
01:01:48,344 --> 01:01:49,551
- Love you, girl.
- Love you, guys.

1236
01:01:49,655 --> 01:01:50,586
Love you.

1237
01:01:50,689 --> 01:01:52,103
- Bye, Justine.
- Bye.

1238
01:02:05,827 --> 01:02:07,689
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

1239
01:02:07,793 --> 01:02:08,896
