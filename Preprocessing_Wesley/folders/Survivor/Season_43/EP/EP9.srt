337
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:18,827
Yeah, I-I need to find people
that are willing to really

338
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:20,620
- work with me, because...
- Yeah.

339
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:22,517
- And we've already built trust.
- Yeah.

340
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,241
<i>CASSIDY:
This game never stops.</i>

341
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:25,620
<i>It is completely exhausting,</i>

342
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,344
and so it takes a lot
to keep that fight alive.

343
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:31,275
But, I mean, I'm not gonna
let that fight go out in me.

344
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:35,103
<i>Being on</i> Survivor
<i>is what I've dreamed about</i>

345
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:36,965
<i>since I was a little kid.</i>

346
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,448
<i>When it's really hard out here,</i>

347
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:42,965
<i>I draw strength
from my family and my brothers,</i>

348
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,689
<i>who are so proud of me
out here playing this game.</i>

349
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:48,137
And I draw
strength from my sister,

350
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,137
<i>who passed away
a couple years ago and...</i>

351
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,206
<i>[sniffles] grew up
watching the show with me.</i>

352
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,793
<i>I know that, like,
her spirit's with me.</i>

353
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:56,724
<i>And so, in moments like this,</i>

354
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:59,000
when I'm feeling
really down and depleted

355
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:01,275
and kind of a little bit scared,

356
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,275
<i>I always say a prayer
and I kiss my necklace.</i>

357
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,931
<i>It has my sister's ashes in it.</i>

358
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:10,000
<i>I'm out here for her,
to honor her,</i>

359
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,413
and that's why
I don't give up in this game.

360
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:15,827
<i>I am putting a lot of trust
in Cody and Jesse tonight</i>

361
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:18,827
<i>to vote Ryan out, but I've been
on the right side of the vote</i>

362
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:20,413
<i>for the entire game.</i>

363
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:21,965
And everybody
who's come after me in this game

364
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,379
I've sent home successfully,

365
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,344
<i>so I'm just hoping
that it's Ryan tonight.</i>

366
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:32,379
<i>KARLA: This is so surreal.</i>

367
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:34,172
<i>I'm really proud of myself.</i>

368
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,310
<i>Day-one Karla
would never believe this.</i>

369
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,034
<i>I won individual immunity.</i>

370
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:39,931
And it just
feels wonderful to kind of...

371
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,275
to be able to wear this,

372
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:42,758
- [grunts]
<i>- because it guarantees</i>

373
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:44,379
<i>that I make
it to the final eight.</i>

374
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:45,758
I'm a freaking badass.

375
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:47,931
- NOELLE: Welcome home.
- OWEN: Not a bad shelter.

376
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:50,482
<i>KARLA:
Jeff tells us that we have
to go over to the Vesi camp.</i>

377
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:52,827
So we're stuck at Vesi
until Tribal.

378
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:53,931
Great job, Karla.

379
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:55,103
- That was hard.
- Thank you.

380
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:56,827
NOELLE:
Great job, Karla.

381
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:01,793
[James chuckles]

382
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,551
<i>KARLA:
James is a crucial part
of my alliance,</i>

383
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,827
<i>and I know
he wants to vote out Owen.</i>

384
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:09,758
No, sorry. My-my thing is full.

385
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,586
<i>Owen isn't really
part of my alliance.</i>

386
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:13,275
<i>So tonight, I'm voting for Owen.</i>

387
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:15,000
<i>But I do have to be careful,</i>

388
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:17,034
<i>because once you have to vote
one person out of five,</i>

389
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,482
<i>that's when it gets dangerous.</i>

390
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:20,000
<i>So you better be ready
and hope that you</i>

391
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:22,310
can trust the group
that you are in.

392
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:23,448
So...

393
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,931
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.
- SAMI: Oh, yeah.

394
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:28,448
NOELLE:
I think he's gonna go for James.

395
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:29,793
- A hundred percent.
- KARLA: Yeah.

396
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:31,827
And he's gonna
try to sway me and you.

397
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:33,793
So we-we need to talk to him

398
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:35,862
and make sure that
he's feeling comfortable,

399
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:37,379
- so he doesn't
play Shot in the Dark.
- SAMI: Yeah.

400
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:38,896
- That's the biggest thing.
- SAMI: Yeah.

401
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,413
So, you good with that plan?

402
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:44,689
KARLA:
Makes sense to me.
I mean... Simple.

403
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:46,206
<i>Owen is gonna be going home,</i>

404
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,965
<i>and I think he knows
exactly what's about to happen.</i>

405
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,655
And that's-that's a really...

406
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:53,724
...crappy place to be in,
I think.

407
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:56,344
So what are you thinking?

408
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:59,068
I feel like it is what it is.

409
00:17:59,172 --> 00:18:01,172
OWEN:
So who are you voting for?

410
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:06,068
- Okay.
- I'm not trying to give you...

411
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,896
No. Like...

412
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,862
What am I supposed to do, James?

413
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:12,344
- I'm not...
- How else am I supposed to
prove that I can work with you?

414
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:13,931
- I did what you told me to do.
- So, so...

415
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:16,551
Two minutes before Tribal,
you told me to vote for Ryan.

416
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:18,068
- I ... voted for Ryan, dude.
- Right.

417
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,896
So, so, let's-let'’s calm...
Like, I'm, I get...

418
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,586
Don't tell me to ... calm down.

419
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:23,172
- I'm not telling you to... Bro.
- I did what you told me to do,

420
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:24,827
- and it
was the wrong thing to do.
- Hey. No, no, no.

421
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:26,241
- What am I supposed to believe?
- It was the right thing to do,

422
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:27,655
'cause that's
what we asked you to do.

423
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:30,310
<i>OWEN:
Who does this guy think he is?</i>

424
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:32,965
To me, he's implying
I am getting votes.

425
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:36,172
<i>It's this
mafioso-style bullcrap.</i>

426
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:37,344
- You know what
I'm saying? Like...
- Sure.

427
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:39,068
<i>And I'm just, I'm tired of it,</i>

428
00:18:39,172 --> 00:18:41,379
and I'm nearing
my breaking point.

429
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:42,586
So there's
nine people on the vote,

430
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,103
and you're just mad at me?

431
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,482
You're the one I talked to
two minutes before Tribal.

432
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,344
Sami was there, too.

433
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:51,103
You-- I said, "Tell me."

434
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:53,379
Sami was there, too, bro.
Like, so I'm saying...

435
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,965
You're the one who f...
Like, Sami and I were gonna go.

436
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,620
Who knows what he would
have told me if you hadn't

437
00:18:57,724 --> 00:18:59,655
butted your way
into that conversation.

438
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:02,689
You're...
So everything is my fault?

439
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:04,827
- Yeah. In my brain.
- Okay.

440
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:06,965
- So, so, so...
- I asked you
what I'm supposed to do.

441
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:08,862
- So, so...
- I did what you told me.

442
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:10,206
Everything's my fault.

443
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,758
- Ah, get over yourself.
- Hey, man, like...

444
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:14,689
- Everything's my fault.
- KARLA: Is this for real?

445
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:16,103
- OWEN: Yeah.
- KARLA: What happened?

446
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:17,655
Yesterday at the well,

447
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:19,310
I asked him right before Tribal,

448
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:22,689
I said, "If it's Jeanine, tell
me. I will vote for Jeanine."

449
00:19:22,793 --> 00:19:24,689
- And I told you Ryan.
- And he sold me Ryan.

450
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:26,689
And what did you do at the first
Tribal Council after the merge?

451
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,137
- Put my name down, right?
- Yeah.

452
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,620
What'd you do the next time?
Put my name down, right?

453
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:31,137
OWEN:
No, I put
Ryan's name down the next time.

454
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:32,517
You put my name down
the first time. Did you tell me

455
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,448
you put my name down
the first time you did it?

456
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:35,137
- No.
- What's worse?

457
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,931
- OWEN: No.
- What-what's worse?

458
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:39,931
- Like, on the scheme of things.
No, no, no.
- But you...

459
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:41,413
On the scheme of things,
what's worse?

460
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:43,448
Writing someone's name down
or telling them a vote?

461
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:47,137
- What?
- It's good.

462
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:48,655
<i>JAMES: Owen is upset
at his predicament,</i>

463
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:52,758
<i>but also mad at me, even though
he wrote my name down</i>

464
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,413
at two previous Tribal Councils.

465
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:56,241
The second the pressure hits,
you start cursing people out

466
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:58,344
and acting a little hissy fit.

467
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,689
I hate that stuff, yo.

468
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:01,275
I know.

469
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:02,551
Truth be told, I feel like
we should just go in there,

470
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:05,413
put the votes on Owen
and call it a day.

471
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:07,379
- Make it quick.
- Exactly.

472
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:08,862
I have no sympathy for the guy

473
00:20:08,965 --> 00:20:12,137

<i>We have this
five-five split Tribal Council,</i>

00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:43,068
<i>and right now,
it's between Ryan and Cassidy.</i>

482
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:44,689
<i>We only have a say in, like,</i>

these five people here.

484
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:48,413
But that's not to say that
these five people

485
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:51,068
don't have relationships back
at the other Tribal Council.

486
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:53,034
<i>So even though
it's only us five,</i>

487

489
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:57,517
And so, we have to
weigh that out.

490
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,896
Okay. So what are
the benefits of keeping

00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,206
They feel like she's
a part of their alliance,

501
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,068
and me and Cody have, you know,
voted with them twice now.

502
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:29,137
<i>But on the other hand, she's
super social, super strategic.</i>

503
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:30,827
<i>So that's
a little bit concerning.</i>

504
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:32,689
If we send Ryan home,

505
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,655
<i>we're sending
a challenge beast home,</i>

506
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,413
<i>which is good for me,</i>

507
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:40,137
<i>but Ryan isn't
a strategic threat. And so</i>

508
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:41,413
it's a tough one.

509
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:44,448
But also, here,
we have an advantage.

510
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:47,103
We have the advantage
of going to Tribal...

511
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,724
- after them.
- To know who, yeah.

512
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:51,137
JESSE:
So we will know
who's sitting there on the jury.

513
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:53,034
<i>But we also
have to consider, like,</i>

514
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,793
we're in the lucky position
of we get to see

515
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,379
who they send home.

516
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,379
And so that can
impact our decision, too.

517
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:03,068
If it is Owen, then maybe we'd
want to keep trust with James

518
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:05,896
and get rid of Ryan
and keep Cass.

519
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,172
You know what I'm saying?

520
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:10,793
If it's James,
maybe we just cut Cass,

521
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,172
because then
Karla's on her own completely.

522
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:14,275

530
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:29,310

532
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:34,000

533
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,862
this vote is about setting up
the final stages of this game.

534
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:39,241
So how do we
tell Gabler how this works?

535
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:41,724
- I think we just tell Gabler
how we're gonna do it.
- Yeah.

536
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:42,862
Just say, like...

537
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:46,517
<i>I've always liked Gabler.</i>

538
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,172
<i>He's been a pretty straight
shooter this whole time,</i>

539
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:50,793
<i>and he's a free agent
that will be loyal.</i>

540
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:52,965
And that's somebody
I want to pick up.

541
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:56,103
Deal.

542
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:58,000
- 100%. 100%, right here.
- Yeah?

543
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,137
<i>GABLER: Deal.</i>

544
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:04,482
<i>Cody approached me and said,
"I think we can work together."</i>

545
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:07,241

I'm thinking the same thing.

Ryan and Cass' is going. Um...
- Okay.

554
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:27,724

610
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:54,517
Karla doesn't
want Owen in the game,

611
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,793

612
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:57,206
<i>And as much as I love James,</i>

613
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,655
it just makes the most sense
to get rid of him.

614
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,482

How bad would it be

628
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,689
It's gonna be bad. We're
gonna go against a majority

629
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:30,310
that's gonna be like, "Why the
... did y'all vote James out?"

630

If the vote goes with James,

631

I don't think

That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

633
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,620
<i>Owen is expendable

634

644
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:58,724
And why would I
get rid of one of my numbers?

645
00:27:01,172 --> 00:27:03,793
<i>If we go with Owen,
Owen's a simple vote,</i>

646

<i>in the sense that

647

00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,241
Cody's peed all over that camp.

666
00:28:05,344 --> 00:28:06,862
Like, it's really just...

667
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,827
It was
a pretty crappy afternoon.

668
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:10,827
James, that's a fair response.

669
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:12,103
This game is punishing.

670
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:15,068
Jeff, I feel like
losing in this game,

671
00:28:15,172 --> 00:28:17,103
like not eating in this game

672
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:20,000
and the frustration of
this game can get to everybody.

673
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:22,034
And I feel like
there was frustration

674
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:23,655
back at the beach,
and, you know,

675
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:25,482
that happens with this game.

676
00:28:25,586 --> 00:28:29,137
PROBST:
Sami, are you aware
of what James is alluding to?

677
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,896
- Yeah, I'm aware
of what James is alluding to.
- [laughs]

678
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,482
SAMI:
Uh, in terms of frustrations.

679
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,655
PROBST:
What happened?

680
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:36,827
Um, Owen
went off to the water well,

681
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:39,448
and James followed him,
and then there was a little bit

682
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,862
of back and forth
going on when they came back.

683
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:43,931
I think that
the two of these guys,

684
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:45,793
they just have a lot of
mutual respect for each other...

685
00:28:47,137 --> 00:28:49,413
...but they just
can't get along in the game.

686
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:50,655
We were able
to have civil conversations

687
00:28:50,758 --> 00:28:52,275
throughout the rest of the day.

688
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:54,793
PROBST:
Owen, Sami's answer
sounded like a coach.

689
00:28:54,896 --> 00:28:57,310
- Yeah. [laughs]
- He's got a couple
of high-priced players

690
00:28:57,413 --> 00:29:00,103
that he wants to stay on
the team. He's like, "You know,

691
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,793
- there's just differences.
They work it out."
- [laughs]

692
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:04,689
So is this an argument
or just a discussion?

693
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:07,000
I was definitely upset, disappointed,

694
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:09,931
frustrated after being
left out of the vote last night,

695
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,275
when Jeanine went home.

696
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:13,724
I felt that
James had a big part in that.

697
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:14,931
He told me
to do a certain thing,

698
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:17,275
and that ended up
not being what happened.

699
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:20,206
So today I was just
airing some of my frustrations,

700
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,275
and I just ended up
kind of losing my cool a bit,

701
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:25,482
raising my voice
when I probably shouldn't have.

702
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:26,758
PROBST:
Okay, so wait. Now, hang on.

703
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:28,310
That sounds like there was

704
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:30,655
a little more to it
than just a conversation.

705
00:29:30,758 --> 00:29:32,931
- No, there was yelling.
There was yelling.
- Yeah, there was...

706
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:34,241
I mean, I'm trying
to eat frickin' ripe papaya

707
00:29:34,344 --> 00:29:36,586
without a machete,
and I'm chewing into it.

708
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:38,241
Then all of a sudden,
I hear these two yelling,

709
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,896
- coming back
from the water well.
- Yeah.

710
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,482
And James
throwing up his hands saying,

711
00:29:41,586 --> 00:29:43,551
-"There's nothing I can do."
And Owen...
- [laughs]

712
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:45,827
NOELLE:
Owen basically kind of
giving him a little swear,

713
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:48,482
- like, "... off."
- Here's what happened, Jeff.

714
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,724
So, we're talking at the well.
I'm getting frustrated at James,

715
00:29:50,827 --> 00:29:52,793
given
the Jeanine Tribal Council.

716
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:55,655
I'm saying, "What else
can I do to prove to you

717
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:57,103
"that I'm open for business?

718
00:29:57,206 --> 00:30:00,103
You told me to vote for Ryan.
I voted for Ryan."

719
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:02,551
I asked you to vote for Ryan,
and that was a form of trust.

720
00:30:02,655 --> 00:30:05,000
And you did that,
and you-you had my trust.

721
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,862
You're frustrated
because you feel like

722
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:08,931
you're in a bad spot
in this game,

723
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,620
and you were frustrated
and you let it out.

724
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:13,103
And I'm sorry you did that, but
don't act like it was my fault.

725
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:15,137
You were following me back
after I tried to end

726
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:16,896
- the conversation, and you
were trying to talk to me
- I was walking...

727
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,137
- All right, we're done.
- after I said,
"We're done talking."

728
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:20,689
Too much testosterone.
I'm done with it.

729
00:30:20,793 --> 00:30:23,379
PROBST:
So I think
I understand what happened.

730
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:26,758
Tell me if I got this right.
Owen, you're frustrated because

731
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:30,379
James said vote Ryan, and you
did, but that wasn't the vote.

732
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:32,689
And James is saying,
"You want to earn my trust.

733
00:30:32,793 --> 00:30:34,206
"You did. You voted Ryan.

734
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,034
It wasn't the vote,
but you were trustworthy to me."

735
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:38,034
- Is that right, James?
- JAMES: Correct.

736
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,758
And I feel like trust

737
00:30:39,862 --> 00:30:41,655
is the key currency
in this social contract,

738
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,862
as you said,
that's <i>Survivor</i> right now.

739
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:46,000
Last Tribal's vote showed trust.

740
00:30:46,103 --> 00:30:47,344
And I feel like
we'll leave this Tribal

741
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:49,620
with more trust moving forward.

742
00:30:50,655 --> 00:30:53,034
PROBST:
Okay, so you're at Vesi beach.

743
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:55,482
You've only got five people.

744
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:58,758
You don't know what's happening
on the other beach,

745
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:00,724
but now you
have to get down to the vote.

746
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:03,275
So, Karla, what did you
feel was happening?

747
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:05,965
KARLA:
It's-it's hard in this game,
even for myself.

748
00:31:06,068 --> 00:31:07,862
Like, I-I have
an immunity right now,

749
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:09,310
but I don't know if what people

750
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,689
are telling me
is the truth or is a lie.

751
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:13,689
I've learned today
that you really have

752
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:16,689
to trust in yourself first,
and go with that feeling,

753
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,758
and hopefully
you continue to move forward.

754
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:23,517
James, how much talk was there--
or maybe none at all--

755
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,344
about how one advantage tonight
with only five people

756
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:28,551
could flip everything?

757
00:31:28,655 --> 00:31:30,965
I think,
on the talk about advantages,

758
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:33,793
that one advantage can really
make a situation very simple

759
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:36,827
and shore up trust
and help everybody move forward.

760
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:38,344
PROBST:
That's interesting, Noelle.

761
00:31:38,448 --> 00:31:41,000
That's a way of looking at it
as a positive thing.

762
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:44,689
The other side of an advantage
is, "Oh, if somebody has one,

763
00:31:44,793 --> 00:31:46,068
they could disrupt my plan,"

764
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:48,068
which would be a negative thing.

765
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:51,275
It is really difficult to
find something of an advantage

766
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:52,655
or an idol and not tell anybody.

767
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:54,896
You have to kind of
use them in your favor,

768
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,172
and you have to be like,
"Listen,

769
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:58,103
"I'm putting this in
with our alliance.

770
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:00,413
"I'm using this with us.
I hope I can gain your trust.

771
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:03,000
Like, this isn't just for me.
This is for us."

772
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:05,448
That's what the basis
is for me moving forward

773
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:08,413
to make alliances stronger
the best that I can.

774
00:32:12,655 --> 00:32:13,896
All right, it is...

775
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,206
Time to vote, right?

776
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,103
You have an advantage?

777
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:20,655
NOELLE:
I have an advantage, Jeff.

778
00:32:20,758 --> 00:32:21,965
PROBST:
All right, read the advantage.

779
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:23,586
NOELLE:
All right.

780
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:25,896
"Congratulations. You made
a risky decision and it worked.

781
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,172
"This advantage
allows you to steal a vote

782
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:29,724
"from another player
at Tribal Council.

783
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:31,724
"The player whose vote
you steal will not vote.

784
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,724
Instead,
you will cast a second vote."

785
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,379
PROBST:
All right.
So, you have the opportunity

786
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:38,103
to take somebody's vote
and make it yours.

787
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,551
Whose vote
are you going to steal?

788
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:41,965
I'm stealing Owen's.

789
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:45,172
PROBST:
All right. Owen, you're nodding.

790
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:47,206
Well, I was on the journey
with Noelle and James,

791
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,172
ironically enough,
back on day four.

792
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:52,137
She felt she was
on the bottom at Vesi,

793
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:54,620
so we both extended
the olive branch and let her

794
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,620
take the advantage that day,
and, uh...

795
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,586
We'll see what happens.

796
00:32:58,689 --> 00:33:01,172
All right, so you are
stealing Owen's vote.

797
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:02,655
Owen, you will not vote.

798
00:33:02,758 --> 00:33:04,551
Noelle, when you go up,
you will vote twice.

799
00:33:04,655 --> 00:33:05,827

All right, let's start
with the obvious.

839
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,517
Big part of the advantage
is you get to come second

840

JESSE:
I'm a little bit shocked.

845
00:36:08,275 --> 00:36:10,689
James seemed to have a lot
going for him in the game,

846
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,034
and I know he had an advantage--
Knowledge Is Power--

847
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:17,068
and there were some advantages
at play in the last Tribal,

848
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:19,413
so I thought
he might be able to, like,

849
00:36:19,517 --> 00:36:22,068
make a move and didn't
expect to see him over there.

that was at the last Tribal,
the Tribal before us.

I really want

who's making moves,
who's shaking things up,

858
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,137

were some alliances

859
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,034
that James was a part of

860
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:47,310

a little bit without him there.

861
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,551
All right,
so let's get into this five.

862
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:50,931

CASSIDY:
For me, it was glorious.

865
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:56,172
I've been dreaming
about peanut butter and jelly

866
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:57,862
for, like, 12 or 13 days,

867
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,620
but, you know, the game
doesn't stop for anybody,

868
00:37:00,724 --> 00:37:04,000
so you realize, "Bam, I'm right
back in the belly of the beast."

869
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:07,793
You know? And-and here we are
back in a small tribe dynamic.

870
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:09,586
And the monster tonight
is also hungry.

871
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:11,793
It wants two heads
for the price of one.

872
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,655
It wants everybody
front and center,

873
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:17,310
so it can pick and choose
who it wants to devour tonight.

874
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:19,655
You know? Except for Cody, who's
protected by the golden monkey.

PROBST:
So, Ryan, Cassidy
said it really well.

879
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:29,758
The fact that
there's only five people

880
00:37:29,862 --> 00:37:34,034
means there has to be some
level of concern for everyone.

881
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:36,275
RYAN:
I would have to definitely
agree with that, Jeff.

882
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,448
And now when we hear
our name on that vote,

883
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,620
- it has a lot more ring to it.
- Oh, yeah.

884
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,206
It's a lot more dangerous,

885
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,310
'cause three Ryans
can mean I'm out.

886
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:46,758
So it's-it's a lot scarier.

887
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:48,448
I'm not ready for you
to come down here and say,

888
00:37:48,551 --> 00:37:49,827
"Okay, I'm gonna
read the votes."

889
00:37:49,931 --> 00:37:53,413
Cassidy, what's that like
when you see somebody

890
00:37:53,517 --> 00:37:55,655
that you just talked to,
and then they walk down

891
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:57,034
the beach with somebody else?

892
00:37:57,137 --> 00:37:59,586
What are you thinking?
What are the fears?

893
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:01,551
At this point, you're kind of
starting to get used to it

894
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,586
and knowing that
it's an inevitable evil,

895
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:05,379
but it is a little
nerve-wracking,

896
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,689
because they could be
talking to you,

897
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:09,206
and then going and laughing
about you to another person,

898
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,206
and be like, "Ha, ha,
they believe me about this."

899
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,793
So you just never know
what kind of conversations

900
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:14,172
people are having.
It's like,

901
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:16,068
you almost wish
you had a can that you could,

902
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:17,758
like, somehow I don't know,
string over there...

903
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,413
and listen
to their conversation.

904
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:23,172
I don't know. Maybe you could
get crafty, but it is tough.

905
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:24,689
It's nerve-wracking, always.

906
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:26,896
PROBST:
So, Cody, you're
in that great spot

907
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,379
where you have
no concern tonight

908
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:32,620
but you still
have a long-term plan,

909
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:34,724
so you still want
to influence the vote.

910
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,758
What's the perspective,
given this is the first time

911
00:38:36,862 --> 00:38:38,379
you've had the necklace?

912
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,965
Oh, yeah. The reality of it is
is I'm the man of the hour,

913
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,344
and everybody
wants to talk to me,

914
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:44,137
and everybody
wants to tell me their story.

915
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,965
And I'm kind of just going,
"Whew.

916
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:49,482
This is a heavy position,"
because to your point,

917
00:38:49,586 --> 00:38:51,586
I've got
to look votes down the road

918
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:53,620
knowing that my vote--

919
00:38:53,724 --> 00:38:55,758
in literally a 25% chance
of each one of these--

920
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:59,241
is going to be heavy
as to who goes home tonight.

921
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:02,068
And, um, I wouldn't give
this necklace up for anything,

922
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:04,862
but it is certainly a different
way to view the game, um,

923
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:06,344
when you do have this on.

924
00:39:06,448 --> 00:39:08,586
Ryan, is it clear that,
at least today,

925
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:11,068
that Cody
was central in everything

926
00:39:11,172 --> 00:39:14,689
because he has a necklace, and
therefore he knows he's safe?

927
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:17,517
I noticed the conversation
with Cody took a bit longer

928
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,000
than the conversations
people had with me.

929
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:22,103
Of course, when you're
not being talked to as much,

930
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,448
you kind of worry a little bit,

931
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:25,965
but you do get your word in
with each person.

932
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:28,241
I know, me, personally,
I have 30 pounds

933
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:30,206
of giant clamshells in my bag,

934
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,482
so if I get voted out, I
get to take those home with me.

935
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:34,586
So, you know,
I've been lugging that around,

936
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:37,206

it can blow up the whole plan.

is going to have impacts
