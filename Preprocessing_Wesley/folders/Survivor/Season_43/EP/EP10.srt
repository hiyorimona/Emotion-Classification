I would have quit.

the last time we had

<i>Any decision I make,
I've made with her.</i>

00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:13,103
And so, like, now I'm out here,

all these decisions by myself,

316

to find my footing,

cheer me on and a...

Really?

338
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,793
JESSE:
"Dear Daddy, I miss you
and I love you.

339

time. Get that money, baby."

341
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,896
-"Get that money, baby."
- OWEN: "Get that money, baby."

342
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,620
NOELLE:
That's amazing.

343
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,655
- Glad I got to share this
with you guys.
- SAMI: Me too.

344
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:18,827
- OWEN: Me too.
- I couldn't have picked
a better group of people.

345
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:20,137
- Yeah.
- OWEN: Yeah.

346
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:21,310
SAMI: I'm gonna tell you guys
right now.

347
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:23,000
I've been thinking
about the game

348
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:24,586
and everything like that.

349
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,172
I'm not breaking off.

350
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:29,241
- NOELLE: Yeah.
- I'm at the point where

351
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:32,448
I'm going next for Cassidy.
I want to get out Cassidy next.

352
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:34,482
- OWEN: Okay.
- Because I'm not flopping back.

353
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:37,172
<i>NOELLE:
I knew moving forward
that Sami is a flipper.</i>

354
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:38,586
<i>You know, he has been</i>

355
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,586
playing the middleman
and going back and forth.

356
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,689
<i>So taking him, I feel like
was beneficial for my game</i>

357
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:47,241
<i>because I could keep him
comfortable so he doesn't keep</i>

358
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:48,793
<i>scrambling, and maybe this will</i>

359
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:50,965
reassure him, "Oh, maybe
I do want to work with Noelle."

360
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:54,206
We can pitch
a three-three vote split

361
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,482
- on Cass and Karla.
- Yeah.

362
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:59,103
<i>NOELLE:
Owen had the idea
of splitting votes</i>

363
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:02,620
<i>between Cass and Karla
just in case Karla has an idol.</i>

364
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:04,000
<i>I want
to start getting the biggest</i>

365
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:05,517
<i>strategic threats
out of this game.</i>

366
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,551
So I'm just hoping
we can get one of those two,

367
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:09,689
and we will be golden.

368
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,896
Yeah, I feel like me, you,

369
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,931
- you, Cody, Gabler.
- NOELLE: Gabler.

370
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:16,758
That's a good five.
That's a good five.

371
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:20,379
I'm just terrified the girls
are already saying my name.

372
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:29,517
Oh, I want some damn pizza.

373
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,931
- I wanted to win that so bad.
- I know.

374
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,379
Like, that'd be
so much more fun.

375
00:16:33,482 --> 00:16:35,586
<i>Those people at the reward--</i>

376
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:37,034
they're gonna
go get a nice rest,

377
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:38,241
they're gonna get a bunch
of food, and they're gonna

378
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:39,448
have a much more
memorable time than us.

379
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:40,896
We're gonna
be out here miserable

380
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,275
<i>and tired
and really not talk that much.</i>

381
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:43,620
<i>I don't know about you, but</i>

382
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:44,896
when I go out for some cocktails

383
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,206
and some food,
I'm pretty chatty.

384
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,620
<i>Wars, negotiations, sales</i>

385
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:51,206
are all done
over breaking bread.

386
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,482
I haven't had much time
with the three of you

387
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:55,000
so it's kind of fun
to get to the opportunity

388
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:56,413
- to know each other, as well.
- GABLER: That's right.

389
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,758
- CASSIDY: Yeah.
- CODY: So, quick strategy talk.

390
00:16:58,862 --> 00:17:01,413
Are you-are you
still skeptical of Sami?

391
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:02,758
Yeah, he's-he's
all over the place.

392
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:04,310
- GABLER: I know.
- CASSIDY: For me, personally,

393
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:06,965
I haven't built any trust
with Noelle or Owen.

394
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,517
I feel like
Owen is her new Dwight.

395
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,827
- KARLA: Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

396
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:14,827
CASSIDY:
Yeah.

397
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:16,896
<i>I know it seems like
it was a total loss</i>

398
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,689
<i>for the people who</i>

399
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:21,862
didn't get the reward, but
to be honest, I'm a big believer

400
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:25,620
in a lot of the time when things
don't seem to go your way,

401
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:27,000
like, there is a silver lining

402
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:28,551
<i>that you can find.</i>

403
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:30,413
Oh, man,
this game's getting crazy.

404
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,172
It's gonna get crazier.

405
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:33,655
<i>CASSIDY:
And so I think this is
the perfect time for me</i>

406
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,241
<i>to find out
where Cody head's at</i>

407
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:37,241
<i>because I do want
to have the numbers on my side</i>

408
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:38,965
because I think that would be
really beneficial for my game.

409
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:42,241
I feel like it's time to start
actually, like, looking at

410
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,206
- getting out the big threats
in this game.
- Yeah.

411
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,448
Like, for example,
I think Noelle's a big threat.

412
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:48,068
I think she...

413
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:49,517
And she's gaining momentum
the longer she's here.

414
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,206
I feel like she's gonna
cook up some more stuff.

415
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,517
- Yeah.
- She's already made
a big move. Like, do we want

416
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,206
to even give her a chance
to make another big move

417
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,827
- and then, like,
build her résumé?
- No. Yeah.

418
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:57,758
<i>CASSIDY: It absolutely
is getting harder and harder</i>

419
00:17:57,862 --> 00:17:59,482
<i>to keep everyone in this group
on the same page.</i>

420
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:01,275
There's so much shifting
in the game right now.

421
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:02,862
These rewards are big,

422
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,137
<i>and that bonds people,
that bring them together.</i>

423
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:06,793
<i>So for me,
I'm just trying to make sure</i>

424
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:09,206
<i>that I can keep my allies
strong, keep us intact,</i>

425
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,758
but I never really fully know

426
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:12,344
where Gabler's at,
to be honest with you.

427
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:15,275
<i>And having him as a vote
is gonna be critical for me.</i>

428
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:17,655
Who do you see yourself, like,
moving forward with on the game?

429
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:19,241
GABLER:
Well, yeah, we'll have to see

430
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:20,931
- who's gonna win tomorrow.
- Yeah.

431
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,241
- You know, if we could...
- How do you feel about,

432
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:23,586
like, Noelle and stuff?

433
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:25,172
I like her a lot, personally.

434
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,689
Obviously, she's...
I mean, she's like a hero

435
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:28,310
inside the game for me.

436
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:29,655
I've thought of that
from the beginning.

437
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:31,655
I've said that multiple times.

438
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:33,758
She's a big threat. I don't want
to go to the end next to her.

439
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,172
- And then we'll see who wins.
- CASSIDY: Yeah.

440
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:36,655
And then we can...
We'll have to make a decision.

441
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:38,137
- KARLA: Then we can talk.
- Cause then we're gonna have

442
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,379
- to make a decision.
- CASSIDY: But I would like...

443
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:40,758
- I would like to vote with you.
- Yes.

444
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:41,965
- Let's do that.
- If you're voting tomorrow.

445
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:43,275
- Okay.
- I would like to do that, too.

446
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:44,896
<i>I positioned myself

447

Both sides are wanting me
to vote with them,

and neither side is talking
about voting for me.

449

A long way to go.

504
00:21:33,862 --> 00:21:35,655
Ain't so easy.

505
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:43,344
Son of a gun.

506
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:02,551
15 minutes into this challenge.

507
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,000
[sighs]

508
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:07,413
It is now Cassidy and Owen
side by side,

509
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:09,000
Karla down at the end.

510
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:10,551
All three about the same height.

511
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:13,482
Everybody else starting over.

512
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:15,379
Owen loses everything.

513
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:17,137
Cassidy continues
to make good work of this.

514
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:18,620
She has found a momentum

515
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:22,206
and great balance
steadying that board.

516
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,310
Cassidy getting closer.

517
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,793
And Cassidy loses half of it.

518
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:30,862
That opens the door for Karla.

519
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:33,344
And Karla drops.
She's back to zero.

520
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:35,827
Now we've got everybody
starting over again, basically,

521
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:37,620
and this is wide open.

522
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:40,000
CODY [sighing]:
Aah. There.

523
00:22:40,103 --> 00:22:41,241
PROBST:
Let it out. Exhale.

524
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:42,689
Get some new energy.

525
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:47,862
You got to keep your eyes
on the prize.

526
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:51,965
Prize is the necklace. The way
you get there-- slow and steady.

527
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:55,620
- Damn!
- No!

528
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:58,206
[groans]

529
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,241
You can't get frustrated.
You just have to start again

530
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:03,931
and keep building.

531
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,827
You start over
in this game all the time.

532
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:09,034
Damn!

533
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,034
PROBST:
It's the theme of <i>Survivor.</i>

534
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:13,482
Keep digging.

535
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:17,448
This is not easy,
but somebody will win.

536
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:19,103
Awesome.

537
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:24,172
28 minutes into this challenge.

538
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:27,758
Right now, just based on height,

539
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:29,586
it is Cassidy in the lead,

540
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:31,724
then Karla,

541
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,379
then Sami,

542
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:37,551
then Owen and Noelle.

543
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:40,413
Owen drops.

544
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:43,103
Cassidy getting close
to the top,

545
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:44,965
but she's been there before.

546
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:47,103
What has she learned
from past attempts

547
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:50,068
about building a structure
that's really stable?

548
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:53,655
Is that enough?

549
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:56,137
That is not gonna do it.

550
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:58,482
You're about an inch short.

551
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:02,551
Sami with another piece.

552
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:07,551
Karla down on the end,
inching near that finish line.

553
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:11,620
Karla and Cassidy almost
at the exact same point.

554
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:15,689
Cassidy has a really
interesting strategy.

555
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:19,448
She thought through this,
learned a lot.

556
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:22,517
She's stacking now so she can
just put one piece vertically

557
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,137
and see if that'll do it.

558
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:28,793
The issue is, can she do this
without faltering?

559
00:24:29,758 --> 00:24:31,931
Karla getting closer.

560
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:34,310
She's one level away.

561
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:37,448
Sami's in it,
inching toward that finish mark.

562
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:42,034
Cassidy has a bit of a lead,
but you can't race.

563
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:44,448
You still have to be composed.

564
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:46,517
Noelle not messing around.

565
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,689
Karla close
to breaking that plane.

566
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:55,172
- [gasps]
- And loses everything!

567
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:57,827
One tile,
literally one tile away.

568
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,620
And it is now Cassidy,

569
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:03,448
Noelle and Sami's to win.

570
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:06,758
Sami trying to catch Cassidy,
but he's got to hope she drops.

571
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:12,068
Because Cassidy could win this
if she can get one

572
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:14,586
vertically from here.

573
00:25:23,517 --> 00:25:25,965
That's it! Cassidy wins

574
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,620
- individual immunity.
- NOELLE: Wow.

575
00:25:28,724 --> 00:25:30,965
PROBST:
Safe tonight.

576
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:35,551
Emotion starts to pour out
after 19 days.

577
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:38,689
Another new winner
of the necklace.

578
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:41,310
- What an effort
in that challenge.
- JESSE: Good job.

579
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:42,586
Great job.

580
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:45,172
Cassidy, come on over.

581
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:47,827
- Congrat...
- Oh, my gosh.

582
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:49,413
[laughter]

583
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:50,827
I'm shaking so hard.

584
00:25:50,931 --> 00:25:53,379
All right, Cassidy,
you are safe in this game.

585
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:56,344
You are gonna
make it to the final seven.

586
00:25:56,448 --> 00:25:59,896
That will not be the case
for all of the rest of you.

587
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,068
After 19 very tough days
out here,

588
00:26:01,172 --> 00:26:03,344
somebody's dream
will end tonight.

589
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:05,000
Eleventh person voted out,
fourth member

590
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:06,517
of our jury.
It will not be you.

591
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,344
Congrats. Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

592
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:10,724
- See you tonight at Tribal.
- Thank you.
- SAMI: Good job, Cass.

593
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:12,689
<i>CASSIDY:
To me, today was just proving</i>

594
00:26:12,793 --> 00:26:14,000
<i>to myself that I am capable</i>

595
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:15,344
of accomplishing
all of my dreams

596
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,068
and my goals in this game.

597
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:19,586
<i>And now, the last thing that
I want to accomplish is winning.</i>

598
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:21,896
<i>And I really am starting
to see that I can do it,</i>

599
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,931
<i>and that's such
a fulfilling feeling for me.</i>

600
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,793
CASSIDY: Oh!

601
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,068
Thank you.

602
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:47,931
- Good job.
- It feels so good.

603
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:49,931
I, like, dreamt about this
so many times.

604
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:52,827
<i>NOELLE: Cassidy won
the challenge today, and</i>

605
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:54,172
<i>it puts a little bit of a hiccup</i>

606
00:26:54,275 --> 00:26:55,758
<i>in our original plan because</i>

607
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:57,931
we were gonna split the
numbers between her and Karla

608
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,448
<i>just in case
Karla plays an idol.</i>

609
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,344
<i>But now I need
to come up with a new backup</i>

610
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:04,655
<i>before Karla
can get something going.</i>

611
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:09,034
- NOELLE: Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

612
00:27:09,137 --> 00:27:10,344
What?

613
00:27:10,448 --> 00:27:12,413
They're looking at me.

614
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:26,862
<i>NOELLE:
Sami-- you know,
I can't trust the guy,</i>

615
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:28,413
<i>especially what happened
with last Tribal Council</i>

616
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:30,034
with everything with James,
him telling Karla

617
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:31,931
ten minutes
before everything that happened.

618
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:34,689
<i>But I gained a ton
of trust with Owen.</i>

619
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:38,827
<i>I have a great relationship and
alliance with Jesse and Cody,</i>

620
00:27:38,931 --> 00:27:40,827
<i>and Gabler's
a straight-up guy, so,</i>

621
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:44,655
<i>I'm 95% confident
we can still vote out Karla.</i>

622
00:27:57,172 --> 00:28:00,482
- But Cass isn't gonna
trust me or you again.
- CODY: Yup.

623
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:01,827
- And then she'll have Cass.
- Yup.

624
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,620
Now we're...

625
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:07,034
<i>Yesterday, I had, like,
a very emotional human moment</i>

626
00:28:07,137 --> 00:28:08,586
<i>reading my letters
from home, and,</i>

627
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,827
<i>like, Noelle is the one
that gave me that moment.</i>

628
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:12,241
<i>So it makes it hard to think</i>

629
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:14,137
<i>about potentially
voting her out.</i>

630
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:18,137
<i>But reading those letters, now
I'm using that to motivate me</i>

631
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:21,482
<i>to make the best decisions
for me and my family back home.</i>

632
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:23,206
<i>So,</i>

633
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,448
whatever I might want to do
emotionally out here, you know,

634
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:30,000
the emotional commitment I have
back home trumps all of that.

635
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:31,448
CODY:
She's good, dude.

636
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:33,172
JESSE:
Every time we box her in,

637
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:34,862
- she finds a way out.
- Yup, she finds a way out.

638
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,344
- She's picking up speed
for sure.
- We can't have it.

639
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:40,137
<i>JESSE:
I see Noelle as one
of the best players out here.</i>

640
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:41,931
Every time
I take out her number one,

641
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,586
she comes back
with another number one,

642
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,034
<i>and she comes back stronger.</i>

643
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:47,551
<i>And we see it
in the challenges, right?</i>

644
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:49,068
<i>Like, she comes back from,
like, you know,</i>

645
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:52,241
being at the very end and
winning. Like, so she's, like,

646
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:53,586
<i>always gonna find a way</i>

647
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:55,068
<i>to fight through
and make things happen.</i>

648
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:56,724
- She'll turn on us.
- Oh, yeah.

649
00:28:56,827 --> 00:28:58,275
Very quickly.
I wouldn't be surprised

650
00:28:58,379 --> 00:29:00,172
if she takes out Karla
and then she takes out us.

651
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:02,275
You're probably right.

652
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:03,517
Yeah, I mean,
she's got to go tonight.

653
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,689
- Yup.
- Got to be.

654
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:06,206
<i>JESSE:
But the thing is,</i>

655
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,793
<i>when you blindside somebody,</i>

656
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:10,517
<i>[laughing]: you have to know
what you're doing here.</i>

657
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,793
<i>Otherwise, it might come back
and blow up on you.</i>

658
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:16,931
<i>So checklist number one--
you have to have a cover story.</i>

659
00:29:17,034 --> 00:29:18,620
<i>Noelle's on edge</i>

660
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,758
right now. She's a little
bit nervous, I can tell.

661
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:24,068
<i>And because she's on edge
right now, if you don't give her</i>

662
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:26,620
a cover story
for every conversation you have,

663
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,275
<i>when she goes and sits on a log</i>

664
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:30,000
<i>and starts
thinking things through,</i>

665
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,862
she's gonna start wondering why
you had it and what you said.

666
00:29:34,827 --> 00:29:37,137
It was good.

667
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:38,793
- Oh, you had it? Perfect.
- Yeah.

668
00:29:38,896 --> 00:29:40,379
Now we're straight.

669
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:42,586
<i>No way</i>

670
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:44,448
<i>- that she sees it coming.
- JESSE: Yeah.</i>

671
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:45,862
- It'll be so good.
- Yeah.

672
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:47,172
So I want you to talk
to Sami and see

673
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:48,517
if he's 100% on board,

674
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,793
because I feel like
he would tell you.

675
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:51,379
Okay.

676
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:52,896
<i>I was already planning
to talk to Sami</i>

677
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,655
<i>because if I'm gonna
take out Noelle,</i>

678
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:56,862
<i>I need for her
to split the votes,</i>

679
00:29:56,965 --> 00:29:59,413
<i>and I want her
to split the votes on Sami.</i>

680
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:01,482
He's not seen as trustworthy
by either side,

681
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,689
<i>so I'm just gonna
help that a little bit.</i>

682
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,827
- I don't want Karla
to go just yet.
- Yeah.

683
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:11,448
But I'm thinking, like...

684
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:17,931
- Yeah.
- But I don't think we could go

685
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:19,241
to the end of this game
with Noelle.

686
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:20,586
- Do you think that?
- I don't...

687
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:21,931
I don't think we could.

688
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:23,517
<i>JESSE:
So, checklist number two.</i>

689
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,413
<i>You always have to have
the fall guy. [laughs]</i>

690
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:36,758
OWEN: Going back and forth?

691
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:38,206
Hmm.

692
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:43,344
So I think that we need
to split the votes.

693
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:46,482
NOELLE: Karla.

694
00:30:47,724 --> 00:30:49,551
- JESSE: Sami.
- NOELLE: Sami. Okay.

695
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:55,655
JESSE:
They're trying to get it

696
00:30:55,758 --> 00:30:59,793
so that the votes are split,
three-three

697
00:30:59,896 --> 00:31:03,103
on Sami and you.

698
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:05,793
- Oh.
- Because they're scared

699
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:08,482
- that you have an idol.
- Yeah. Okay.

700
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:11,310
So then how many votes
do we have for Noelle?

701
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:14,827
Me, you, Cody and Cass.

702
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,034
I don't...

703
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:22,551
You think that's she's gonna
flip her vote?

704
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:24,517
Yeah. If we're talking
the way we're talking right now,

705
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,827
she's gonna assume
that you all are voting with me.

706
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:29,344
So that's gonna be a four-four.

707
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:31,586
Unless we can get Gabler.

708
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,310
<i>Checklist number three.</i>

709
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:36,896
<i>You always have
to have a backup plan.</i>

710
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,241
Are you okay with that?

711
00:31:55,344 --> 00:31:57,241
Yeah, I think so.

712
00:31:57,344 --> 00:31:59,103
- Let me just think
about this for a second.
- Yeah, for sure.

713
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:01,655
<i>GABLER:
'Cause, you know, I've got
relationships with Owen and Sami</i>

714

<i>that are gonna
be torched by this,</i>

715
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:06,793
and we got to think
about the jury at some point.

716
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:08,551
<i>JESSE:
Gabler is smart, right?</i>

717
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:10,931
<i>Like, he's thinking things
through, and so, in this game,</i>

718
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,034
you can't just tell them
to vote a certain way.

719
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:14,448
<i>You have to
make it make sense, right?</i>

720
00:32:14,551 --> 00:32:16,448
<i>And so I was trying
to get Gabler</i>

721
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:18,206
<i>to sort of envision
his position in the game</i>

722
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,655
after this vote.

723
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:21,551
I want him to envision,
like, himself

724
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:23,068
<i>in the power position.</i>

725
00:32:23,172 --> 00:32:25,482
Me and Cody-- we took out

726
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:28,517
her friend Justine, and then
she got a friend-- Dwight.

727
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,137
Then we took out Dwight,
and then,

728
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:31,689
- she got a friend-- Owen.
- Got a friend-- Owen.

729
00:32:31,793 --> 00:32:33,965
And then she did that huge move
in front of the jury.

730
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:35,689
- Yes. Correct.
- So every time we try

731
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:38,206
and weaken her position,
she comes back.

732
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,586
JESSE: And, I mean, she's
a warrior. That's what she is.

733
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:42,379
I know she's got to go
before we get too far.

734
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:43,551
Then we could be back
in the middle

735
00:32:43,655 --> 00:32:44,896
to choose again tomorrow night

736
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,931
- who we want to go...
- So me, you and Cody

737
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:48,310
would be in
a very powerful position.

738
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:49,896

of sheer determination

773
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:52,241
Noelle, did you have a moment
where you could reflect

774
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:54,931
on how that
might inspire somebody

775
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:57,206

that balance beam, struggling,

781

I'm able to win the challenge.

I mean, that's definitely
a huge reason why I'm out here,

you know, out here
since day one together,

793
00:35:40,586 --> 00:35:43,344

talk so much about my family,

so much about my kids,

everyone has their own vision
of how tonight's gonna pan out,

815
00:36:27,862 --> 00:36:30,000

that the plan that

been proven to me and proven

that's not always the case,

829
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:04,206
it's a little bit like
you're negotiating to buy a car,

830
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,275
but you never get to sign
the contract which locks it in.

831
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:08,724
It's always just like,
"No, we're good,

832
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,310
we're good. You don't need
to sign anything."

833

JESSE:
Yeah, I mean, trust
is the currency out here,

834
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:14,068
and you just have
to sort of trust the people

835
00:37:14,172 --> 00:37:16,068
who have the biggest bills,
I guess, right?

836
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:18,758
And you can't really spend
too much time checking the bills

837
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,758
like you would in,
like, retail or something.

838
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:22,379
Like, you could hold it
under the black light,

839
00:37:22,482 --> 00:37:24,034
you could write... you know?

840
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:26,068
Because you're implying
you don't trust them?

841
00:37:26,172 --> 00:37:28,000
- Yeah.
- PROBST: Wow.

842
00:37:28,103 --> 00:37:32,241
So, Cody, there must be
constant lack of certainty

843
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:36,034
that the last conversation
you had

844
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:38,758
is the last one
you needed to have.

845
00:37:38,862 --> 00:37:40,689
CODY:
Absolutely. I mean,

846
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:44,034
the strategy talk changes
throughout the day,

847
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,655
person by person, hour by hour,
and the conversation

848
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:51,275
that, say, I have,
you know, at hour 12

849
00:37:51,379 --> 00:37:55,482
is maybe not the same one
that I have at hour 14.

850
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:57,586
And if it is the same,
is the body language the same,

851
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:59,275
are the eyes starting to wander?

852
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:00,758
Are the shoulders
starting to change?

853
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,413
To see if they're
getting uncomfortable

854
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:04,068
in what they're telling you.

855
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:05,655
Because as that day progresses,

856
00:38:05,758 --> 00:38:07,310
they're talking
to other people as well

857
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,206
and they're hearing all these
stories and they're trying

858
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,000
to decipher which ones
they want to agree with

859
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:12,482
and they want
to move forward with.

860
00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:13,793
SAMI:
And that's what makes
this game so hard

861
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:15,172
is, like, I could be
feeling really good

862
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:17,275
about a conversation,
and you come out of it,

863
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:20,310
but then, if they're talking
to somebody else for too long,

864
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:22,482
and you wish they looked at
you like that. Like, "They don't

865
00:38:22,586 --> 00:38:24,206
look at me like that, they don't
talk to me like that."

866
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,344
But at the end of the day,

867
00:38:26,448 --> 00:38:29,551
something was said to somebody
that wasn't true. It was me,

868
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,827
it was somebody else, but we
don't know who it's going to be

869
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:34,034
- until we go up there and vote.
- PROBST: So, Gabler,

870
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:35,551
really, it's the duck

871
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:38,379
up top... [laughs]
underneath. [trills]

872
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,034
GABLER:
Well, what I think is happening,

873
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:43,551
is most of these killers now
are working with silencers,

874
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,655
- and that's what's going on.
We're...
- PROBST: Who...

875
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,689
- You pointed this way. Who?
- Everybody. Everybody...

876
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,448
Everybody up here.

877
00:38:49,551 --> 00:38:51,793
There's not, like,
a grenade blowing up.

878
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,793
These are very
precision targets.

879
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,896
There's a lot of work
going into them,

880
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,103
and there's gonna be
one fired bullet tonight,

881
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:00,689
and it's probably
gonna hit the mark

882
00:39:00,793 --> 00:39:02,068
that I think it's gonna hit,

883
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:04,103
but, uh,
we're gonna find out.

884
00:39:04,206 --> 00:39:08,517
PROBST:
Karla, that was
a very colorful story saying,

885
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,758
"We're assassins waiting for you

886
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:14,103
to get right where we need you,
and then, boom, you're done."

887
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:16,655
Yeah, and that's the part
that makes people nervous

888
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:18,586
is you can't hear them coming,

889
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,172
you can't hear their steps.
You hope that you get to...

890
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:23,724
maybe you open up one eyelid,
and you're like,

891
00:39:23,827 --> 00:39:25,275
"I'll-I'll take a quick peek,"

892
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:28,103
and hope that you know who
it is, um, before it's too late.

893
00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:30,275
NOELLE:
And also, you know,
you're thinking

894
00:39:30,379 --> 00:39:32,586
in the back of your head,
"Someone in this group, like,

895
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:35,827
there's a very, very great
chance that they have an idol."

896
00:39:35,931 --> 00:39:38,758
That's another reason why we're
playing this type of silent

897
00:39:38,862 --> 00:39:40,724
killer assassins game is 'cause
we don't know what's out there,

898
00:39:40,827 --> 00:39:42,448
we don't know who has it.

899
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:45,689
So, trying to line up
your target, it's scary,

900
00:39:45,793 --> 00:39:47,689
because you could 100% miss.

901
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:50,103
Jesse, last question.

902
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:51,689
If Tribal goes the way
you want it to go,

903
00:39:51,793 --> 00:39:54,103
how will it change the game?

904
00:39:54,206 --> 00:39:58,172
It will lay the foundation
for the rest of my game.

905
00:39:58,275 --> 00:40:00,724
And I'm gonna quote my son,

906
00:40:00,827 --> 00:40:02,586
because he wrote me
a letter, and...

907
00:40:02,689 --> 00:40:05,655
Well, he told me
to "Get that money, baby."

908
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:08,517
- [laughter]
- So it will set me up

909
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,482
to get that money, baby.

910
00:40:10,586 --> 00:40:12,655
Perfect ending.

911
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:14,310
It is time to vote.

912
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:17,172

00:43:24,862 --> 00:43:26,137
I came into this game wanting
