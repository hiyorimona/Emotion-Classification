1
00:00:14,034 --> 00:00:15,344
<i>Tribal went well.</i>

2
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,448
<i>Jesse and I
decided to make a big move</i>

3
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,241
<i>and vote out Dwight.</i>

4
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:21,758
Team Coco jumped on board.
Me, Jesse, Team Coco.

5
00:00:21,862 --> 00:00:23,448
And then, to my surprise,

6
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:24,793
who I would have never thought,

7
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:26,206
<i>Sami jumped on board, as well.</i>

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,793
That went the way
it was supposed to.

9
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:29,724
It's tough to vote
somebody out of my own tribe.

10
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:31,103
- Obviously, but...
- Uh-huh.

11
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:32,896
- It worked out. And it's fun.
- Anyways.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,689
- All right, bro, cool.
- It was an honor sitting by you.

13
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:36,344
- It was a lot of fun.
- I know. Let's do it again.

14
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:37,862
<i>Before Tribal,</i>

15
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,724
it was pretty common knowledge
that James had gotten

16
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:41,275
<i>the Knowledge
Is Power Advantage.</i>

17
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:43,896
<i>And everybody
was in a panic mode,</i>

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,137
<i>moving around
advantages and idols.</i>

19
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:48,448
<i>But when you
hand that thing over,</i>

20
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:49,793
<i>you got to hope and pray</i>

21
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:51,517
<i>that you
made the right decision.</i>

22
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:55,379
At this point, if you never
want to talk to me again,

23
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:58,241
I get it. But I want you
to listen to me, at least,

24
00:00:58,344 --> 00:00:59,551
- Yeah.
- for a little bit,

25
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:01,068
because this
is the second time in a row

26
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:03,034
- you had no idea
what was happening.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:05,206
And you guys have to understand,

28
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,758
I find out
Jesse and Cody are flipping.

29
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:09,862
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:12,137
Dwight's going home, regardless.

31
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:13,965
<i>Tribal ended up being</i>

32
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:15,448
worst-case scenario for me

33
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:18,103
in every possible way.

34
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:20,586
<i>I lost an ally in Dwight.</i>

35
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:23,689
<i>And before Tribal Council,
I had given</i>

36
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,689
Dwight my idol to hold on to.

37
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,862
Okay.

38
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:31,551
It's not going anywhere?

39
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:32,931
Okay.

40
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:34,586
I'll wash it off
before giving it back to you.

41
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:35,896
Oh, thank you.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,206
<i>I was on such a high, and then</i>

43
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,827
everything slipped
through my fingers.

44
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:44,482
<i>I was so shocked.
I blacked out</i>

45
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:46,482
<i>the moment where
he got his torch snuffed.</i>

46
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:47,965
<i>And I'm like,</i>

47
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:52,379
"I'm a freaking idiot
and had my idol

48
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:54,344
<i>go home in Dwight's crotch."</i>

49
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:57,793
I know.

50
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:02,344
I get how hard it will be
to listen to me at this point,

51
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:05,172
but nobody even wanted to, like,

52
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,482
consider working with you while
the idol was still in the game.

53
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,206
<i>This can't be real.
This can't be happening.</i>

54
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,000
<i>I have no numbers, no immunity</i>

55
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:16,103
<i>and no idea of how to even</i>

56
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:18,448
start picking up the pieces.

57
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:21,034
Dwight had Jeanine's idol.

58
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:22,206
- He had Jeanine's idol.
- Yeah, so...

59
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,379
I didn't want it...
We didn't want it here.

60
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:30,413
He literally went home
with Jeanine's idol.

61
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,068
That's freaking amazing.

62
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:34,448
You all know
where Jeanine's idol was?

63
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:35,724
- No, where?
- Where?

64
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:37,724
Dwight's pocket.

65
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:40,034
- No.
<i>- So it turns out</i>

66
00:02:40,137 --> 00:02:42,379
Jeanine's idol got flushed
sort of on accident.

67
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:44,655
<i>It's insane.
Like, the idol's gone.</i>

68
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:46,068
So it was kind of perfect.

69
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:48,103
They were shuffling advantages,

70
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:50,206
because they were scared
of whatever you have.

71
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,517
- Yep.
- Yep.

72
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,448
The last thing I heard,
in the shuffle,

73
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:56,551
was that it went
into Dwight's pocket.

74
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:57,862
- He had it.
- And so...

75
00:02:57,965 --> 00:02:59,620
- I'm telling you, he had it.
- Yeah.

76
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:01,172
<i>Everybody's high-fiving</i>

77
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:05,241
<i>because Dwight went home
with an idol in his pocket. But</i>

78
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,310
that idol is... in my pocket,

79
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:11,275
and nobody knows about it.

80
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,241
<i>Before Tribal Council,</i>

81
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:18,137
<i>Dwight comes up to me,
he's panicked,</i>

82
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,413
<i>and so he drops the idol
in my pocket.</i>

83
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:22,551
<i>This is awesome.
I already have Cody's idol</i>

84
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:25,724
<i>that he gave me and he hasn't
asked for it back yet, so, like,</i>

85
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:28,827
in a way,
I kind of have two idols here.

86
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:31,517
A idol may be back
in circulation now.

87
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,448
But here's the thing, though:
I can take it.

88
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,000
Uh-huh.

89
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,517
<i>Knowledge is power in this game,</i>

90
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,689
and I know there's a Knowledge
Is Power floating around.

91
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:41,310
<i>So I'm keeping the idol
to myself.</i>

92
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:42,931
<i>That way I can make big moves</i>

93
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:45,827
that people aren't necessarily
seeing until it's too late.

94
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,413
Yeah.

95
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,827
Then we can write our names,
like, just wherever.

96
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:00,172
I like that idea.

97
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,379
This is so cute. I'm excited.

98
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:04,172
- Just like this?
- Yeah.

99
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:05,310
- Perfect.
- Okay.

100
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,103
That looks really good.

101
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:10,413
<i>Un poquito.</i>

102
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,758
<i>Un poquito?</i>

103
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:16,068
Yeah.

104
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:19,413
His parents only speak Spanish.

105
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:21,655
- And so, like, I went
and I met them, and, like...
- Oh.

106
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:23,379
- Oh, that's tough.
- So, like,

107
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:24,862
they said, like, "I love you."

108
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,551
And that was, like,
the only words they could say.

109
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:28,758
- And, like, it was just
my first time meeting them.
- Aw.

110
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:30,758
- But, like, I just couldn't say
anything, so it's all weird.
- Oh, that's hard.

111
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:32,620
- That is weird.
- Yeah.

112
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:34,344
I tried to teach myself
a little Korean

113
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,034
in the middle of the pandemic.

114
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:38,275
I was like,
"Maybe I should learn this."

115
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,655
'Cause I'm adopted.

116
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:41,103
I don't know
if y'all had heard that part...

117
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:42,275
- Oh. No.
- Yeah, I have white,

118
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:43,827
I have white parents, so...

119
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:46,344
- Oh.
- I didn't grow up with
a lot of Korean culture.

120
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:49,379
Kind of rejected it a bit,
but coming around.

121
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:50,482
It's nice.

122
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:53,482
<i>So I was adopted
when I was four months old.</i>

123
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:54,896
<i>I was born in Korea.</i>

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,620
Owen Knight is not
a particularly Korean name.

125
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,344
<i>My parents are amazing.</i>

126
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:01,586
<i>I've had a wonderful,
wonderful life,</i>

127
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:04,862
<i>but I was not like most kids.</i>

128
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:07,413
<i>Being Asian
was what made me different</i>

129
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:09,413
<i>and I just wanted to fit in.</i>

130
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,655
I wanted
to be a "regular kid" and just,

131
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:13,103
like, get the same haircut,

132
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:17,655
<i>and it just, i-it was isolating.</i>

133
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:21,034
<i>And now this game
reminds me of my childhood.</i>

134
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:24,689
<i>Being left out of the vote
two Tribal Councils in a row,</i>

135
00:05:24,793 --> 00:05:28,758
it's hard to not blame myself
and wonder what's wrong with me.

136
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,241
Hopefully I'll hear if my name
comes up, but it's scary.

137
00:05:31,344 --> 00:05:33,655
I was not on the bus yesterday,

138
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:35,206
and, like,
I just thought the numbers

139
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,310
- were going
the other direction, so...
- Yeah.

140
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:38,965
It feels like I'm running
around the playground

141
00:05:39,068 --> 00:05:40,379
asking people to play with me

142
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:43,034
<i>and no one wants to.</i>

143
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:45,827
<i>If making final Tribal
is getting into college,</i>

144
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,758
<i>right now, my transcript</i>

145
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:51,896
is sorry.
I have a 1.7 GPA right now.

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,413
My extracurriculars
are in the toilet.

147
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:55,965
I've got no recommendations.

148
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:59,689
<i>Nobody has anything good
to say about me right now.</i>

149
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,758
<i>So I just need
to take a breath and reset</i>

150
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,034
<i>and remind myself
I'm here to have fun</i>

151
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:07,068
<i>and that we are
all on our own personal journey.</i>

152
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:10,103
<i>I have hope that
there's room to maneuver</i>

153
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>and that there are some people
who feel left out,</i>

154
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:14,103
<i>feel on the bottom,</i>

155
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:15,379
<i>and that we can start a little</i>

156
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:17,241
uprising of sorts.

157
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:20,034
It's finally
just us bottom dwellers.

158
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,413
I don't understand
how it flipped so quickly.

159
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:26,724
I guess Jesse and Cody were
threatened by Dwight and that...

160
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:29,275
...they saw the opportunity.

161
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,000
<i>Cody and Jesse flipped,
and I was left in the dark.</i>

162
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:34,827
And that's shame on me,
because people started

163
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,137
playing this game before I did,

164
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:37,517
and that's just
a kick in the ass.

165
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,103
I'm not ready
to go down without a fight.

166
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:43,206
Like, we still have us three.
We have Gabler.

167
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,275
- We need two more.
- We need two more.

168
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,758
<i>Right now, it seems
like us three</i>

169
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:50,137
<i>and Gabler
are on the bottom, but</i>

170
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,965
I don't believe the seven people
that voted last night

171
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,275
are seven strong,
and they're gonna be like,

172
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,034
<i>"This is gonna
be the final seven."</i>

173
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:57,965
<i>I don't believe that.
That never works out.</i>

174
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,413
<i>How are you?</i>

175
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:02,000
<i>I feel pretty good.</i>

176
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:05,275
Have you started feeling
anyone out or anything out yet?

177
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:07,620
Right now, we have seven
with that last vote.

178
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:10,310
That can take us pretty far.

179
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,517
Like, this makes me
extremely happy, is that we...

180
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:16,000
I know.

181
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:20,206
Coming out of Tribal Council,
the seven

182
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,827
<i>that voted out Dwight
were me, James, Cassidy,</i>

183
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:27,758
<i>Karla, Cody, Sami and Ryan.</i>

184
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:30,310
<i>And we all seem to be
on the same page that, like,</i>

185
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:31,931
this could be the seven,
right, that make it,

186
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,482
and then we sort of, like,
all guns blaze

187
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:36,241
<i>and we'll just
turn on each other.</i>

188
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:37,724
<i>That would be awesome
if we could just, like,</i>

189
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:40,137
skip to our Lou to the end of,
you know, the game.

190
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:41,517
- What do we think...
- What's next?

191
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,586
Yeah, what's next?

192
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:44,793
Does anybody have a preference?

193
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:52,620
So, I think Owen.
Owen is kind of a snake.

194
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:54,620
<i>I don't think he really has,
like, a backbone.</i>

195
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,275
<i>He's not gonna ever
put his foot down.</i>

196
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,482
<i>He's always gonna
follow the numbers,</i>

197
00:07:57,586 --> 00:07:59,655
and that's dangerous
in this game.

198
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:02,379
<i>I have strong opinions
about who should go.</i>

199
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,758
<i>I really want Owen out.</i>

200
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,344
He voted for me
at two previous Tribal Councils.

201
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:09,241
He is not my friend
in this game, and

202
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:11,310
<i>when you have an opportunity
to take someone out</i>

203
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:13,137
<i>that you really,
really don't trust,</i>

204
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,000
<i>you take that person out.</i>

205
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:26,793
I had a dream...
This is gonna sound so stupid.

206
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,241
I... My dreams are wild here.
Probst was there.

207
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,310
It was, like,
an eating competition,

208
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,172
but it was, like,
a lot of chicken.

209
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:36,413
It was, like, a lot of chicken.

210
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,931
But then Probst was like,
"I'm hungry."

211
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:40,103
And I was like, "Here,
you could have some of mine."

212
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:42,862
And then he decides
to make ramen.

213
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:45,275
Ramen, and that's his lunch.

214
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,758
And he proceeds to, like,
get in the middle of all of us,

215
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,758
- kind of like crowd-surf.
- What?

216
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,827
And he's like,
"All right, selfie time."

217
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,448
You know, "Picture time."
And I'm like,

218
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:55,827
-"This is weirdest thing ever."
- That is an awesome dream.

219
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:58,206
Yeah, you had a good dream, man.
That's great.

220
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:00,931
<i>I'm really dreaming about food.</i>

221
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:01,896
<i>People are definitely
hungry right now.</i>

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,137
People are starving, um...

223
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,310
<i>We've been talking
about food just constantly.</i>

224
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,793
I want to eat every... something
from every one on the menu.

225
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:11,344
Like an appetizer,
a regular entrée

226
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:13,103
and a dessert,
'cause I never do that.

227
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,344
I'm gonna order the pepperoni
stuffed crust, right?

228
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:16,931
I'm-a get two of those.

229
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,758
And then I'm gonna
pick up really good bur...

230
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,206
a few really good burritos.

231
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,137
And those are gonna
get wrapped with the pizza.

232
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:23,758
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

233
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:25,896
I'm glad you're excited about
it. I don't know if I could

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,137
- do the pizza... the burrito
- I'm not on board

235
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:28,551
- wrapped in pizza.
- with the pizza burrito.

236
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:30,758
<i>You know,
I don't need to eat</i>

237
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,620
to win this game.
I think that is a luxury.

238
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,586
But check this out, boys.

239
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:39,413
<i>I had a muffin top
coming out here,</i>

240
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:41,482
<i>but the wolf pack is hungry.</i>

241
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:43,620
Everybody is
physically depleted.

242
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:45,103
- Ready?
- Yeah.

243
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,103
Ah, daddy-o.

244
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:47,413
<i>Last night's Tribal,</i>

245
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:49,172
I was on the wrong side
of the votes.

246
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:51,413
<i>So today, I'm gonna spearfish,</i>

247
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:53,206
<i>trying to curry favor
with everybody,</i>

248
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,310
<i>but our biggest food provider,</i>

249
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:57,379
bar none, is Ryan.

250
00:09:57,482 --> 00:09:59,103
Uh, he loves to do it.

251
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:02,206
<i>He's just, you know,
he's an absolute physical beast.</i>

252
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,758
<i>I went from,
as a kid with cerebral palsy,</i>

253
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:09,068
<i>being told, "You can't walk.</i>

254
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,655
"You're gonna
to be in a wheelchair,

255
00:10:10,758 --> 00:10:13,068
and your mom's gonna have
to help you most of your life,"

256
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:15,758
<i>to catching fish
in the Fijian waters.</i>

257
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:24,241
<i>If I had given up</i>

258
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:26,586
on trying to walk,
if I had given up

259
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:28,586
<i>on being myself
and really caring about others,</i>

260
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:30,793
<i>I probably wouldn't be
as far as I am in this game</i>

261
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,758
<i>and I probably
wouldn't be on</i> Survivor.

262
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:34,206
<i>And being a provider--</i>

263
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,413
that is 100%
part of my strategy.

264
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:38,275
<i>Nobody else was catching fish
like I was.</i>

265
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,000
<i>So, I feel like Aquaman</i>

266
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:41,896
out there with my little spear.

267
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:45,862
My family's gonna
be so proud of me.

268
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:47,620
Oh, heck yeah, dude.

269
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,103
You're like a superhero, dude.
I keep saying it.

270
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:50,793
I think I could
survive out here.

271
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:54,413
That's why I'm going out here
and getting you guys fish,

272
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:58,620
even though, you know, next vote
it could be me, you know?

273
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:02,034
You know, you-you acknowledge
you're a-a big guy,

274
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,758
physically intimidating,
a little bit, right?

275
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:06,620
I hope people
don't see me as a threat.

276
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:09,482
Well, I think you
made quite the impression.

277
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,724
<i>Of course, they're
gonna see me as a threat</i>

278
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:13,862
<i>in the challenges,
but at the same time,</i>

279
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,448
I showed I'm a hard worker.

280
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:18,137
I'm willing to spend my calories
to get everybody else food,

281
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:21,068
<i>but not only that,
since I am part of the seven,</i>

282
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:23,827
<i>I can trust the alliance
that I have.</i>

283
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:26,034
Feel good. Do you feel
good about the seven, Cody?

284
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:27,137
Absolutely.

285
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:31,517
- Take the gloves off
and let's just throw punches.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

286
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,586
<i>With this newfound seven
of Cody, Jesse,</i>

287
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:38,896
<i>myself, Karla,
James, Ryan and Cassidy,</i>

288
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,413
where do I fall
Within that group?

289
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:45,620
- It's, like, the line
is, like, drawn, seven-four.
- Yeah. It really is.

290
00:11:45,724 --> 00:11:48,482
It would be stupid to say,

291
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:50,862
"That's the seven to go with
and then we make final seven."

292
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:53,241
- I'm not here
to play for final seven.
- No.

293
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:55,068
- I'm here to play to win.
- Play to win.

294
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,965
<i>I'm trying to set myself up</i>

295
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:59,655
at 19 to win this game.

296
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:02,586
<i>Not to make it to the end
and not get any respect.</i>

297
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,586
<i>That's not what I want to do.</i>

298
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,206
<i>I want to be in control
and make decisions</i>

299
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,827
for the rest of this game.

300
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,793
It's seven to four.
I don't want to go

301
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,827
get rid of you,
you, Gabler and Noelle.

302
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,724
Where does that leave me?
I'm at the bottom of the seven.

303
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:15,827
I don't want to be there.

304
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:17,034
You're seventh on there, like...

305
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,241
No, no, I know.

306
00:12:18,344 --> 00:12:20,034
I don't want to go that way.

307
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:21,827
- That's why
I'm talking to you guys.
- I know. I know, exactly...

308
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:23,827
At the end of the day,
we still have four with Gabler.

309
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:25,620
- Yeah.
- And then we have Noelle.

310
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:27,241
And then, at that point,
we're one off.

311
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:28,551
- We're one off.
- One more.

312
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,827
- All we need is six.
- All we need is six.

313
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,379
<i>Thank God.</i>

314
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:33,793
<i>I feel like my game
has a little bit of hope.</i>

315
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:36,310
<i>We just need one
other person to maybe try</i>

316
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:37,620
<i>to turn the tables and</i>

317
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,931
take down
some of the big players

318
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,551
who are starting
to get big heads right now.

319
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:43,517
That group thinks that
one of the four of you guys

320
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,137
- will probably just go home.
- Yeah.
- It's probably me.

321
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:47,068
- That's not
the way the game should go.
- No.

322
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:49,482
- That's not the way
I think the game should go.
- I agree. I agree.

323
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:51,275
<i>I feel like the seven</i>

324
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,068
is sitting pretty
on a sinking ship,

325
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:57,931
<i>but I need to act like
I'm still with that group.</i>

326
00:12:58,034 --> 00:12:59,793
<i>Otherwise, they're
gonna start to be suspicious.</i>

327
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:02,344
We're at war,
and I'm with the right folks.

328
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,172
That was the point, man. So...

329
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:05,379
I know.

330
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:09,965
It's one less person
to worry about.

331
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,758
- And at the end of the day...
- And he's definitely a flipper.

332
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:13,448
And those are the people
that are dangerous.

333
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:15,655
<i>On</i> Survivor,
<i>it's all about windows.</i>

334
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:17,586
It's all about,
"When am I gonna make my move?"

335
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,068
<i>And with a million freaking
dollars on the line,</i>

336
00:13:21,172 --> 00:13:22,551
<i>this game
is only gonna get crazier.</i>

337
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:26,379
The moves are only gonna
become shadier and

338
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:30,000
<i>more cutthroat. This is where
good players survive</i>

339
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:32,172
<i>and great players thrive.</i>

340
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:39,137
This adventure could be yours.
Apply to be on <i>Survivor.</i>

341
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,517
Come on in.

342
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:08,517
All right.

343
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,206
- Shall we get to it?
- Yes, sir.

344
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,448
First things first, Gabler,
got to take back the necklace.

345
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,517
- Yes, sir.
- You're gonna
make me take it off.

346
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,689
Yes, sir.

347
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:18,586
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

348
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:24,551
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

349
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,586
For today's challenge,

350
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:29,172
<i>you're gonna
balance a ball on a pole.</i>

351
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:30,620
<i>At regular intervals,</i>

352
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,068
<i>you're gonna
add another section of pole,</i>

353
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,517
<i>making it more difficult.</i>

354
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,310
<i>If at any point
your ball drops...</i>

355
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,724
<i>...you're out.</i>

356
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:41,793
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

357
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:44,206
guaranteed a spot
in the final ten.

358
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,379
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody

359
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:50,034
will be the eighth person
voted out of this game

360
00:14:50,137 --> 00:14:52,103
and the first member
of our jury.

361
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:55,000
So it's day 16,

362
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,862
and even though
we're still in the early days

363
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:00,344
of this still evolving
new era of <i>Survivor,</i>

364
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:02,413
there are
already certain markers

365
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:04,655
that the smart player
has identified.

366
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:07,172
Today is another
one of those markers.

367
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:14,034
There's enough rice in here
for four days for every player--

368
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:17,068
a lot longer if you ration it.

369
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:21,206
The established price
for this rice in this new era

370
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,000
is five players.

371
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:26,724
Still less than half of you
must sit out of this challenge,

372
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,206
give up your shot at immunity,

373
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,103
in exchange
for rice for everybody.

374
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:35,586
So take a minute. Walk me
through your thought process.

375
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,965
Jeff, can we do four players?

376
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,655
No.

377
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:44,103
I'll be fully transparent
in my negotiating approach.

378
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:48,724
Today is the only day
it will cost you five players.

379
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:50,482
Tomorrow it will be
more expensive.

380
00:15:53,758 --> 00:15:55,000
Nobody talking.

381
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm hungry.

382
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:58,103
- So I-I can.
- I'm game.

383
00:15:58,206 --> 00:15:59,724
- I don't mind.
- I...

384
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:02,172
My finger's busted.

385
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:04,275
- And this
is a gripping challenge.
- I mean...

386
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:05,655
I will-I will do it.

387
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,137
- I'll sit out.
- There's two.

388
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:08,724
- You'll sit out? I'll sit out.
- Yeah, my hand's...

389
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:10,551
There's three. There's four.

390
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:11,827
Yeah.

391
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:15,068
We need one more
to make this deal done.

392
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,689
Day 16. That is a lot of rice.

393
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:22,137
<i>- Uno más.</i> Taco Bell.
- That'll wake you up.

394
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:23,793
- That will give you energy.
- All right.

395
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:25,655
- I'll do it.
- And there goes Cassidy.
We have our five.

396
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:28,827
- Thank you, guys.
- James, Sami, Jesse,

397
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:31,793
Cassidy, Karla
agreeing to sit out.

398
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:34,862
Sami, that
was a pretty fast agreement

399
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:37,482
for five players with
a million dollars on the line.

400
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,000
Where are we in the game

401
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:41,482
that this group
is volunteering to do it

402
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:44,068
with no certainty that it won't
be you that goes home tonight?

403
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:45,517
Yeah, it's crazy, 'cause, like,

404
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,137
when you come out here,
you know,

405
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,758
"I want to compete,"

406
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:51,344
you know, "I'm this big guy.
Let me compete. Let me do it."

407
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:53,724
But, like, once you
get further down the road,

408
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:56,758
the-the deterioration
starts to take a toll on you.

409
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:58,241
Like, we're all deteriorated.
We're beat up.

410
00:16:58,344 --> 00:16:59,413
We're all just a little hungry.

411
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:01,034
And if it is us tonight,
it's us tonight,

412
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,655
but we're ready
to give up our spots

413
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:05,310
so we can all have a little
bit more food in our stomachs.

414
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:07,344
Five of you are sitting out.
That is a massive risk.

415
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:09,310
Maybe the tribe
will treat you respectfully

416
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:10,620
and not vote you out,

417
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:12,034
or maybe we'll have
a big blindside tonight.

418
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:15,896
Who knows? James, Sami,
Jesse, Cassidy, Karla,

419
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,310
you're on the bench.

420
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,206
- Thank you guys.
- Thank you, guys.

421
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,620
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

422
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:24,379
Everybody else
will draw for spots.

423
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:25,724
We'll get started.
Here we go.

424
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:28,310
Day 16, <i>Survivor 43.</i>

425
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:38,517
All right, we have our sit-outs.

426
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,310
Leaves us with six people
competing for immunity.

427
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:43,413
Let's begin.

428
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,551
Grab your first pole.

429
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:49,034
Put your ball on there.

430
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:51,551
All you have to do
for this first section

431
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,931
is to have
your hand under the paint.

432
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:56,931
- So you're either under the
white or you're under the black.
- Oh.

433
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,241
Just make sure
I can see a little gap.

434
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:02,206
Perfect. Everybody's good.

435
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,620
All right.
Let's add one section of pole.

436
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:07,586
You have 30 seconds
to pull this off.

437
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:10,655
This is a live transition,
which means

438
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:15,137
if your ball drops while you're
adding another section of pole,

439
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,034
you're still out.
There's no freebie.

440
00:18:21,172 --> 00:18:24,793
All you have to do now is move
your hand under the new coupler,

441
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,000
the lowest coupler.

442
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:30,068
Five, four,

443
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:33,758
three, two, one.

444
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,379
Everybody looks good.

445
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:43,793
All you have to do
is keep your ball on your pole.

446
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:45,896
That's it.

447
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:50,724
Every five minutes, we'll
add another section of pole.

448
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,655
The more pole,
the more difficult.

449
00:18:58,241 --> 00:19:00,586
All right, we're
gonna add another section.

450
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:04,758
Now you're gonna
feel the difficulty kick in.

451
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:07,482
This part
was probably pretty easy.

452
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:11,103
So long
as I can see that coupler

453
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:13,275
and no part
of your hand is above it,

454
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,689
you're in good shape.

455
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:17,620
Start working your way there.

456
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,896
Ryan's good. Gabler's good.

457
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,206
Jeanine can't
make the transition.

458
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,068
And Noelle,
right on the heels of Jeanine.

459
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:26,655
Both women are out.

460
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:31,000
Cody, Ryan, Gabler and Owen
all survive the transition.

461
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,275
- Good try.
- Good job. Good job.

462
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:35,551
Wow. Just like that.

463
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:37,689
Four players left.

464
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:50,758
All right, we're gonna get ready
to add another section.

465
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:54,137
You have 30 seconds.

466
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:58,482
Remember, you can't put
your hand above where it is now.

467
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,965
You can't really look down.

468
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:06,034
For fear of
taking your eyes off the prize.

469
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:07,275
So you've got to figure out

470
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:09,344
how to maneuver
that pole into its slot.

471
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:11,827
15 seconds.

472
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,931
Gabler's pole
with a lot of bend,

473
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:20,137
but that ball
still sitting okay.

474
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:21,896
- Damn.
- Nope. It won't hold.

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,344
Gabler's out.
We're down to three.

476
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:26,931
Five, four,

477
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:30,310
three, two, one...

478
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:32,724
You are all good.

479
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:36,000
Gabler will now join
the others on the bench.

480
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:38,344
No shot
at getting that necklace back.

481
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:41,862
We'll go five minutes
in this round.

482
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,689
All right,
we're gonna get ready

483
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:57,034
to add another section.

484
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:59,310
So start making your move.

485
00:21:03,724 --> 00:21:08,000
So these 30 seconds
are yours to use strategically.

486
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:11,827
Go early, or wait and hope
somebody drops and go late.

487
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:16,551
15 seconds left.

488
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:22,068
Ryan has made the transition.

489
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:24,793
Cody.

490
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:26,827
Seven seconds left.

491
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:28,793
Owen's got to get
his hand down under there.

492
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,896
Five, four,

493
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,034
three, two, one.

494
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:38,344
Everybody's done it again.

495
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:41,620
Cody took every
single second, wisely.

496
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:45,137
It is Cody, Ryan and Owen

497
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:47,344
now with a lot of pole.

498
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:50,551
My toes are asleep.

499
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:51,931
My left foot is on fire.

500
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:53,310
No!

501
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,655
Ryan drops.

502
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:57,413
Thought he had a strategy
using his forehead,

503
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:59,413
but it resulted in that pole

504
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:02,827
bending a little too much, and
we're down to a showdown now.

505
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:05,068
It will either be Cody

506
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:08,793
or Owen who wears
the immunity necklace.

507
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:20,689
Keep doing what you're doing.

508
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:22,413
I know you're getting tired.

509
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:24,172
I know you're on fire.

510
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:25,551
It's hot out here.

511
00:22:25,655 --> 00:22:27,344
Your hands
might be getting numb.

512
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:30,068
Your body's stiff.
You're afraid to move.

513
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:33,413
All of those things are part
of the design of this challenge.

514
00:22:33,517 --> 00:22:35,517
You have
to overcome it right now.

515
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:41,206
If your leg goes to sleep,
rely on the other one.

516
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:58,448
All right, get ready
to add another section of pole.

517
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,172
Think through this.

518
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:07,206
And your time starts now.

519
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,896
You have 30 seconds
to add another piece of pole.

520
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,965
You just need to make
this transition successfully

521
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:16,827
to stay alive.

522
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:24,413
Cody goes first.

523
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,000
Owen reaches
for his section of pole.

524
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:38,034
Owen locks in.

525
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:40,620
- Oh, my...
- Careful.

526
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:47,379
Cody drops,
can't make the transition.

527
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:50,931
- Owen wins individual immunity.
- Let's go! Oh, my God.

528
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:53,517
- Safe tonight
at Tribal Council.
- Amazing.

529
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,862
- Oh, my God.
- Guaranteed a spot
in the final ten.

530
00:23:55,965 --> 00:23:59,413
- Great effort
from both Cody and Owen.
- Both you guys. Amazing.

531
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:01,310
Nice job up there.

532
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:03,413
Cowboy Cody and Big O, good job.

533
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:05,793
- Wow,
that went a long time.
- Good job.

534
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:07,172
Great job, guys.

535
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:10,379
Owen, come on over.

536
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,965
Yes, sir.

537
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:13,206
Well-earned.

538
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,482
Thank you. Thank you.

539
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,482
- Holding that a long time.
- Yes, sir.

540
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:17,862
Oh, my God. Is this real life?

541
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:19,758
"Is this real life?"
What does that mean?

542
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:21,758
Walk me through that,
because I hear that

543
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:22,827
- so often in this moment.
- Yeah.

544
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:23,931
I mean, you're a little kid,

545
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,758
and you-you watch Colby,

546
00:24:25,862 --> 00:24:28,103
you watch Terry Deitz,
you watch Kelly Wiglesworth.

547
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:30,137
You watch everyone
winning all these necklaces.

548
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:31,758
- You're going old school.
- Old school, baby.

549
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:33,551
That was me, nine years old,
watching this show,

550
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:35,310
and I want to do that one day.

551
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:37,275
- And you're showing you can.
- And I'm not... I can.

552
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:38,758
I'm not the biggest,
I'm not the strongest,

553
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:40,896
but I-I just did that.

554
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,275
It's insane.

555
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:43,689
All right, Owen,
safe tonight at Tribal Council,

556
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,689
cannot be
voted out of this game.

557
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:48,068
As for the rest of you,
somebody going home tonight--

558
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:50,275
eighth person voted out,
first member of our jury.

559
00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:51,965
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp. See you tonight at Tribal.

560
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:53,448
- Congrats.
- Can I give you a hug, man?

561
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:55,655
- Yeah, of course. Congrats.
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

562
00:24:55,758 --> 00:24:56,931
- Enjoy that necklace.
- Thank you, Jeff.

563
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:59,103
- Oh, my God.
- Animal.

564
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,551
<i>Owen won immunity,
which puts me, Noelle</i>

565
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:05,068
<i>and Jeanine in the hot seat.</i>

566
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,448
<i>I think the majority alliance
smell blood.</i>

567
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:09,517
I'm trying to find safe harbor,

568
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,000
<i>because as long as
my name doesn't hit parchment,</i>

569
00:25:12,103 --> 00:25:13,620
<i>I'm moving forward.</i>

570
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,172
Yeah, baby.

571
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:31,517
Good job, Ryan.

572
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,344
Yeah, Ryan. Great job, Owen.

573
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,689
- Nice work, buddy.
- Thank you.

574
00:25:35,793 --> 00:25:38,206
<i>Winning today is just</i>

575
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,310
such a huge sigh of relief.
I've voted incorrectly

576
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:43,137
<i>the past two Tribal Councils.</i>

577
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,758
<i>And whether or not</i>

578
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:47,068
<i>the seven versus four
is the reality out here,</i>

579
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,517
it's safe to say
I'm towards the bottom.

580
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,000
We're gonna eat, right?

581
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:52,758
- Yeah.
- A cup of rice
for everybody.

582
00:25:52,862 --> 00:25:54,448
- Let's get a good meal.
- Do the same cup,
and then, like...

583
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:55,758
<i>At the immunity challenge,</i>

584
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:58,379
<i>Jeff was asking
for five to sit out,</i>

585
00:25:58,482 --> 00:26:00,620
<i>and James turns
and looks at me, and he says,</i>

586
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:02,931
<i>"You're protected."
Like, spare me that crap.</i>

587
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:04,655
I thought that
was pretty patronizing.

588
00:26:04,758 --> 00:26:07,758
So that gave me a little
extra fire to-to win today.

589
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:09,586
<i>But I know this is temporary.</i>

590
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:10,965
<i>I don't want to get too cocky.</i>

591
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:12,344
<i>I need to get my footing,</i>

592
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:14,206
get a majority
and find myself

593
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,620
on the right side
of the numbers.

594
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:18,827
I'm gonna go fish
in about 30 minutes to an hour.

595
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:21,586
I just need to talk to you guys
and get everything situated,

596
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:23,344
- so I'm not... Yeah.
- Before you go out.

597
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:35,586
So, just...
- That's why she didn't sit out.

598
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:37,103
- If she had something,
she would have sat out.
- Yeah.

599
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:38,379
<i>Owen won the immunity challenge.</i>

600
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:40,931
Great for him,
and horrible for Jeanine.

601
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,965
<i>Now that she doesn't
have her immunity idol,</i>

602
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,482
<i>Jeanine's gonna go home.</i>

603
00:26:45,448 --> 00:26:46,551
Yeah.

604
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:47,724
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah. I'm down.

605
00:26:47,827 --> 00:26:49,724
So, uh...

606
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,034
- So we're all good.
- Okay.

607
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:56,689
<i>Jeanine's
the vote tonight because</i>

608
00:26:56,793 --> 00:26:59,793
<i>she's definitely a smart mind,
a puzzle threat</i>

609
00:26:59,896 --> 00:27:02,241
and also a threat to slide
under the radar.

610
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:03,862
Right now, it's fine.

611
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:05,620
We'll get Jeanine out, 'cause
she's not part of anything,

612
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,862
- and she's really smart.
- If we can...

613
00:27:08,482 --> 00:27:10,000
- And I-I agree.
- So... Awesome.

614
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:11,275
- Well, then
I'll keep a pulse over here
- And I...

615
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,482
- while you're out there.
- Yeah.

616
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:13,620
Just let me know
if you hear anything.

617
00:27:13,724 --> 00:27:14,655
If anything changes.

618
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,517
<i>I want an unanimous vote.</i>

619
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,862
I just went and double-checked
it with everybody.

620
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:20,482
Took about ten, 15 minutes.

621
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:22,965
<i>Now I can go out into the water
for two and a half hours,</i>

622
00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:26,103
<i>because part of me
really wants to show them that</i>

623
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:28,862
rice is nice,
but fish is a little bit better.

624
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,379
<i>I think Jeanine,
just because she is such</i>

625
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:34,344
a free agent,
she's gonna align with somebody,

626
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:36,344
and it's gonna
bite us in the ass.

627
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,068
And everybody said they'd
like to keep the seven strong.

628
00:27:38,172 --> 00:27:40,448
We made the bed. We just
got to sleep in it one night.

629
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:41,758
<i>Last Tribal was really crazy.</i>

630
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:43,379
<i>People were running
around the beach</i>

631
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:45,034
like Jean-Claude Van Damme.

632
00:27:45,137 --> 00:27:46,827
We can simplify
this game to an extent.

633
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,586
Like, there can be
some simple votes.

634
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:50,137
<i>But right now, we're cruising.</i>

635
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:52,275
<i>You know,
this alliance with seven,</i>

636
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,620
I believe we're
running the game right now.

637
00:27:53,724 --> 00:27:55,655
We have full control.
We're steering the boat.

638
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:00,413
I just want it
to look sick as hell.

639
00:28:00,517 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, it's
got to be sick as hell.

640
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:05,206
Yeah, we are
definitely outdoing ourselves.

641
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,931
That is a work of art.

642
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:10,689
"Proposterous.
Live 2 Get Radical."

643
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:12,896
Who wouldn't want
to hang out with us?

644
00:28:14,896 --> 00:28:16,241
<i>This group of seven,
we're already talking about,</i>

645
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:17,655
<i>"Let's not mess up a good thing.</i>

646
00:28:17,758 --> 00:28:19,448
<i>- We already did this."</i>
- Oh, it's beautiful.

647
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:22,724
<i>But I want to screw up
this entire operation</i>

648
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:25,310
to try to make a move
and try to kind of break away

649
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,896
and make this game my own.

650
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,827
It's gonna be... It's supposed
to be you. Ryan wants you.

651
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:30,448
It's not gonna be you tonight.

652
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:35,103
We got to get more people,
because then we turn it.

653
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:37,034
- They're down on numbers.
- Uh-huh.

654
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:38,275
We're good.

655
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:39,379
I'm telling you...

656
00:28:40,793 --> 00:28:42,137
<i>You also have to be careful,</i>

657
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,172
<i>because you got
to move more in silence</i>

658
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:47,068
<i>to make these bigger-scale
moves. But I think</i>

659
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:50,310
getting out Ryan
would make the damage control,

660
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:53,413
<i>with that group that
I just ditched, a lot easier.</i>

661
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:55,172
<i>He's not really
making tight bonds</i>

662
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,206
<i>with anybody,
except for the fish.</i>

663
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,275
<i>Ryan loves the fish,
and the fish love Ryan.</i>

664
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:02,758
How do you feel about that?

665
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:04,172
I need to ask you
a serious question.

666
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,620
Okay.

667
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:09,620
What would you think
if we flipped it on to Ryan?

668
00:29:10,758 --> 00:29:13,344
Because I know that
that's-that's in that seven,

669
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:14,931
and I don't want
to make it seem like

670
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:16,793
- I'm trying to
break off that already, right?
- Mm-hmm.

671
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:19,172
You know, at this point,
it's an individual game.

672
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:20,827
Ryan is a big threat.

673
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:22,965
Even though he's Coco, that
doesn't matter to me, you know?

674
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:24,068
You're serious
about that, right?

675
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:26,758
<i>I'm excited about
possibly blindsiding Ryan</i>

676
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:28,413
<i>because it's a great move,</i>

677
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,103
it's a big move. We get a guy
out, we get a strong guy out,

678
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:34,068
<i>but that might be questionable
for some of the people</i>

679
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,551
<i>in my alliance, in the seven.</i>

680
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:37,000
We need to get Ryan out.

681
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:42,241
- I know you are.
- I'm-I'm rocking out
whatever you want to do.

682
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:43,620
<i>I love the kid,
but he doesn't...</i>

683
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:46,172
Where's he at right now?
He's fishing.

684
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:48,344
He's been gone for a few hours,
bro. Like, strategize,

685
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:50,793
<i>right?
Like, we finally have rice.</i>

686
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:53,241
<i>I don't care about your fish.</i>

687
00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:55,034
Aah! Freaking spines.

688
00:29:55,137 --> 00:29:56,413
They're in my pockets.

689
00:29:58,206 --> 00:29:59,310
- I'm with you. Yes.
- I'm with you.
I'm with you, too.

690
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:00,413
All right.

691
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:01,793
- All right, sounds good.
- Jesse!

692
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,344
Would we be down
to go with Ryan?

693
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:04,896
I-I mean, I'd be down.

694
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,689
I'd be down, bro.
I mean, he's...

695
00:30:06,793 --> 00:30:08,862
I don't think
Cass likes him very much.

696
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:12,896
Like, I feel
like we could do damage.

697
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,206
- Yeah.
- And I know
Ryan has it out for me.

698
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,965
I mean, I don't want you to go.

699
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:19,344
- Yeah.
- So for my game,
I would say Ryan goes.

700
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:21,793
- I-I've wanted to get Ryan out
for a long time.
- Yeah.

701
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:23,758
- Well, he's been out
to get you for a long time.
- Yes.

702
00:30:23,862 --> 00:30:25,758
<i>I know that
I'm on the chopping block,</i>

703
00:30:25,862 --> 00:30:27,137
<i>but I'm not willing to bargain.</i>

704
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:29,482
I'm not willing
to succumb to the majority.

705
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:32,724
Okay. Yeah. Done.

706
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:35,620
Hopefully he can catch
some nice, beautiful fish.

707
00:30:35,724 --> 00:30:37,275
- Before he goes?
- Yes.

708
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:40,275
<i>I need to secure
some sort of shift in the game.</i>

709
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:44,172
There are enough people here
and enough voices that we could

710
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,620
<i>work together and
we'll all just vote Ryan out.</i>

711
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:49,448
If it's Jeanine, you can tell
me, and I won't say anymore.

712
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,379
- We're voting Ryan,
and it is what it is.
- Okay. Cool.

713
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,827
- Just got to, you know...
- Yeah.

714
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:54,586
This is a great time.

715
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,068
<i>It seems like
everyone's on board.</i>

716
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,137
So, were you still
thinking Ryan?

717
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:02,689
I think that could work.

718
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:04,379
I think it could be pulled off.

719
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:06,241
To me, this is
a very obvious one.

720
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:14,310
But right now, it's like,
you take the numbers,

721
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:16,034
you use the numbers
that you have.

722
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:18,896
The only question, does Jeanine
have anything up her sleeve?

723
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,965
I'm just saying we made a plan.

724
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:23,137
- Let's stick to it.
- I think she's scary.
I really think she's scary.

725
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:24,448
I agree with Cody.

726
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,482
<i>So the more
I think about the vote,</i>

727
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,551
the devil you know is better
than the devil you don't know.

728
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:31,551
<i>And the thing about
sacrificing Ryan tonight,</i>

729
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,793
Ryan's a vote with me,
as of right now,

730
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:36,724
<i>and he has trusted me,
as of right now.</i>

731
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:39,793
I don't know.

732
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:40,758
I want to make everybody
in our seven feel comfortable.

733
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:42,482
She's not a big threat.

734
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:44,724
I just feel like that's a vote
we could always do later.

735
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:47,896
I think we need to get out more
immediate threats right now.

736
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,448
Who are you wanting? You want
to take these, like, big...

737
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,724
- Just because you want them
to be, like, competitors?
- I don't.

738
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:54,862
I just don't...

739
00:31:58,413 --> 00:32:00,448
Does it not frustrate you to see
the girls picked off one by one?

740
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:01,655
Mm-hmm.

741
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:06,482
There are people here that are
strong, yes, but also athletic.

742
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:09,034
- Like...
- But J-Jeanine may be athletic.

743
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,068
Just never mind.
It doesn't, it doesn't matter.

744
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:12,965
- I feel like this conversation
isn't getting anywhere.
- No, it's cool.

745
00:32:13,068 --> 00:32:14,724
<i>I want to get
my revenge on Ryan.</i>

746
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:16,931
<i>He's burned me in the past
and tried to vote for me,</i>

747
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:20,068
so he's proven that
I can't fully trust him. He also

748
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,586
<i>is a threat in challenges.</i>

749
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,793
21!

750
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,034
All right, dude.

751
00:32:24,137 --> 00:32:25,758
Wow.

752
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:27,310
<i>And voting out a guy right now</i>

753
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:30,103
would allow the women to gain
a little bit of momentum

754
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:32,965
<i>and have a little bit stronger
of numbers going forward.</i>

755
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:34,275
<i>I'm tired
of seeing women go home.</i>

756
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:35,724
<i>I know that's
nobody's intention,</i>

757
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:37,137
<i>but it's frustrating to me.</i>

758
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:39,482
We need to ...
take control of this.

759
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:40,793
I know.

760
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:42,206
<i>It seems like Ryan and Jeanine,</i>

761
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,620
<i>everyone could agree
on one or the other,</i>

762
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:45,758
<i>but I don't think
Ryan would have my back</i>

763
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:47,172
<i>more than Jeanine.</i>

764
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:49,793
I am truly a ship
looking for safe harbor.

765
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:51,448
I just want to know what's
going on with the majority,

766
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:53,931
- so that I write
the right stuff.
- We-we still don't know, even.

767
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:55,413
<i>Everyone seems scared</i>

768
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,137
<i>of being on
the wrong side of the votes.</i>

769
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,758
<i>If there's, like,
a unanimous decision on</i>

770
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:01,482
one or the other, it's like,
maybe we should just go with it

771
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:02,655
<i>instead of
trying to rock the boat.</i>

772
00:33:02,758 --> 00:33:04,206
They told me Ryan, too.

773
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,896
Is this actually... Is...

774
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,103
I don't know, Jeanine.

775
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:09,103
No, no, no, no, no, no.

776
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:11,068
I might actually
have to trust James.

777
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:12,965
<i>But I'm ready
to fight for my game,</i>

778
00:33:13,068 --> 00:33:14,965
<i>so sometimes
you have to rock the boat.</i>

779
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:16,896
Like, this is a cutthroat game.

780
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:47,413
All right, let's start
with a big topic.

781
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:51,793
Every season of <i>Survivor</i>
has a unique social contract

782
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,172
that is established,

783
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,620
designed, built
and executed by the players.

784
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:58,827
You all decide,
"Okay, here are the rules."

785
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:01,448
So, Gabler,
does this group have a sense

786
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:04,137
of what the established
social contract is?

787
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,310
I think so, Jeff.

788
00:34:05,413 --> 00:34:08,103
It's been a relationship game,

789
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:10,448
and when you step
outside of that, especially

790
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,482
if you're starting to get
too aggressive with gameplay,

791
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:13,896
you kind of
get cracked into line.

792
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,379
So it has to be subtle.

793
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:17,965
And with every Tribal Council,
we learn a lot more

794
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:19,758
about those social constructs

795
00:34:19,862 --> 00:34:22,620
and those borders and
where they're gonna be crossed.

796
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:25,379
Karla, do you agree
with Gabler's assessment?

797
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,758
I do agree that
there is some subtlety,

798
00:34:27,862 --> 00:34:30,551
but at the same time, you can't
be subtle the entire time.

799
00:34:30,655 --> 00:34:31,931
You know? Like,

800
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,275
how will people know
what moves you're making?

801
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:35,931
How will the jury
know who to vote for?

802
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,896
Ryan, does this
line up with the way

803
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,379
you're seeing the gameplay?

804
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:41,827
I think, this season,
we're comfortable enough to say,

805
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:44,517
"Hey, let's slow down, and
we'll get to playing the game."

806
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,241
But right now, a lot of people

807
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:48,517
are trying to step back
and enjoy what's around them

808
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,620
and enjoy the experience
they're having.

809
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:52,620
So, Owen,
that begs the question,

810
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,620
are people staying in line
because you all

811
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:56,413
actually share
the same philosophy?

812
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:59,517
Or is the player saying,

813
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,827
"I'm reading the room.
I need to just lay low"?

814
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:04,931
I think, truthfully,
it's more of the latter.

815
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:07,275
I don't think all of us are
out swimming for three hours

816
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:09,517
the way Ryan is, necessarily.

817
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,241
But foolishly,
last Tribal Council,

818
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:13,655
I tried jumping
in front of Dwight

819
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:14,896
from getting run over
by the bus.

820
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,310
So now, at this point, I just,

821
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:19,586
I don't care if I'm in
the wayback seat of the bus.

822
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:21,655
I don't care
if I'm sitting anywhere.

823
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:24,034
Terrible seat,
gum under the seat, whatever,

824
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:26,206
I just want
to be on the bus this time.

825
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,862
But at the same time, the last
two people that went home

826
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:30,482
had no idea
they were going home.

827
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,379
And so, there's a lot of game

828
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:34,310
being played, a lot
of conversations being had.

829
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:36,413
Everybody that's sitting here
is playing this game.

830
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:38,724
Everybody's just playing
it a little bit differently.

831
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:41,172
Cassidy, do you like
the way this game is playing?

832
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:43,103
Yeah, I mean, for me,

833
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:44,827
my gameplay is
maybe a little bit more subtle,

834
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:47,172
but that doesn't mean that I'm
not making big moves, you know?

835
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:49,344
It's just about
keeping trust with the people

836
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:50,724
that I want to work with.

837
00:35:50,827 --> 00:35:51,931
How about you, James?

838
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:54,000
Last Tribal,
there were a lot of lines

839
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:55,413
that may have been drawn,

840
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:57,689
but each day
a new line can be drawn,

841
00:35:57,793 --> 00:35:59,448
and you're
trying to make sure

842
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:02,689
that you're drawing the proper
line for you to move forward.

843
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,482
Jeanine, James just said it.

844
00:36:04,586 --> 00:36:07,517
The thing that
really complicates

845
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,689
these <i>Survivor</i> societies
is that they're fluid.

846
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,448
So how do you play this game
knowing that what was

847
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:17,000
true yesterday,
or even this morning,

848
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:19,586
may not be true
right now, this evening?

849
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:22,137
Yeah. Like we've all
been talking about,

850
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:23,896
there has been
a culture established,

851
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,413
but just as much as
it was easy for us to all

852
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,896
kind of opt into that culture,
it could change and shift.

853
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,034
And you have to understand
when that's happening

854
00:36:32,137 --> 00:36:33,379
and go with the momentum there.

855
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,896
Gabler, what do you do

856
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,448
when you talk to two people,
and they say, "Plan A,"

857
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:38,896
and you talk to two more people,
and they go,

858
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,344
"No, no, we're doing plan B."

859
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,827
Oh, well, that's...
that was my day.

860
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:45,034
I mean, it's been
plan A, plan B,

861
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:47,344
plan A for sure, back to B.

862
00:36:47,448 --> 00:36:49,206
It's bounced around
a little bit.

863
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,620
So, yeah, tonight's
gonna be interesting.

864
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:52,655
I think it's gonna
put a little bit more

865
00:36:52,758 --> 00:36:54,379
into focus for tomorrow.

866
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:56,724
Cody, when you feel comfortable,

867
00:36:56,827 --> 00:37:00,413
does that make you more nervous
that you're feeling comfortable?

868
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:02,068
I get more nervous
when I'm comfortable.

869
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:03,896
And, for example,
when we got back today,

870
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,724
I'm thinking,
we're starting the rice.

871
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:07,137
Get the pot on there, let's eat.

872
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:09,137
And I'm sitting by the firepit,

873
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:10,827
and I look around,
and there's nobody around.

874
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:12,931
I'm going, "What, do I have
to go herd cats out here?"

875
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:14,862
I thought we were
gonna smash some rice

876
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:16,517
and then
go have our conversations.

877
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,241
I was trying to talk to people
quick, so I can go out and fish.

878
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:22,793
- So, we...
- He caught 22 fish today.

879
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:24,517
- 22 fish. 21 fish today.
- 21.

880
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,862
21?

881
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:28,000
That's a lot of fish.

882
00:37:28,103 --> 00:37:29,965
I'm still not 100% comfortable.

883
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:31,896
I felt, you know,
I'm gonna try my luck

884
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,379
with the waters,
and if I bring back a bounty,

885
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:36,310
then they'll
keep me in the game.

886
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:38,310
Jeanine, were you
comfortable today?

887
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:39,793
No, I think it's pretty obvious.

888
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:42,034
There were lines
drawn at last Tribal,

889
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:44,448
and I was not
in the majority vote.

890
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:47,896
and so I'm-I'm definitely
not comfortable tonight.

891
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,551
So what did you do today?
Ryan went fishing.

892
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:52,758
For me, it was really just about

893
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:55,000
trying to connect
with as many people as possible

894
00:37:55,103 --> 00:37:57,310
and lean on the relationships
that I think I can out here.

895
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:59,068
But there's never any way

896
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:01,172
to tell if someone's
telling you the truth.

897
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:03,724
You really just
have to trust your gut.

898
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:06,586
You know, this game,
I learned today, Jeff,

899
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,655
it's a game of centimeters,
or even less.

900
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:10,413
And those same centimeters

901
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:12,413
don't only carry over
into the challenges,

902
00:38:12,517 --> 00:38:15,551
but they also carry into
the conversations that we have.

903
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:18,206
And just
misinterpreting one word,

904
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,896
- Wow.
- one body posture, can change
the whole outcome as well.

905
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,965
So I-I don't know
where I'm going with this,

906
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,620
at the end of the day,
but it's...

907
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:29,137
Well, I was tracking every
bit of it, and it scares me.

908
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:33,275
So, Sami, the vibe of the tribe
is pretty clear.

909
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,586
The group is saying, "Listen,

910
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:37,000
"we have agreed
to play a certain way.

911
00:38:37,103 --> 00:38:40,103
"Make your moves quietly.
Be respectful of time.

912
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:41,758
He wants to fish,
let him do it."

913
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,517
And what I would be thinking
as a player is,

914
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,206
"What do I do
other than just trust?"

915
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,275
I feel like we're
all talking about trust,

916
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:50,344
and it's, like,
such a fishy word.

917
00:38:50,448 --> 00:38:52,103
Like, it's
a whole bunch of nonsense.

918
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,551
It's a crock of crap at this
point, you know what I mean?

919
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:57,620
Like, these rules
are being curved.

920
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:00,172
They're being amended
all the time.

921
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:02,413
And I think it's gonna
continue to be that way.

922
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:04,586
I think that
it's gonna be a damn civil war.

923
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:07,241
The rules are gonna
be outright broken all around,

924
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:09,275
and it's gonna
be crazy chaos around here.

925
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:14,862
All right, it is time to vote.

926
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:16,758
Cody, you're up.

927
00:39:30,517 --> 00:39:31,896
You're a wonderful girl.

928
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,655
You need to start
embracing yourself

929
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:36,793
and being the leader
I know you can be.

930
00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:20,965
If anybody has
an advantage or an idol

931
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:23,172
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

932
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:29,965
Okay, I'll read the votes.

933
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,620
First vote, Jeanine.

934
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:38,896
Ryan.

935
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:43,241
Ryan.

936
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:50,344
Jeanine.

937
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,000
We're tied. Two votes Ryan,
two votes Jeanine.

938
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,620
Jeanine.
That's three votes Jeanine,

939
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:00,827
two votes Ryan.

940
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:07,586
Jeanine.

941
00:41:07,689 --> 00:41:09,655
Four votes Jeanine,
two votes Ryan.

942
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:15,310
Jeanine.
That's five votes Jeanine.

943
00:41:18,379 --> 00:41:20,448
Eighth person voted out and
the first member of our jury,

944
00:41:20,551 --> 00:41:21,793
Jeanine.
That's six. That's enough.

945
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,103
You need to bring me your torch.

946
00:41:25,827 --> 00:41:27,206
All love.

947
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,034
- All love. All love.
- Bye, Jeanine.

948
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:38,586
Jeanine, the tribe has spoken.

949
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,241
Time for you to go.

950
00:41:42,344 --> 00:41:43,862
- See you guys in the real world.
- Bye, Jeanine.

951
00:41:43,965 --> 00:41:45,379
Bye, girl.

952
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,413
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

953
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:53,965
Good night.

If you break trust with James,
you go home.

957
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:27,517
I woke up this morning
wanting to make a big move.

958
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,655
There are
two immunity necklaces.

959
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:31,655
Two people going home.

960
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,068
<i>I'm ready
to change this game up.</i>

961
00:42:33,172 --> 00:42:34,000
We're on the Autobahn
to the million dollars.

962
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:40,241
<i>Dwight leaving with my idol
had a major impact on my game,</i>

963
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:44,103
<i>but I can't look back
on any of it and not smile.</i>

964
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:46,103
<i>I truly do feel
like I've learned</i>

965
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:48,206
<i>more about myself
these last 16 days.</i>

966
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,344
<i>And I've challenged
myself physically, mentally,</i>

967
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:52,172
<i>in every possible way.</i>

968
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:55,413
<i>I can't describe it
any more than gratitude</i>

969
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:56,896
and contentment.
