00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:30,793
is on.

335
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:37,655
This is a classic
<i>Survivor</i> challenge.

336
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:41,103
This is unique
every time we run it.

337
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,620
Every day
in the ocean is different.

338
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:49,551
You might start with
a higher tide or a lower tide.

339
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:52,448
Everybody looking good.

340
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:55,724
Still have plenty
of breathing room at this point.

341
00:16:57,172 --> 00:16:59,724
Owen, how you feeling right now?

342
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:02,655
OWEN: It's unbelievable.
I'm happy to be here.

343
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:04,758
You always want to try this one.

344
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,862
- Yeah.
- [laughing]

345
00:17:07,965 --> 00:17:10,413
PROBST:
That's easy to say

346
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:12,034
until a swell comes.

347
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,793
[inhales sharply]

348
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:23,517
PROBST:
I can see from looks on faces,

349
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,241
you're already uncomfortable.

350
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,000
Claustrophobia is
probably the first thing.

351
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:31,965
The tide hasn't risen that much,

352
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:35,000
but you get little swells
like that.

353
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:40,896
Moment by moment,
that tide is rising.

354
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,724
Make no mistake about it.

355
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,241
Your breathing room
is decreasing.

356
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:50,482
And Gabler can't take it anymore.

357
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:54,620
Gabler is the first person out.
We are down to six.

358
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:58,310
If Cody bet on Gabler,
that bet is over.

359
00:17:58,413 --> 00:18:00,344
But only Cody knows
who he bet on.

360
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:02,793
[coughing]

361
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:05,896
Obviously, a big advantage
in this challenge is

362
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,517
how comfortable are you
in the water in general?

363
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,965
Not everybody grows up surfing.

364
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:15,689
Another swell.

365
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:21,000
- [Sami groans]
- Sami, out of nowhere

366
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:23,689
takes a swell,
can't take anymore.

367
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:26,965
And we are down to five.

368
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:28,896
Those are the moments
that get you.

369
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,724
The swell is too much.
It lasts too long.

370
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:37,620
PROBST: You're underwater longer
than you feel comfortable,

371
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:39,344
and you just pop out.

372
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:43,517
And there it comes
just like that.

373
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,517
Another swell.

374
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,517
Some of these swells are fast,
some of them

375
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,068
really take their time.

376
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:06,034
Wow.

377
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:10,310
Another big, slow swell.

378
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:13,000
This is impressive.

379
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:22,724
PROBST:
That was a long time underwater.

380
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:25,551
Jesse's out,
and we're down to four.

381
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:29,586
Karla, Owen, Cody and Cassidy.

382
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:31,310
GABLER:
Great job, buddy.

383
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:32,965
We're getting down to it now.

384
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:36,724
That water is rising.

385
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,758
Immunity on the line.

386
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:40,655
This is old school <i>Survivor.</i>

387
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:43,620
Back when we inflicted
a little more pain.

388
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:49,827

It's exhausting
to be doing this right now.

392

Everybody wants it to be over.

393

This is constant.

This is the most difficult
stage so far.

401

A far cry from when we started.

402

Still underwater.

That's the panic.

406

Everybody's underwater. Unbelievable.

He's still underwater.
He's still good.

- Cody can't do it. He's out!

We're down to three.

414
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,206
Now the question for Cody is,

415
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,965
what name did he secretly
write down?

416
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:28,137
Was it Karla, Owen or Cassidy?

417
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:30,586
If so,
he's still got another shot.

418
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,655
Cody, you freezing?

- OWEN: Oh, my gosh.

511

Try to start warming up.
- Thank you so much.

- Nice job, brother.

513
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,689
All right, Karla, Owen,
you have made it to six.

Cody still has a

which will be revealed tonight
after you vote,

516
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:22,896
but before the votes are read.

517
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,172
And then you have a whole bunch
of scrambling back at camp.

518
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:26,965
All right, swim out.
See you tonight at Tribal.

524
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:39,172

three people off of the table

571
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:43,310
"Karla has an idol," and that
will blow up my entire game.

as really bad
as-as this sounds...

574
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:55,137
is to get my number-one ally
out of the game.

575
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:58,241
Let's do, uh... Cass?

576

is this real?
- Uh, yeah.

577

- Yeah.

- Okay.

00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:15,275
The way that you were
with me yesterday--

584
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,827
I appreciated that, that's good.

00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:18,551

comes out of the bag

589

- Interesting.

591
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:30,965
<i>SAMI:
But for now,
to hear Cass' name,</i>

592
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:33,172
it-it has a nice
little ring to it.

593
00:29:33,275 --> 00:29:34,931
- My guess is Cass.
- Okay.

594
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:36,586
That's who I want to go.
Go Cass.

595
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:38,655
- Karla's got to be next.
- Yeah.

596
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:41,758
If you look at the alliances
right now, you've got, you know,

597
00:29:41,862 --> 00:29:44,413
Cass and-and Karla are tight.

598
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:46,586
If you were gonna do
anything, you'd go Cassidy now,

599
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:48,551
- Karla tomorrow.
- Yeah.

600
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:51,068
A lot of people are starting
to lean towards, you know, just

601
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:54,241
<i>taking out Cassidy because Cass
and Karla are this tight pair.</i>

602
00:29:54,344 --> 00:29:55,862
<i>And maybe</i>

603
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:57,034
I need to just go with the flow.

604
00:29:57,137 --> 00:29:58,413
- What are you thinking?
- Okay.

605
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:03,275
<i>JESSE: But at this point,</i>

606
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:04,862
Karla wants
to get rid of Cassidy.

607
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:06,206
So you're on board with Cass?

608
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,931
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

609
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:09,758
<i>JESSE:
The fact that Karla is on board</i>

610
00:30:09,862 --> 00:30:11,344
<i>sort of set off,
like, a little bit</i>

611
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:14,724
<i>of, like, alarm bells in my head
because it just means that</i>

612
00:30:14,827 --> 00:30:17,758
<i>Karla doesn't see Cassidy as,
like, a key piece in her game.</i>

613
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:19,724
I mean, I'm also
okay with Sami, but...

614
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,724
No.

615
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:25,724
<i>JESSE: Then she's starting
to build new bridges</i>

616
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:29,517
<i>with Sami, and Sami is a threat
for, you know, other reasons.</i>

617
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,586
Sami's, like,
this amazing fire magician.

618
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:34,034
- You want me to start fire?
- Yeah.

619
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:36,034
<i>JESSE:
Nobody wants to go up
against Sami on fire,</i>

620
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:37,620
<i>and nobody trusts him.</i>

621
00:30:37,724 --> 00:30:40,068
<i>He's kind of flip-floppy,
wishy-washy, so, like,</i>

622
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,206
maybe now's the time
to take out Sami.

623
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,448
Cody's pushing for Cass, I think
Gabler's on board, and...

624
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:50,448
- To vote Cass?
- To vote Cass.

625
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:51,931
OWEN: Wow.

626
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:55,482
OWEN: Yeah.

627
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:59,000
Ooh. To help drive a wedge?

628
00:30:59,103 --> 00:31:02,206
Then they're going at
each other's throats next time.

629
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,034
- Yeah?
- And then we can count on Cass
to vote Karla next time.

630
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:05,793
Hell, yeah.

631
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:07,931
<i>JESSE:
Sami-- I don't want him
to slip through.</i>

632
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,551
<i>OWEN:
No, I 100% agree with you.</i>

633
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:14,655

- But this is where it changes.

634
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:16,172
Yeah.

635
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:17,103
<i>So I'm okay
with taking out Sami tonight,</i>

636
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:18,620
<i>but Jesse--</i>

637
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:21,275
<i>he flipped on Dwight,
he flipped on Noelle.</i>

638
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,620
He's stabbed me
in the back before.

639
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:23,931
And as much as I like the guy,

640
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:25,827
<i>I don't know if I can trust him.</i>

641
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:29,379
- Good.
- I'm gonna talk to Cody
and try and get him to see...

642
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:31,517
- And I'll talk to Gabler,
try to do the same.
- Yeah.

643
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,965
<i>OWEN:
Voting correctly tonight
is crucial to my game,</i>

644
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:37,172
but if I think
it's gonna be that simple,

645
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:39,172
I could be played
for a fool once again.

646
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:40,620
<i>JESSE:
What if</i>

647
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:43,655
instead of voting Cass--
because, honestly,

648
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:47,448
she's not a huge threat--
what if we vote Sami out?

649
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:52,655
And we don't fill Karla in

650
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:55,241
so she's the only one
that votes Cass.

651
00:31:55,344 --> 00:32:00,068
So that when they come back,
they're at odds.

652
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:04,344
<i>CODY: When Jesse pitched the
idea of, let's vote out Sami</i>

653
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:06,620
<i>so we can put Karla
on her own little island</i>

654
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,379
<i>and make her look
on the wrong side of the vote,</i>

655
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:11,103
it makes me think.
You know, like, something...

656
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:12,965
And that's where we-- me
and Jesse-- get along so well,

657
00:32:13,068 --> 00:32:14,862
is we think
of other options, right?

658
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:17,068
Because sometimes the clear-cut
one is not always the best one.

659
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:25,241
Yeah? Ooh.

660
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,965
<i>Lucky for me, Owen won</i>

661
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:30,310
<i>the immunity challenge,

662
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:33,413
<i>But in my mind,
it's time for Cassidy to go.</i>

663
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:35,827
<i>Like, I think we need
to split up Cassidy and Karla.</i>

664
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:37,896
- I don't trust him.
- I don't trust him.

665
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,793
I feel like... Really?

666
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:41,413
CODY:
I get it. He's a fire threat,

667
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:43,965
but he's also a challenge loser.

668
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:45,586
He's the first one out
all the time.

669
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:47,034
Cassie's won immunity.

670
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:50,310
She's almost...
She put up a good fight today.

♪ ♪

680
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:39,655
All right, so let's start
by talking about

681
00:33:39,758 --> 00:33:41,827
today's historic challenge.

682
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:43,827
Karla and Owen,

683
00:33:43,931 --> 00:33:47,689
we've never had anybody
outlast an entire high tide.

684
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,793
As a result, Karla and Owen
are both safe tonight.

685
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:54,275
And we still have a question
with Cody,

686
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:56,827
who found the
Choose Your Champion Advantage.

687
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:58,379
If he bet on either Owen

688
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:00,758
or Karla, then Cody
is safe tonight as well.

689
00:34:00,862 --> 00:34:03,793
So there's a lot going on.

690
00:34:03,896 --> 00:34:06,310
And this afternoon,
I was thinking about you all

691
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:08,137
after spending three hours

692
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:10,965
watching that tide
rise and fall.

693
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:14,620
The thing about tides
is they're never the same.

694
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:16,862
They ebb and they flow.
They're different every day.

695
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:18,620
The only thing
you can count on is

696
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,655
there is a low tide
and there is a high tide.

697
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:24,068
And if you draw that analogy
to <i>Survivor,</i>

698
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:26,862
the only thing
that matters every day is

699
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,275
you got to survive
the high tide of <i>Survivor.</i>

700
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,586
PROBST:
So let's get into it, Gabler.

701
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:34,758
What happened
when you get back to camp?

702
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:36,103
Because this was unexpected.

703
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:37,620
GABLER:
Oh, it was big. You know,

704
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:38,965
when there's seven people left,

705
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:40,310
it's always kind of
a magical time

706
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:41,793
in <i>Survivor</i> history.
Things happen.

707
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:44,793
The fact that you have one, two,
potentially three people

708
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:46,931
out of the seven
that are immune--

709
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:48,620
that was a lot of chaos
back at camp.

710
00:34:48,724 --> 00:34:50,620
PROBST:
And how does that work, Karla?

711
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:52,241
What are the rules
of this group when it comes

712
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:55,448
- to having a conversation?
- KARLA: We are so polite. Like,

713
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,137
"Would you like
to dance with me, sir?"

714
00:34:57,241 --> 00:34:58,862
"Sure." You know, and then,
"Let's dance now."

715
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:01,103
So you never know
where that tide

716
00:35:01,206 --> 00:35:03,793
is going and how high or low
it's going

717
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:06,000
'cause everyone's open
for business.

718
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:09,068
Owen, it's got to be terrifying
with no firm footing.

719
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:11,896
Talk about a tide.
You're just...

720
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,068
This is it, all day, every day
out here with you all.

721
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah. It's absolute madness,
and it's ironic,

722
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:18,103
'cause at the last Tribal,
I said,

723
00:35:18,206 --> 00:35:19,931
"I feel okay, Jeff.
I feel fine."

724
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,482
And then, of course, the plan

725
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,034
that I thought was
going to happen did not happen.

726
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:25,413
So, just seeing everyone

727
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:27,931
talk and turn
and twist and swap partners,

728
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:29,275
and it's-it's a lot going on.

729
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:30,482
PROBST:
Sami, what's going on?

730
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,379
You-you were gesturing
back there.

731
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:35,551
Yeah, man. It's really hard
'cause after the last vote,

732
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:36,896
I feel very so much
on the bottom.

733
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,931
And so it's hard because

734
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:41,206
you don't get second chances
this late into the game.

735
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,068
All I can do is put myself out
there as a free agent, right?

736
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:47,275
And everybody else is deciding
whether I am the guy who's

737
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:48,586
at the end of his career,
who you don't

738
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:49,896
really want
to give a chance anymore,

739
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,068
or the guy
who's at the end of the career

740
00:35:52,172 --> 00:35:53,655
who you give
the one-year contract

741
00:35:53,758 --> 00:35:55,724
because that guy can still
produce for you a little bit,

742
00:35:55,827 --> 00:35:56,896
and get you to the next vote.

743
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,344
Jesse,
that's a pretty good pitch

744
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,896
because that's Sami saying,

745
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,724
"Look, I can catch the ball

746
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,551
a couple more times
if you need me."

747
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:05,965
- That can be valuable at seven.
- Yeah, and I think

748
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,241
that's why you have to
constantly be open for business.

749
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:09,758
That's why
you have these conversations.

750
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:12,000
That's why you have to consider
everybody as, like,

751
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,517
you know,
a member of your team,

752
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,413
and a possible
useful member of your team.

753
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:17,413
PROBST:
Cassidy, the one thing
you can count on

754
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:19,448
with every other player is

755
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:21,344
what they are thinking about
is this:

756
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:22,689
how do I get to the end?

757
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:24,103
- Yeah.
- So when somebody comes

758
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:25,551
to approach you with an idea,

759
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:27,827
- it's to help them
get to the end.
- Yeah.

760
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:30,793
And the question is
will it help you get to the end?

761
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:33,551
Yeah. I mean, especially as
we're getting closer and closer

762
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:34,931
to this endgame, right,

763
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:37,068
and-and you have to analyze

764
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:39,689
every person, their strengths,
their weaknesses,

765
00:36:39,793 --> 00:36:42,896
their moves, you know,
their threat level in the game.

766
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,344
Do I feel like I could trust you
for a vote if I needed you?

767
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:47,413
You're trying to see into, like,
the crystal ball of the future

768
00:36:47,517 --> 00:36:49,034
when it's-it's really foggy
right now.

769
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:51,413
PROBST:
And, Sami, now you have

770
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:52,896
the ticking clock on idols,

771
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,172
if they're in the game,
other advantages.

772
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:57,310
Tonight's the last night
you can use Shot in the Dark.

773
00:36:57,413 --> 00:36:59,413
How much does that
ratchet up the tension?

774
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,896
It ratchets up a lot.
You know, advantages and idols--

775
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,793
you know, these've been the talk
of the town around the season,

776
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,413
but yet we still have yet
to see one played.

777
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:08,551
It becomes paramount
for you deciding,

778
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:10,551
do I want a souvenir
to take home or do

779
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:13,103
I want to play the game all the
way till I can play the game?

780
00:37:13,206 --> 00:37:14,862
You know what I mean?
Especially in terms of, like,

781
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:17,620
having an advantage or having
an idol, and so, I'm gonna

782
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:19,862
go up there, I'm gonna play
my Shot in the Dark tonight.

783
00:37:23,965 --> 00:37:25,620
You know, at the end of the day,

784
00:37:25,724 --> 00:37:27,413
if the people who said
they were with me today

785
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:29,655
are actually with me,
we should be fine.

786
00:37:29,758 --> 00:37:32,379
But if not,
we'll see what happens.

787
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:35,413
PROBST:
So, Karla, here's where
those conversations

788
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:37,172
where you asked each other
to dance come into play,

789
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:39,275
because what
I just heard him say was,

790
00:37:39,379 --> 00:37:40,655
"Don't count on my vote.

791
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,482
"And if everything
is as it's supposed to be,

792
00:37:42,586 --> 00:37:43,724
my vote won't matter anyway."

793
00:37:44,724 --> 00:37:46,931
KARLA: Yeah. Uh, well...

794
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:48,931
It's, um...

795
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,689
[sighs]

796
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:53,862
It... I don't know,
it's unfortunate, I think.

797
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:55,448
You know, I've never
heard someone just say,

798
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:57,000
"I'm gonna
play my Shot in the Dark."

799
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:58,310
C-Can you explain to me
how it's unfortunate, though?

800
00:37:58,413 --> 00:37:59,793
Like, what's unfortunate
about it?

801
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:01,931
The fact that, you know,

802
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:04,103
people have told you to trust,

803
00:38:04,206 --> 00:38:06,586
and then you're just saying,
"Well, screw my vote."

804
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,310
SAMI:
If what I was told today

805
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,344
is what's going on,
then it doesn't matter.

806
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:12,551
PROBST:
So, Gabler,
when you hear Sami say,

807
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:14,000
"I'm playing
my Shot in the Dark,"

808
00:38:14,103 --> 00:38:15,275
assuming he's telling the truth,

809
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:17,586
does it change anything
about your pulse

810
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:19,620
or is that just <i>Survivor?</i>

811
00:38:19,724 --> 00:38:21,965
No. I'm gonna
continue on with the way

812
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:24,689
I believe it's gonna be
when I came in here.

813
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:26,241
I'm sticking with the plan.

814
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:27,793
PROBST:
How about you, Jesse?

815
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:28,862
JESSE:
No, I think this
kind of gets back

816
00:38:28,965 --> 00:38:30,206
to something that we said, like,

817
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,137
last Tribal, where trust
is currency out here.

818
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:34,793
If you spend too much time
checking, like, if your trust,

819
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,862
like, the bill that somebody
gave you is counterfeit,

820
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,241
then you go back to camp,
and, you know,

821
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:41,103
nobody can trust you still.

822
00:38:41,206 --> 00:38:42,379
But you got to take risks
in this game.

823
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:43,655
You got to.

824
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:46,689
'Cause if I sit back idly
and get lied to

825
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:48,586
the way I lied to other people,

826
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:50,586
that's not the way
I want to go out.

827
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:54,482
All right, it is time to vote.

828
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:56,586

00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:48,896
Any votes cast against him
will not count.

836
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,931
Cody bet on... Owen.

838
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:58,413
- PROBST: Predicted it correctly.
- Wow.

839
00:39:58,517 --> 00:40:00,379
PROBST:
Any votes for Cody
will not count.

840
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:05,413
All right. If anybody
has an advantage or an idol

841
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:08,448
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

842
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:15,034
Owen and Karla weren't the only
ones in deep water today, Jeff.

843
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:17,034
- [laughter]
- I played the Shot in the Dark.

844
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:20,586
PROBST:
Want to bring it up?

845
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:22,241
Sure.

846
00:40:24,034 --> 00:40:25,448
Thank you.

847
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:31,620
All right, so Sami
played his Shot in the Dark,

848
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:33,517
which means there is
not a vote in here from him.

849
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,103
Sami, if this says you are safe,

850
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:37,586
any votes against you
will not count.

851
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:39,310
If it says "not safe,"
then any votes

852
00:40:39,413 --> 00:40:40,862
cast against you will count.

853
00:40:40,965 --> 00:40:42,620

Sami, you are...

...not safe.

857
00:40:51,758 --> 00:40:54,103
Any votes cast against you
will still count.

858
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,586
All right, I'll read the votes.

859
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:05,655
First vote, Sami.

860
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,413
Sami. Two votes Sami.

861
00:41:14,551 --> 00:41:16,896
Sami.
That's three votes Sami.

862
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:23,241
12th person voted out and the
fifth member of our jury, Sami.

863
00:41:23,344 --> 00:41:25,275
That's four. That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

You guys can

I'll be there.

Sami, the tribe has spoken.

Thank you, brother.

872
00:41:44,206 --> 00:41:45,413
Time for you to go.
