168
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,379
a hard right. 3:00 o'clock.

169
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,551
Or more like 2:30.
There we go.

170
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:09,551
- Owen doing a nice job
of communicating...
- Good job, bro.

171
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:11,827
- to Cody and Karla
- Yup. Now we're gonna brake.

172
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,689
as he goes upside down,

173
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:15,344
- left and right, sideways.
- Yeah.

174
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,344
Oh, my God. Got to go, uh, to
the right. To the right, guys.

175
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:20,137
- PROBST: Red is hung up.
- You guys both got
to get behind me!

176
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,034
Keep going...
No, no, wrong way, other way.

177
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:23,931
- Oh, this way.
- Got it?

178
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,413
Cassidy is now maneuvering
around that obstacle,

179
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:28,172
and they are through.

180
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:29,551
Pull it towards Cody.

181
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:31,655
- Over the sawdust?
- Yup. Uh, not quite.

182
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:33,137
You'll be there in, like,
four steps. Watch your feet.

183
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:36,862
PROBST:
Owen with a nice lead for Blue.

184
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:39,379
- Uh.
- There we go.
Now we're through the sawdust.

185
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:40,551
- To the right.
- To the right.

186
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:43,068
You got to get behind! Go!

187
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,172
Red once again struggling to
get through another passageway.

188
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:47,655
- Pull back?
- Pull back, pull back.

189
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,965
Now-now push forward
to your right, to your right.

190
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,206
Yes. Yeah. Yes, yes.

191
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,655
- PROBST:
Red is back on the move.
- CASSIDY: Keep going.

192
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:54,206
Here we go. Watch out, Cody.
Watch out, watch out.

193
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,000
- CODY: Are we at the-the base?
- We're at the gate.

194
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:58,379
Owen doing a nice job,
calm communicating.

195
00:07:58,482 --> 00:08:00,310
- Now push it?
- Now push me over.

196
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,206
Got to get him up on that
platform and then you're good.

197
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,758
So we got to rotate
180 degrees around. Clockwise.

198
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:07,827
Now Owen needs to be able
to see that maze so he can tell

199
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:10,379
Cody and Karla what to do.
Nice job by Blue.

200
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:13,310
- Okay.
- PROBST: Owen is straight up.

201
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:15,000
That's about as good
as it gets right there.

202
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,000
Down. You're at it.

203
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,931
PROBST:
This is the last part
of this challenge.

204
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:21,379
- Cody, pull up.
- PROBST: Get that white ball

205
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:23,068
from one corner to the other.

206
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:26,620
Up. Cody, up.
Karla, stay where you are. Okay.

207
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:29,655
Stay there. Yes. Now forward.
Forward. A little to the left.

208
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,827
- Stay where you. A little
to the left, now forward.
- Here comes Red

209
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:33,344
trying to stay in it.

210
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:35,620
Towards Karla, hard.

211
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,206
- Beautiful.
- PROBST: Owen has been calm

212
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,172
this entire challenge.

213
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,724
- One, two, three!
- Push up. Three.

214
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:42,551
- Push. Oh,
to the right a little.
- To the right.

215
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,931
PROBST:
Red is lined up.
They come straight in.

216
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:49,137
- Okay.
- Now Cassidy-- can she see
from here is the question?

217
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:50,517
- Are we in there?
- All right.
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

218
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,344
- All right, go, go, go!
- She's gonna do it

219
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,758
- sideways.
- GABLER: Where are you?
- To the right, to the right.

220
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,310
PROBST:
Now Jesse and Gabler got to get

221
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,931
to the maze
and find their spots.

222
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,413
- OWEN: Both down.
- PROBST: Blue has had
a lot of time now

223
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:01,965
- to try to figure this out.
- OWEN: Tell me...

224
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,068
I'll tell you when to go.

225
00:09:03,172 --> 00:09:04,655
Okay, we're going...

226
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,172
We're going up now.
We're fine.

227
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,931
- We're going a different way.
- There you go, Gabler!

228
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:10,241
PROBST:
Look at that.
Jesse and Gabler are here.

229
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:12,206
- Okay. Yes. Now go up. Up.
- PROBST: They're back in it.

230
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,275
- This challenge is on.
- Karla, down a bit.

231
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,448
All right, we're gonna make
a left turn

232
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,000
so we're gonna go down
and then...

233
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:20,241
PROBST: Big reward on the line.
A visit to the sanctuary.

234
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:21,482
Right, right,
right, right, right!

235
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:22,551
- Right?
- Right. No, up, up, up, up.

236
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:23,896
Up, up. Yeah, good.

237
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It is a scorching
hot day in Fiji.

238
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,344
- Okay, go to the left.
- CASSIDY: Left.

239
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:29,275
PROBST:
This will be a nice break

240
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,413
- from the routine of camp now.
- To the left. Down.

241
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,034
Up now, Cody. There we go.

242
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:35,000
PROBST:
Blue with another nice move.

243
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:37,827
They are closing in
on a victory right here.

244
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,586
Down. Down to the left. Yes.
Here we go. Now up.

245
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:43,551
Karla, start lifting up.
Gently, gently, gently.

246
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:46,655
- Gently. A little more.
- PROBST: Wow.
This is a nice touch

247
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,655
- if they can pull it off.
- A little more. And now.

248
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:50,758
- Up.
- PROBST: They can't.

249
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:53,586
And that opens the door
for Red now, who is gaining.

250
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,000
Down to the left, left, left!
There we go, there we go.

251
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:56,827
PROBST:
Red is not far behind

252
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,655
- Blue right now.
- OWEN: Lift, Cody.
Gently, gently.

253
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:00,551
- Up, Cody, up, Cody.
- Blue losing more ground.

254
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:02,689
Going backwards again.

255
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:05,241
The door is open and we are
at the same spot in the maze.

256
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:07,482
- Yes, yes. Here we go.
- Push. Go. Go, push.

257
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:08,965
Hell yes. Okay.
We're right there.

258
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,344
PROBST:
Blue has made it.

259
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:13,034
They're closer
than they have ever been.

260
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:15,482
Just got to get it to drop
for the win.

261
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:18,241
As soon as I say "up," you got
to go up, up, up, up, up, up!

262
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:21,206
- Red right there.
- Down, Cody.
Give it more juice.

263
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,862
- Hard, Karla. Hard, Karla.
No! Other way.
- PROBST: No!

264
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:27,000
They miss the opportunity.
Can Red catch them?

265
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:28,310
Up, up, up, up, up, up!

266
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:30,034
PROBST:
So close!

267
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:31,103
Pull towards you, Karla.

Yeah, no. Okay.

- Up, Cody. Up, Cody.

273
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:42,448

277
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:53,620
- OWEN: Great job y'all.
Oh, my God.
- Damn it.

278
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:56,689
- Elbows. Elbows.
- Oh, we were close.

279
00:10:56,793 --> 00:11:01,206
All right, Owen, Cody, Karla,

280
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,448
you're gonna leave here,
go directly to the sanctuary.

281
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,551
An array of pastries

fill your body
and lift your spirits.

283
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,827
Grab your stuff, head out.

284
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,896
- Boat'll pick you up.
- Thank you.
- See y'all.

285
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Enjoy the afternoon.
Well earned.

00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:46,448
But she's still in it.
Not the first time

492
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:49,068
Karla has suffered an injury
on a challenge.

493
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:51,482
You got
to attack this challenge.

494
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:53,413
You want to get to five.

495
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:56,379
Do not let somebody
take you out at six.

496
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,827
Cody's gonna get through first.

497
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,551
Owen right next to him.

498
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:05,103
There's Cassidy and Karla.
Gabler has his.

499
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:06,862
It's Jesse, the only person yet

500
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:10,172
to win an immunity challenge,
in dead last.

501
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:15,034
Cody gonna get
to his combination first.

502
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:18,000
Cassidy's out second.
There's Owen.

503
00:20:18,103 --> 00:20:20,137
There's Karla.
Here comes Gabler.

504
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:22,413
Everybody gonna be in on it.

505
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,586
Now you have three number tiles.

506
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,172
They are pairs of numbers.

507
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,827
Each pair represents one number.

508
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:30,793
You're trying
to figure out the order.

509
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,310
Once you think
you have it, try it.

510
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:35,103
If it doesn't work, try again.

511
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:42,172
Jesse goes from dead last
to first. Jesse solves his.

512
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,068
He's through.

513
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:48,103
There's Owen. He solves his.
Gabler has his.

514
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,413
Jesse up the cargo net.

515
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,137
Use that key to unlock
your puzzle pieces, Jesse.

516
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:55,689
- Oh!
- Owen has lost his key.

517
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:58,172
He's got to go back.

518
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:01,344
He forgot it. Cody has his.

519
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:05,586
Cassidy has hers.
Cassidy's through.

520
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,448
Here comes Cody.

521
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:10,793
Now, it's everybody but Karla.

522
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,758
Karla's still working
on her combination.

523
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:15,655
Cassidy is up.

524
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:19,551
Cody's up.
Owen is up.

525
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,482
Jesse gonna start working
on the puzzle.

526
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:24,344
Cassidy right behind.

527
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:27,103
Gabler's got his first two,
both in the paint.

528
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:29,793
Owen, there you go. You're good.
Cody getting in on it.

529
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:32,655
Everybody starts solving. Karla
has her combination solved.

530
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,275
Here she comes.

531
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:39,517
Five of the six players
on the puzzle right now.

532
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,034
That's what you want on day 23.

533
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:43,724
Karla working her way up
the cargo net,

534
00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:46,241
and she is still smiling.

535
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:49,620
That is what you want
from a <i>Survivor</i> player.

536
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:52,862
You're making a bat puzzle.

537
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:56,206
Just think about your puzzle
and how you're building it.

538
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,689
<i>Survivor</i> puzzles always look
so simple when they're finished,

539
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:02,620
but assembling them
is another thing entirely.

540
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,241
Our puzzle designers
know what they're doing.

541
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:08,413
They know how
to make puzzles complicated

542
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:11,137
even though they look simple.

543
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:12,724
There are probably lots of ways
you can build this puzzle

544
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,655
that's not right.

545
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:17,172
It is Cassidy in the lead
with Karla

546
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:21,482
and Jesse right on her tail
on one side while Cody,

547
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:23,862
Owen and Gabler trying
to catch up on the other.

548
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:25,724
Damn.

549
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:28,172
PROBST:
Cassidy with a bit
of a lead still,

550
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:31,103
but Karla has caught up.
She was last

551
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:34,275
to get to the puzzle,
but that's why we have puzzles.

552
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,517
- You know what's wild, Jeff?
- What?

553
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,793
Is that, like, your hands get--
at least my hands,

554
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:40,413
because of the nerves--

555
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:42,034
they're all shot, you know?

556
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:44,793
Like, it's just kind of,
like, they're so numb,

557
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,827
and it's, like,
kind of scary, so...

558
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,965
Karla's had hand issues
this whole game.

559
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,206
For real.

560
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,379
PROBST:
Cody figured it out.
Cody's now in it.

561
00:22:54,482 --> 00:22:56,482
Cassidy down
to a few pieces left.

562
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:58,793
Karla down to a few pieces left.

563
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:00,448
They're side by side
fighting for immunity.

564
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:04,551
That is the race right now.
Cody's in it, as well.

565
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:06,620
Wow. Look-look at them.
They're cramping.

566
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:07,931
Hang in there, Karla.

567
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:10,172
- Dude!
- PROBST:
Karla really struggling.

568
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:12,344
Aah! I just twisted
my ankle so bad.

569
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,379
Her entire body
is shutting down,

570
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:16,310
and Cody is seizing
the opportunity.

571
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:19,344
We got a challenge. Karla,
you're gonna have to dig.

572
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:21,965
It is now Cassidy and Cody,

573
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,827
with Karla still in it
but faltering physically.

574
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:28,310
- [Karla groaning]
- Hang in there, Karla.

575
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:32,206
- Thank you. Aah!
- Cassidy down
to three pieces left.

576
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,000
Cody down to five pieces left.

577
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:39,310
Cassidy down to two pieces.

578
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:41,758
It is Cassidy and Cody.

579
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:43,689
Karla is falling out.

580
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:45,655
Cassidy with another piece.

581
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,206
Can Cody catch her on the end?

582
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,827
He's racing.

583
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:50,310
Cassidy with her last piece.

584
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,931
- Got it.
- Cassidy thinks she has it.

585
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,206
Cassidy is wrong.

586
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,275
- Oh.
- This challenge is still on.

587
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:59,620
Something is not right.
Cody's still digging.

588
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:03,620
Karla now getting back in there.
Karla down to two pieces.

589
00:24:03,724 --> 00:24:06,586
Cassidy now trying
to fix her puzzle.

590
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:09,000
Can Cody seize this opportunity?

591
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:10,827
This is coming down
to the last two pieces.

592
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:12,172
Cody down to a few pieces.

593
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:13,793
I'm done! I'm done! Jeff! Jeff!

594
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:15,758
PROBST:
Cassidy thinks she has it.

595
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:17,379
And this time Cassidy is right.

596
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:19,965
Individual immunity for Cassidy.

597
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:24,517
Guaranteed a spot
in the final five.

598
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,034
Wow. What a challenge.

599
00:24:27,137 --> 00:24:29,241
Cody got his puzzle

600
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:32,482
just a couple
of seconds too late.

601
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:36,586
- That was a close finish.
- [Karla panting]

602
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:37,965
Huge effort by everybody.

603
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,000
- OWEN: Good job, Cass.
- CODY: Good job, Cass.

604
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,310
- Ugh! [crying]
- PROBST: Cassidy, come over.

605
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:45,689
- Congratulations.
- [applause]

606
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:48,103
- CODY: Good job, Cass.
- Biggest win of the season

607
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:49,827
so far, day 23.

608
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:51,793
- Thank you so much.
- You get to wear this again.

609
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:53,655
Well earned.

610
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,275
- Thank you.
- You are safe.

611
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,551
- You are guaranteed a spot
in the final five.
- Yeah.

612
00:24:57,655 --> 00:24:59,379
As for the rest of you,

613
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:02,551
after 23 days,
one of you will be voted out.

614
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:04,241
- That will not be you.
You are safe. Congrats.
- Thank you.

615
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:05,655
- Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.
- OWEN: Good job, Cass.

616
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:06,862
- See you tonight at Tribal.
- Thank you so much.

617
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:08,172
Well done, Cassidy.

618
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:09,620
- CASSIDY: Thank you.
- You need help?

619

<i>KARLA: This immunity was
a tough one to lose</i>

GABLER: <i>Ay, caramba.</i>

627
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:42,172
- But I mean, it is...
- Two idols at play.

628
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:44,172
- Two idols.
- And then
we didn't get immunity.

629
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:46,137
There's six people, so there's
three people that we might

630
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:49,206
- Yeah.
- be able to shoot at.
If Cody and Karla were open,

631
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,862
- No, absolutely.
- that's a different story.

00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:52,275
If they both play idols,

633
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:54,413
it could be me or you

So you're saying there's

644
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:15,241
I have an idol.

- Okay.

646

to the final four with me?
- I do.

00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:23,413
- Okay?
- Yes.

649
00:26:24,758 --> 00:26:26,310
I'm gonna tell Cass
I'm playing my idol.

650

And then you, like,
just tell them,

651

"Like, hey,
I'm playing my idol." But...

00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,379
and, uh, then we keep our idols

662
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:57,655
and go to the five
with our idols

663
00:26:57,758 --> 00:26:58,931
<i>and guarantee our spots
in the four.</i>

664
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,379
<i>And so now Cody, Jesse, and I</i>

665
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:03,103
ultimately can decide
who goes home--

666
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,482
<i>Gabler or Owen.</i>

667
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:06,517
So I have an idol, um, and, uh,

668
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,344
- Cody's playing his
and I'm playing mine.
- Okay.

669
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:11,827
You know, if you want to stay,
like, would you vote Owen?

670
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,931
- I would.
- 100%. To stay in the game?

671
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:21,551
<i>When you put people at risk,
it's fascinating to see</i>

672
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:24,206
how quickly people will turn
on their own alliance.

673
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,344
- If push comes to shove...
- You'd be willing to...

674
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:28,620
I'm willing
to write Gabler's name down.

675
00:27:28,724 --> 00:27:31,275
Homeboy's gonna play it,
I'm gonna play it.

676
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,620
<i>It's a scare tactic,
and it's...</i>

677
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:39,103
it's foolproof, too,
though, right? Like, if

678
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:41,448
<i>we get a bad vibe,
we could still use our idols.</i>

679
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:43,448
<i>I'll use my idol,
Cody would use his idol.</i>

680
00:27:43,551 --> 00:27:44,793
<i>You know,
and we'll just duke it out</i>

681
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,275
<i>at the five
without idols, right?</i>

682
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:47,689
<i>But as long</i>

683
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:49,586
as this works out,
you'll see me at the final four.

684
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,344
Okay. Okay.

685
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:58,758
OWEN: We're playing 'em.

686
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,586
She's gonna buy it.
And wham, we knock her

687
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:07,620
right out of this game.
Won't see it coming.

688
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:09,379
- Is-is...
- Love that, bro. Okay.

689
00:28:09,482 --> 00:28:11,482
So we just... Uh, yeah, we just
can't let her get the drift

690
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,034
that us four guys are together.

691
00:28:13,137 --> 00:28:14,517
I'm stretching the truth
to Kar...

692
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,862
You know what?
The hell with it.

693
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:17,793
I'm lying to Karla.
I am lying to her

694
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,758
<i>so she doesn't
play her idol tonight</i>

695
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:22,172
<i>so that way I can blindside
the hell out of her.</i>

696
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:23,862
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:25,172
<i>CODY:
"Genius" is the word
for this plan.</i>

698
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:27,034
<i>I've been out here for 23 days.</i>

699
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:29,793
I'm a quick learner, and I've
learned very fast like a sponge.

700
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:31,620
And I'm out here as, you know,

701
00:28:31,724 --> 00:28:33,586
Wild Thing, Killer Cody,
Cowboy Cody.

702
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:35,034
Call me whatever you want,

703
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:36,551
but the switch
has definitely turned.

704
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:38,689
And, um...

705
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:41,068
yeah, sometimes
I surprise even myself.

706
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:45,862
Karla.

707
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:47,448
The four amigos of Owen,

708
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,896
<i>Gabler, Cody and Jesse
are all gonna vote Karla.</i>

709
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,862
<i>And she's gonna leave Tribal
with a walking stick</i>

710
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:54,724
<i>that I made her and an idol.</i>

711
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:00,310
<i>Jesse is on board.</i>

712
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:01,620
<i>I love that guy.
He's my roll dog.</i>

713
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:03,103
<i>Our trust</i>

714
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:06,137

has gotten so, like, forged,

715
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,620
it's unbelievable.

716
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:12,379
Yeah.

717
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:14,172
<i>JESSE:
You know, Cody's plan
is great for him,</i>

718
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:16,793
<i>but taking out Karla,
the biggest threat in the game,</i>

719
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:19,068
<i>would absolutely
boost his résumé.</i>

720
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:24,310
<i>We're at six now, and, like,</i>

721
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:26,413
<i>I can't be seen
as Cody's number two.</i>

722
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,758
And they just see
that I've sort of,

723
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,068
like, made the same moves
as Cody,

724
00:29:29,172 --> 00:29:31,103
<i>who's a little bit louder.</i>

725
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:33,482
<i>It might be time
to just be openly cutthroat,</i>

726
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:35,620
<i>but then, at the same time,
I don't know.</i>

727
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:37,862
<i>There's a lot to think about.
Like, I-I love Cody,</i>

728
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:40,068
<i>and I think he would
take me to the end, but, like,</i>

729
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:42,241
<i>I have to wonder
if I can beat him.</i>

730
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:44,448
<i>I got two kids at home,
I got a wife.</i>

731
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:46,000
<i>And, like,</i>

732
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:47,448
people are out here
and they're saying, like,

733
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:49,724
"This is, like, so much fun,
right? Like, this..."

734
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:53,379
"No matter what, like,
oh, we've already won."

735
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:55,758
<i>You know, they want the million,
but, like, they seem like,</i>

736
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:58,000
<i>"Oh, this is all
about the experience."</i>

737
00:29:58,103 --> 00:30:01,068
<i>For me, like, no, the experience
is great, but, like,</i>

738
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:04,724
for me, like, I need to secure
my family's future and, like...

739
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:10,275
And I'll do anything to do that.
You know, I'll do anything.

740
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,965
So... [sniffles]

741
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:16,965
If I got to switch it up
and be more brutal, I will.

742
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:22,413
Yeah, it is.

743
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:28,655
Oh. Oh.

744
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:32,827
Yeah.

745
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,137
She's gonna play hers.

746
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:37,172
And we'll flush...

747
00:30:39,586 --> 00:30:42,000

- That's... completely great.

748

he has it, like, locked in.

750
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:48,206
Like, he doesn't
have it locked in.

751
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,965
Got him right
where we want 'em, Jesse.

752
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:55,862
- I can't believe that.
- I... I know.

753
00:30:55,965 --> 00:30:57,379
I know.
Don't know how it went...

754
00:30:58,379 --> 00:30:59,620

<i>CASSIDY:

00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,379

We don't know for sure

758
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:06,137

- Okay.

00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:20,310

you were close to having
a real shot at winning,

just seized up.

00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:24,379
two of them are also safe--
uh, Karla and Cody-- so...

827
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:25,689
PROBST:
Why are they also safe?

828
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:27,517
Uh, they've sort of,

829
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,896
kind of made it known

830
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,413
that they're gonna be
playing their idols tonight.

831
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:34,137
Karla, what was
the rationale to say, A,

832
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:37,413
"I have an idol," and B,
"I am playing it tonight"?

833
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:41,620
Yeah. Um, I feel like rumors
of me having an idol--

834
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:43,206
well, clearly, they're true--

835
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,862
have been making me a target,
and this is the only way

836
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:47,620
I can guarantee
my safety tonight.

837
00:34:47,724 --> 00:34:49,620
Cody, what was
the rationale for you?

838
00:34:49,724 --> 00:34:51,103
Was it simply fear that
"I didn't win

839
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:52,724
and I think I'm a target"?

840
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:55,310
Yeah. I'm gonna give myself a
shot to live to see another day.

841
00:34:55,413 --> 00:34:58,655
Um, you know, it's either today
or tomorrow that I play it.

842
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:02,241
So, it's a pretty easy decision
for me, and, uh, I...

843
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:05,206
I don't see any reason
that I wouldn't go that route.

844
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:09,482
PROBST: So, Owen, what do you
do when you take all this in

845
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:13,620
at camp and you think it's
either you, Jesse or Gabler?

846
00:35:13,724 --> 00:35:15,758
You have to go
and make your pitch,

847
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:17,827
and you just hope
something sticks.

848
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:21,103
But it's really crappy knowing
that someone with a necklace,

849
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:24,172
two people with idols, it could
just take one vote to send one

850
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:25,793
of the three of us home,
and, you know,

851
00:35:25,896 --> 00:35:28,344
that's a different pill to
swallow than getting voted out,

852
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:30,379
you know, seven to two
or something like that.

853
00:35:30,482 --> 00:35:31,827
Like, it's tough.

854
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:33,827
Jesse, it's also
a bit of gambling.

855
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:37,068
If they have idols and
those idols are good until five,

856
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:39,655
they could wait, so
this could be a bluff, as well.

857
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:42,724
JESSE:
Yeah, I mean, it could be,
but I don't feel like

858
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:45,448
I'm in a position to sort of
call their bluff at this point.

859
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:47,965
Like, you know, we talk
about the social contract

860
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:50,068
that's been in place, and, like,
you have to really be like,

861
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:51,655
"All right, you know, like, tell
me which dance moves to make,

862
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:54,551
and I'll make them and, like,
we'll just go along." So...

863
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:57,931
PROBST:
Cody, that's a big move
if that's what you are doing.

864
00:35:58,034 --> 00:35:59,827
Two people saying,
"We're the royalty,

865
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:01,689
"and we're gonna tell you
what the rules are.

866
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,689
"We're not going home,
and it's one of you three,

867
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:05,965
and we're gonna decide."
Is that how you looked at it?

868
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,793
Absolutely. I mean,
I'd be lying if I said

869
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:10,310
I didn't talk to Karla
about it. You know,

870
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:12,275
"Hey, who are we looking at?"

871
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,689
And, um, it could just be one

872
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:17,551
that decides the fate
of someone tonight. And, um...

873
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:20,413
as tragic as it sounds,
it's not me.

874
00:36:20,517 --> 00:36:22,068
PROBST:
Karla, Cody was just

875
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:23,448
- really honest.
- KARLA: Mm-hmm.

876
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,620
He said it's tragic,
but it won't be for me.

877
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:27,413
- KARLA: Mm-hmm.
- Do you feel similar?

878
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:28,965
KARLA:
Yeah. I mean,

879
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:31,137
luckily I do have something
to protect me tonight.

880
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:35,586
So it is unfortunate, but I feel
confident and I hope that

881
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:37,827
folks that I spoke to today
feel confident.

882
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:39,931
How about you, Gabler?
How confident are you

883
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:42,275
that what you were told
is gonna happen tonight?

884
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:44,827
I-I think I'm pretty confident.

885
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:46,172
I think I'm gonna see tomorrow.

886
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:48,034
You know, 12 hours difference

887
00:36:48,137 --> 00:36:49,413
in <i>Survivor</i> is a world
of difference.

888
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:50,793
And, you know, this afternoon

889
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:52,275
it was an apex predator buffet

890
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:54,655
and we were just kind of
serving up whatever they were

891
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:57,655
needing just to see if
we could sail to tomorrow.

892
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,241
Jesse, you were
nodding in agreement.

893
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,275
Yeah. You know, I'm not
trying to make too many

894
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:03,310
big moves, right? Like, I'm
just like, "You fill me in,

895
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:04,517
let me know what's going on."

896
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,000
And as vulnerable
as I felt today,

897
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:09,103
I hope that I landed
on the right move.

898
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:10,448
PROBST:
How about you, Owen?

899
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:12,827
You know, I was peddling
the book of Sandra today.

900
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,379
You know, anybody but me.

901
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,137
You know, I've been
in tough spots before

902
00:37:16,241 --> 00:37:18,620
in this game and I'm not
gonna count myself out.

903
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:22,275
But I'd be lying if I said
I felt super-duper confident

904
00:37:22,379 --> 00:37:24,172
in my chances, but

905
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,931
I'm not counting myself out
just quite yet.

906
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:29,034
Cody, how confident are you
that the vote is gonna go

907
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:30,034

908
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:32,379
Uh, I'll give it a niner.

909
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:34,551
I'm pretty confident.
I think, um,

910
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,965
you know, I'm the person that
people were wanting to talk to

911
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:40,275
and, um, they were giving me
the best pitch and, um,

00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:44,344
uh, yeah, nine and a half,
actually, is where I'm at.

913
00:37:44,448 --> 00:37:46,413
- Pretty good.
- Yeah. Pretty good. Yeah.

914
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,448

I'm at on this. 95%.
