1
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,103
Honestly, I appreciate
every single one of you.

2
00:00:20,206 --> 00:00:21,448
I know she meant a lot to--

3
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:22,931
I mean, she meant
a lot to all of us.

4
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:24,965
- We believe in you. So...
- Thank you.

5
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:27,379
I love you guys.

6
00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:29,448
- Let's do it.
- Love you guys.

7
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,413
<i>Nneka and I had a very good
alliance, and I voted for her.</i>

8
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:35,517
<i>So coming back from Tribal</i>

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,379
was like
my girlfriend dumped me,

10
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,965
and the pizza guy that I ordered
pizza from didn't show up,

11
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:42,965
and my roommate drank
all the beer in the fridge.

12
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:44,137
<i>It was just brutal.</i>

13
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:52,620
<i>We have no flint,
no food, no fire,</i>

14
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:54,793
<i>and we've lost
two challenges in a row.</i>

15
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:58,517
<i>We are in dead last,
and it is crunch time.</i>

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,793
<i>We need to kick some butt
and, uh, get back on track.</i>

17
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,241
Come on, guys. This is <i>Survivor.</i>

18
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,862
Like, this is showtime.
Let's go.

19
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:33,275
I don't know.

20
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,655
I don't want it.

21
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:46,827
Oh. Thanks, dude.

22
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:49,931
<i>This is Gabler.</i>

23
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:53,241
This is Mike Gabler personified,

24
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:55,172
out here on <i>Survivor.</i>

25
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:58,103
<i>I love the guy,
and at this point,</i>

26
00:01:58,206 --> 00:01:59,724
<i>we're working together, collaborating,</i>

27
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:03,000
but sometimes he's not aware.

28
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:06,275
Oh, yeah, such a nice blanket.

29
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,344
<i></i>
Survivor <i>is more than a game.</i>

30
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:10,206
<i>You're living with these people,</i>

31
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,517
so it becomes really tricky when
you get under each other's skin

32
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,000
a little bit
or you touch nerves.

33
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:16,620
Was the palm frond
at all helpful?

34
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:19,172
No. You woke me up.

35
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,413
- I was asleep.
- Oh, sorry.

36
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,827
<i>We don't want to have to
walk on eggshells</i>

37
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:24,724
<i>all the time, but we can't</i>

38
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:25,896
be shocked when all of a sudden

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,758
we crack somebody's egg.

40
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:30,724
- Do you need little sticks?
That's gonna...
- We need a few more.

41
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:32,448
Put some more burl up in there,
it'll catch. Yeah.

42
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,931
<i>Gabler's starting
to rub me the wrong way.</i>

43
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:37,758
He's becoming a detriment
to potentially our game,

44
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:39,482
but honestly,
to our camp life as well.

45
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:42,448
These are way too big
to catch just off of that.

46
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:44,448
- Two seconds will burn that.
- Oh, yeah, for sure.

47
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:46,137
Well, the problem is
all the fire's blowing this way.

48
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:47,724
It's not coming up.

49
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:49,689
What does that have to do
with the size of the sticks?

50
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:51,379
There's some
small sticks in there.

51
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:53,689
- All right.
No, it totally worked.
- But we need more. More.

52
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:56,241
- Hey, Elie. Okay, I know.
- I'm sorry, I'm frustrated...

53
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,000
- Well, you're not helping.
- And your way didn't work,

54
00:02:58,103 --> 00:02:59,827
and so maybe
we try little sticks.

55
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,758
Okay. Then go get more.

56
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:04,965
- You do it. That's right.
Just go ahead and do it.
- I am literally doing it.

57
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,241
<i>Elie's a very
strong personality.</i>

58
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:09,103
I'm a very strong personality.

59
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,551
<i>The two of us clash.</i>

60
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:13,379
<i>On top of that,
I don't trust her at all,</i>

61
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:17,275
<i>because she already rummaged
through my bag to read my idol.</i>

62
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:20,724
If we get too far with her,
we will all regret it.

63
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,379
Come on in.

64
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:35,862
Howdy, Jeff.

65
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,862
Well, good morning, Coco.

66
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:39,448
Jeff.

67
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,896
Let me just quickly
take attendance.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,068
Okay, there's Lindsay.
Cassidy's here. Geo.

69
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:50,827
- Good morning, Baka.
- Good morning.
- How are you, Jeff?

70
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:56,275
Coco and Baka,
getting your first look

71
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:58,103
at the new Vesi tribe.

72
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:01,689
Nneka voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

73
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:05,517
All right, shall we get
to today's reward challenge?

74
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,310
Yeah!

75
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,310
For today's challenge,
one player from each tribe

76
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:15,034
<i>is gonna use sandbags
to knock blocks off a ledge.</i>

77
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:21,068
<i>That same player will then
walk on two of the blocks</i>

78
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:23,275
<i>to get to the finish,</i>

79
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:26,379
<i>where the three remaining
tribe members must each land</i>

80
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:29,517
<i>one sandbag
on one of the hanging discs.</i>

81
00:04:30,758 --> 00:04:32,517
First tribe to finish
wins reward.

82
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,517
- Want to know
what you're playing for?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,862
Today, it's a winner take all.

84
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:39,517
First tribe to finish
will have ten fresh fish

85
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,068
- delivered to your camp.
- Sweet.

86
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,413
In addition, the winning tribe
earns the right

87
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:48,896
to go to one of
the other two tribe camps

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,103
and steal one item.

89
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:55,068
Oh, yeah.

90
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:56,655
Oh.

91
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:58,551
All right, Coco,
you have two extra members.

92
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:00,275
Sitting two people out.

93
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:01,793
- I'm out, Jeff.
- James is out.

94
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:04,551
Lindsay's out.
Baka, you have one extra person.

95
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:06,448
- I can sit out.
- Elie's
gonna sit out for Baka.

96
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:08,586
Everybody else,
give you a minute to strategize.

97
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:09,862
We'll get started.
Here we go.

98
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:11,758
Sit-outs, you're
heading over to the bench.

99
00:05:16,586 --> 00:05:18,000
All right, here we go.

100
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:20,517
For reward.
Survivors ready?

101
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:25,103
- Go!
- Come on, Ryan.

102
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:26,586
Ryan.

103
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:30,137
It is Ryan, Sami and Cody.

104
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:33,000
You got to
knock all the blocks off.

105
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:36,310
That's the first phase.
Nice hit by Sami.

106
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:38,068
- Aah!
- Come on, come on, come on.

107
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,172
Go ahead.

108
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:42,448
Cody firing his sandbag.

109
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,206
Yeah. Yeah! Yeah!

110
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,965
Wow! Cody takes
half his stack off

111
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:49,310
- with one toss.
- Yeah! Let's go!

112
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:52,103
Vesi somehow now
with some fire in them.

113
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:54,793
- Let's go!
- After two back-to-back
immunity losses,

114
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,655
Cody is blistering
this course right now.

115
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:01,413
- Yeah!
- Looking like an MLB pitcher.

116
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,448
- There you go.
- Ryan with another toss.

117
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:04,931
Here goes Sami.

118
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:06,241
They're about to fall off.

119
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:08,068
- Yeah! One more!
- Sami on fire.

120
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:10,206
Cody, you're good.
Come forward.

121
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,620
Vesi in the lead.

122
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:14,000
They have not been
in this position very often.

123
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:16,793
Now, you can only use your feet,

124
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:19,172
and you got to move across
this hot lava.

125
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,896
That's it. All right.
You got a feel for it.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,137
- Got to start again.
- You got a feel for it...

127
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:26,482
- Yes!
- Sami knocks his last block off.

128
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,551
Pick your two. Pick your two. Mediums.

129
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,689
It is now Cody and Sami.

130
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:34,103
You can only use your feet.

131
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:37,827
Cody really going for it.
Extending those blocks. Far out.

132
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,206
Go, Ryan! You got this!

133
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,551
Ryan with two more blocks.
Let's go, Coco!

134
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:44,310
- Cody is halfway there.
- Great job.

135
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:47,310
Sami right on his tail.

136
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:50,310
Nice job by Cody
getting past that log.

137
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:51,965
Yes! Let's go, Cody!

138
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,103
Very surprising
to see red ahead of anyone.

139
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,793
Could this be
a turning point for Vesi?

140
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,413
I'm gonna take my time.

141
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:03,000
- You're good.
- Great job. Take your time.

142
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:05,172
Cody very close to the finish.

143
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:06,517
You're good. Let's go!

144
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,137
Vesi through the first phase,
in the lead.

145
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,620
Let's go, guys. Let's go.
Let's go.

146
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:11,551
Sami trying
to keep Baka in this,

147
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:14,379
and Ryan
in dead last for Coco.

148
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,931
Slowly inching
that last block off.

149
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,482
And it drops.
Coco, you're good.

150
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:21,793
Go, Coco!

151
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:25,896
Jesse sticks it for Vesi.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Vesi has their first.

153
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,000
Sami's across.

154
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:31,827
Ryan working on those blocks.

155
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:34,103
- This is
a winner-take-all challenge.
- Let's go, Ryan.

156
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:35,275
Let's go!

157
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:37,793
Yeah!

158
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:40,344
Noelle does it. Wow.
Vesi is on fire.

159
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:42,758
Dwight for the win...
On and off.

160
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,275
Baka trying to get in it.

161
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,965
- Jeanine just misses.
- All right, you got it.

162
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,413
Dwight on and off.

163
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:51,482
These get
increasingly more difficult

164
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,137
because they get smaller.

165
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:55,448
So your target is tiny now
for Dwight.

166
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,344
Let's go!

167
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:58,344
Ryan has his two blocks.

168
00:07:58,448 --> 00:07:59,862
You're good, Coco.

169
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:02,000
- Let's go!
- Coco is now gonna be in it.

170
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,137
Come on.

171
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:06,827
Oh. On and off for Dwight.

172
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,551
Geo comes in for Coco.
He has the first.

173
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:13,172
Coco's now in it.

174
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:16,655
Jeanine, she sticks it.

175
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:19,586
Baka with one,
Coco with one, Vesi with two.

176
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:20,931
All right, good job.

177
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,275
Dwight now feeling the pressure

178
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,965
of trying to win it right here.

179
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,448
And he does it!

180
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:30,103
Vesi wins reward!

181
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,689
Ten fish

182
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:34,896
and the opportunity
to steal one item

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,758
- from another tribe's camp.
- Yes! Yes!

184
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:40,586
Wow.

185
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:44,103
All right, Vesi.

186
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,758
You look
like a different tribe today.

187
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,448
Did you feel that, Noelle?

188
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:50,172
Absolutely, Jeff. You know,

189
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:52,413
we woke up this morning,
we were like, "Guns blazing.

190
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:54,655
We're tired of losing.
We want to eat."

191
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:57,413
We literally haven't eaten
anything other than coconut.

192
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:00,275
That's gonna change.
Ten fresh fish

193
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,379
delivered to your camp.

194
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:04,448
In addition,
you have earned the right

195
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:07,172
to go to either Baka or Coco

196
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,551
and take
any reward they've won--

197
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,068
their fishing gear
or their tool kit.

198
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:15,241
You could also take a pot.
You could take their machete.

199
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,551
The only thing off-limits
is a flint.

200
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:19,689
The question is, which tribe
are you gonna visit?

201
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,482
And what are you gonna take?

202
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:23,827
And we're gonna leave that
as a surprise for them.

203
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,103
Coco, Baka,
got nothing for you.

204
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:27,413
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

205
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:36,103
Go long.

206
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:39,724
All right, Vesi, what goes
through your mind on day eight?

207
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:41,689
You haven't had flint
in a long time.

208
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:43,344
You can't take their flint.

209
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,379
Do you have fire at your camp?

210
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:47,689
We do not, so, you know,
we're thinking,

211
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:49,724
you know, we're getting
all these ten beautiful fishes,

212
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:51,344
but how are we gonna eat 'em?

213
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:53,275
Are we allowed to trade reward?

214
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,620
Absolutely. You can always trade

215
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,413
- for a previous reward
and give up your fish.
- Yeah.

216
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:01,413
You still keep the camp raid.
That is a separate part.

217
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,413
- I think we should
do the tool kit...
- We could eat the fish raw.

218
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:05,413
I'm not eating ... fish raw, Cody.

219
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,172
- You don't eat sushi?
- No.

220
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,482
So lay it out, Noelle.
What are you gonna do?

221
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:12,551
So we are going
to trade our reward

222
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:15,137
and get the basket of fruit
and the tool kit.

223
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,172
All right. You'll have
the afternoon to figure out

224
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,931
which tribe you're visiting

225
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,517
and which tribe member
is going to make the visit--

226
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,241
- another big decision.
- Yeah.

227
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:24,965
All right, Vesi,
grab your stuff, head out.

228
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:26,448
Enjoy your afternoon. Congratulations.

229
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:27,965
Thanks, Jeff.

230
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:29,724
- Nice job, you guys. Yes.
- Gotta feel good to win.

231
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,862
<i>We dominated the crap
out of that challenge.</i>

232
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,137
<i>Winning the camp raid,
I mean, it is huge.</i>

233
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:36,103
<i>We have all the power
in our hands.</i>

234
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:37,379
<i>You don't want
to piss too many people off,</i>

235
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:38,931
<i>but then I have to think,</i>

236
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:40,034
you know, I'm playing
the game of <i>Survivor.</i>

237
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:41,724
It's a cutthroat freaking game.

238
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,103
<i>We did it.</i>

239
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:54,793
Oh.

240
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,413
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna start crying.

241
00:10:57,517 --> 00:10:59,172
This is the best feeling
in this world.

242
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,758
That was so fun.
That was so fun.

243
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,241
<i>We've been
on a bit of a losing streak,</i>

244
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:05,931
so it's extremely important
to turn things around.

245
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:09,103
And even though we won today,
there's no guarantees tomorrow.

246
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:11,413
<i>And so, like, we win
this camp raid, and, like,</i>

247
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,310
<i>we do have to think about what's
gonna strengthen us the most</i>

248
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:15,206
and what's gonna
weaken the other tribe.

249
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,000
Does anybody want to go?

250
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:19,206
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

251
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:24,724
As far as, you know, making sure
they're not pissed off.

252
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,448
Yeah.

253
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,068
<i>Cody's
an extremely likable guy.</i>

254
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,413
He's probably gonna go over
there and make them all laugh,

255
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,827
but at the same time,
this is a strategic game.

256
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:34,310
Yeah, I'm not
going in there, like,

257
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:36,862
stomping out their fire
and kicking over their fort.

258
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,482
"Aah!"

259
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:41,448
- Oh, God. <i>
- Sending Cody is truly</i>

260
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,000
just a wild card move.

261
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,827
We don't know what he's
gonna do, what he's gonna say.

262
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:46,896
<i>That's very scary.</i>

263
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,793
All right,
who are we going after?

264
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:52,103
What if we go to the yellow
tribe and take the fishing line,

265
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,517
two spearguns, two goggles.

266
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,827
Like, a full fishing set.

267
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,310
If we're trying
to strengthen our tribe,

268
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,172
that's gonna strengthen
our tribe the most.

269
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:01,620
<i>Honestly, I think they'd
be stupid to not come here.</i>

270
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:03,241
We have the most stuff.

271
00:12:03,344 --> 00:12:06,137
- Yeah.
- But they got
to look at the numbers, too.

272
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:10,103
Coco's strong. They're-they're
still their original six.

273
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,551
<i>I think they're
smart enough to go for Baka.</i>

274
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:13,965
<i>I really hope they are.</i>

275
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,965
Baka has bigger fishing gear,
bigger tool kit.

276
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:19,000
So I don't think we have
to worry about it anyway...

277
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:20,931
<i>I don't think
Vesi's gonna come after Coco</i>

278
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,275
because right now
they're hurting.

279
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,068
<i>They haven't been eating.</i>

280
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:27,482
<i>And Baka has the big
fishing gear-- bigger than ours.</i>

281
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:29,034
<i>But at the same time,</i>

282
00:12:29,137 --> 00:12:30,482
this is
a very scary moment for us,

283
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:31,896
because it's the first time
that we lose,

284
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,137
<i>actually.
We've never lost before.</i>

285
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,620
<i>If we're gonna piss off anybody,</i>

286
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:36,896
<i>I feel like we should
just piss off Coco.</i>

287
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,896
Because they have six people.

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,206
It's five and six,

289
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,827
so it's not like
they have a huge advantage.

290
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:42,379
If we go to Coco, would you
want to take the fishing gear?

291
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:43,724
- Machete would be...
- Fishing gear.

292
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:45,172
I mean, can you imagine
without a machete?

293
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:46,862
- Fishing gear.
- You can't cut c-coconuts.

294
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,896
- You can't start a fire.
- I know,
but if we win tomorrow,

295
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,586
we get our flint back,
we go fishing. That's fuel.

296
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:55,482
If this was old Jesse,
growing up as a teenager,

297
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:58,172
like, in L.A., you know,
tattoo on my face,

298
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:59,793
<i>I'd probably
go for the jugular,</i>

299
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,275
<i>be with Cody
and take the machete.</i>

300
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,137
- Show no mercy.
- Listen...

301
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,620
But I live on a cul-de-sac now.

302
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:06,137
I, you know, I got to be
diplomatic with my neighbors.

303
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:08,758
<i>And so, myself,
Noelle and Dwight are</i>

304
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:10,413
<i>against hitting the other tribes</i>

305
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:11,827
as hard as possible.

306
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,241
And I don't think
anybody would do that to us.

307
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,551
You know?

308
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:19,103
Can we start the flint
with the saw?

309
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:20,620
Well, you know,
maybe the back of it.

310
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:22,103
Try it with
the front of the saw.

311
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:23,103
It's not great.

312
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:24,517
What I'm most worried about

313
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,586
is them taking
our pot and our machete, okay?

314
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,172
If they really want
to play games, do that,

315
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,551
then it's just war.

316
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:31,413
We're at war, man.

317
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:34,931
The idea of wiping a tribe out
with the take of a machete.

318
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:36,724
You got to think long-term,
not short-term.

319
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,275
<i>This tribe's missing some grit.</i>

320
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:43,413
<i>For me, it's not
about what we're getting,</i>

321
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:44,413
<i>it's what we're inflicting,</i>

322
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:45,793
<i>because we have a tribe of four,</i>

323
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:47,344
and they're
a tribe of six and five.

324
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:49,793
<i>We are outnumbered.
We're tired, we're beat up.</i>

325
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,344
I don't agree with this. I think
we're being soft as hell.

326
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,827
The only way
that we can close that gap

327
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:56,413
is to kick 'em
in the shins, man.

328
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:57,862
<i>Really hit 'em hard.</i>

329
00:13:57,965 --> 00:13:59,275
God.

330
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:02,724
Sending a child off to school,

331
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:04,517
and I don't know
how he's gonna behave.

332
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,517
Yeah!

333
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:09,724
- Oh, my God.
- No way.

334
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:11,413
- No. No, no, no.
- No.

335
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,551
For real?

336
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:20,034
- Do you see that? <i>
- I might go over there
and take their machete,</i>

337
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:22,379
<i>'cause I might be looking around
and be like, "To hell with it.</i>

338
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:24,379
<i>"You know what? I'm making
an executive decision here.</i>

339
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:26,448
<i>Taking out
their Achilles' heel."</i>

340
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,000
- No, y'all.
- Oh, no.

341
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,689
No, y'all.

342
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,103
So they're coming for us?

343
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,241
- Yup.
- They really came for us.

344
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:37,827
Put my shoes back on.

345
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:40,034
- I had just gotten comfortable.
- Oh, my God.

346
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:41,620
- Hey.
- What's up, man?
- We don't

347
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,931
have anything. I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to go back.

348
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,310
<i>We were hoping they would</i>

349
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:47,482
<i>go after Baka
because they're, like,</i>

350
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,793
winning all the big rewards.

351
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:50,689
- Cody. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you, Cody.

352
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:52,206
Nice to meet you.

353
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,965
So when they come to our camp,
I'm just thinking, like,

354
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,103
<i>we still have
six people in this game,</i>

355
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:57,172
<i>they're down to four.</i>

356
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,172
<i>So they really want to give us,</i>

357
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:00,862
like, a hard blow, I guess,

358
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:03,034
just because
we have the numbers right now.

359
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,482
This is pretty sweet.

360
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:05,655
Thanks. Take a look.

361
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,206
Yeah, you're
more than welcome...

362
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,586
Yeah, I actually came over here
to kick down the post,

363
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:09,724
to kick it over.

364
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,034
That's what he was stealing,

365
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:12,896
the structure of our home.

366
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,034
Oh, yeah, very nice.

367
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:16,137
Nice work.

368
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:18,551
- Sure.
- So how are
y'all eating your fish?

369
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:20,517
Are y'all doing,
like, sashimi, or...?

370
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,172
Ah, very funny.

371
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:26,620
What are you here for?

372
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:29,068
I, okay, so,
I came over to steal...

373
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:30,655
I came over
to steal your machete.

374
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:33,448
- And...
- What good does
an extra machete do for you?

375
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:36,448
- It's-it's-it's a savage take.
I agree with you 100%.
- Okay.

376
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:39,275
But you also understand the
message that it's sending to us,

377
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,896
and what we're prepared
to do in retaliation.

378
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,965
<i>Right now, I just don't
want to lose the machete.</i>

379
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:46,689
<i>It's one of our
most useful tools.</i>

380
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:50,241
So anything that we can do
to make Cody happy

381
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:51,965
<i>- makes sense.</i>
- I'm not the strategist

382
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:53,724
of the group. I'm the,
I'm, like, the messenger here.

383
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,551
So if you came back with, like,
some food, would that,

384
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:56,862
would-would that be enough?

385
00:15:58,172 --> 00:15:59,862
Yeah.

386
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:01,379
<i>I've done sales for 13 years,</i>

387
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:02,793
and you don't
come into a negotiation

388
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:03,965
asking for what you want.

389
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:05,655
<i>That's Sales 101.</i>

390
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,724
<i>So I told them I wanted their
machete. They didn't like that.</i>

391
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:11,827
They started mumbling.
None of 'em knew what to do.

392
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:13,724
<i>They were kind of like, "Well,
what else would you like?"</i>

393
00:16:13,827 --> 00:16:15,931
<i>It was music to my ears.
At that point,</i>

394
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:17,896
you know,
I was in the driver's seat.

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,448
So you're saying,
in lieu of the machete,

396
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:20,517
you'll give me some food?

397
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,068
- Yeah.
- A lot.

398
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:24,689
- What?
- At least.
- Yes.

399
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,000
- What?
- Yeah, we got limes.

400
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:28,310
Limes are great.

401
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:29,965
Let me see
your refrigerator, man.

402
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:32,551
- Look at this.
- Tastes like mashed potatoes.

403
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:33,931
Boil it up, it's good.

404
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,517
Listen,
I mean, it's a good offer,

405
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,896
and I really appreciate it,

406
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,689
but the thing is,
we don't have fire right now.

407
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:41,310
So it does us no good tonight.

408
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,344
We need something that will
give us a longer life cycle.

409
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,034
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

410
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:51,103
What if we take, would you
give us the fishing gear

411
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:53,137
and a little bit of that?

412
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:55,965
What do you guys think?
It's a group decision.

413
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:57,689
- Is that a deal?
- I'm down for that.
- Yeah.

414
00:16:57,793 --> 00:16:59,724
And some limes. Can I get
a couple limes? 'Cause, man...

415
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:02,000
- Yeah. All right, yeah.
- Please.

416
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,068
Let me guess,
you got tequila back there, too?

417
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:07,103
Now that would be something.

418
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:09,551
<i>I turned on the charisma 110%,</i>

419
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,586
and Coco went
right into my trap.

420
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:13,034
Man, thank you guys so much.

421
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:14,793
Yeah. Thank you
for not taking our machete.

422
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,068
<i>It's a win-win.</i>

423
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:17,931
<i>I got more
than what I went for,</i>

424
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:21,517
<i>and Coco ended up extra happy,
because they were thinking</i>

425
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,689
they were getting
their machete taken.

426
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:23,862
Yeah. You're gonna love it.

427
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:26,896
This is the winning root. Huh?

428
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,206
Mahalo.

429
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,034
<i>I don't trust Cody at all.</i>

430
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:33,137
<i>He's like,
"Mahalo. Hawaii. I live</i>

431
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,931
on the island of Hawaii."
And I'm like,

432
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,931
"Bro, you're from Idaho.
Like, calm down."

433
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:40,034
Aloha, y'all.

434
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:41,034
<i>Coco definitely</i>

435
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:42,103
did not play it cool.

436
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:43,517
<i>We gave away our fishing gear</i>

437
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,724
<i>and too much food,</i>

438
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:47,068
<i>which strengthens the enemy.</i>

439
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,034
I know.

440
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:52,793
We're so bad at negotiating.

441
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:53,965
I think Cody played us.

442
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:56,103
Yahoo!

443
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:11,551
Come on in.

444
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,724
All right.

445
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:29,965
- Shall we get to
today's immunity challenge?
- Yeah.

446
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,448
First things first,
got to take back the idols.

447
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:34,137
I know, Owen.
You don't want to give it up.

448
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:35,620
I do not.

449
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:36,793
King Coco.

450
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:37,965
Blessings, Jeff.

451
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,448
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

452
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:47,586
For today's challenge,

453
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:51,241
<i>you're gonna race to knock
off a series of heavy sandbags.</i>

454
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:54,275
<i>You're looking
for a ring of keys.</i>

455
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:56,827
<i>You'll then use those keys
to unlock a net</i>

456
00:18:56,931 --> 00:19:01,000
<i>and drag four large puzzle
pieces underneath the net.</i>

457
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:03,724
<i>You'll then arrange
those pieces in a square.</i>

458
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:06,965
<i>Once you have the square
finished, you're gonna take</i>

459
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:09,827
<i>the same pieces,
go up a cargo net</i>

460
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:13,724
<i>to another platform and
rearrange them into a triangle.</i>

461
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:20,206
First two tribes
to finish win immunity.

462
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,413
Safe from the vote.

463
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:23,931
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody

464
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:27,448
will be the fourth person
voted out of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

465
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:29,896
Let's get to sit-outs.
Coco, you have two.

466
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,379
Cassidy and Geo are gonna
sit this out for Coco.

467
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:33,965
Baka, who's it gonna be?

468
00:19:34,068 --> 00:19:35,551
Jeanine gonna sit out for Baka.

469
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:37,172
Sit-outs on the bench. Everybody
else, give you a minute

470
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,275
to strategize.
We'll get started.

471
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:47,896
All right, here we go.

472
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,241
For immunity.
Survivors ready?

473
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:54,275
- Go!
- Let's go, Coco!

474
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:57,551
You've got to go over
and get all the sandbags off.

475
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,517
And you're looking
for one ring with keys on it.

476
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:04,482
Go, Coco!

477
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,344
Boy, everybody is tearing it up!

478
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:07,689
Let's go, Baka!

479
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:10,103
On day nine of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

480
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:14,068
- Right there. Grab it,
grab it, grab it.
- Baka! Go, Baka!

481
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:18,379
Every second is going
to count in this challenge.

482
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:23,137
- Yeah.
- You're good. Go, Vesi.

483
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:26,344
- It is Ryan unlocking for Coco.
- Let's go, guys!

484
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:27,931
Let's go, Ryan!

485
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:30,034
Got Cody unlocking for Vesi.
You're good.

486
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:31,586
Let's go, Elie.

487
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,620
Elie unlocking for Baka.
You're good, Baka.

488
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:35,655
- Yeah, okay, go.
- Let's go, Baka!

489
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:37,655
- Go. Go.
- It is Vesi in the lead.

490
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:40,137
- You got it.
- Ryan still struggling

491
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:41,586
to get the net unlocked.

492
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:44,448
- There we go.
- You got it. Go, Coco.

493
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:46,137
Let's go, guys! Hell yeah!

494
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:47,862
- Go.
- You got this, Baka.

495
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:50,413
It's gonna be Cody
through with the first piece.

496
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:54,206
- Here comes Baka.
- Come on, baby.

497
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,000
Sami's got one. Owen's got one.

498
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:58,000
Come on, Baka! Go!

499
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,862
- Lindsay's got one for Coco.
- Good job, Lindsay!

500
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,482
There goes Karla digging.

501
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:02,793
Ryan just holding that net up,

502
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:04,551
but he's not
grabbing a puzzle piece.

503
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:06,655
You got to get
all four of 'em back here.

504
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:10,344
Everybody working.
Lindsay takes a fall.

505
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:11,655
Yes! Yes! Yes!

506
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,620
Baka, you're good.

507
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:16,551
- Start untying.
- Let's go!

508
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,379
- Now you've
got to untie your bag.
- Let's go!

509
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:21,103
Vesi has all four puzzle pieces.
Start untying.

510
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:22,413
Yeah! Good job, Coco!

511
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,586
Coco, you're good.
You can untie.

512
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,344
- You got this, Baka!
- Go, guys!

513
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:28,689
Everybody got through
that first leg very quickly.

514
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:31,896
Now you've got to get the
puzzle pieces out of their bags.

515
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,137
Then two players
will form a square.

516
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:38,000
Got to get 'em all out
before you can start solving.

517
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:41,793
Dwight is moving about
as slow as you can move

518
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,655
and still actually be moving.

519
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:45,448
Thank you, Jeffrey.

520
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:48,931
Baka can start solving.

521
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:50,344
You got it, you got it,
you got it.

522
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:51,862
Coco, you're good.
Start solving.

523
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:53,482
Go, Coco!

524
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,965
Vesi has their fourth.
You're good.

525
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,758
This challenge is on.

526
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:01,724
Towards Owen, towards Owen,
towards Owen.

527
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:05,310
You're solving on that platform.
You're making a square.

528
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:08,034
Yep. Just like that.
And then put, um, rotate it.

529
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:10,758
You're experimenting right now
to see what works.

530
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,172
Up straight. There you go.

531
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:14,793
- How's that looking there?
- No.

532
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:16,413
- Shoot, I'm sorry.
- No.

533
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:19,758
There you go. That's it.
That's it. That's it.

534
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:24,965
Trial and error.
Just keep digging.

535
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,724
You got it, Baka.

536
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,379
Once you have it,
let me know.
- Jeff.

537
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,827
Baka thinks they have it,
and they do.

538
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:34,482
- That's a square.
- Can we kick it?

539
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,206
Move up the cargo net.

540
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,758
Hell yeah, Baka!

541
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:40,827
Baka quickly knocked it down
so nobody could even look.

542
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:43,379
Now you've got to get very heavy

543
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:46,275
puzzle pieces up this cargo net.

544
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:49,931
You earn it every single day
out here on <i>Survivor.</i>

545
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,034
Yes.

546
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,482
It is Coco and Vesi right now,
trying to get the square.

547
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:57,344
- Put that there!
- Go!

548
00:22:57,448 --> 00:22:59,103
Sami heading up for Baka.

549
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:01,241
Gabler with the first piece.

550
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:03,758
You got bodies underneath.

551
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:05,413
If you drop a piece,
they are heavy.

552
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,275
Send it here,
then knock it over.

553
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:09,448
- That's the way you do it, Baka.
- Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

554
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:12,482
Vesi thinks they have it,
and they do. That's good.

555
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:15,310
- Head up.
- Get on up there.
- You got this, Baka!

556
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:18,310
Get those pieces up there!

557
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:19,793
Go ahead, Jesse.
Keep going, Jesse.

558
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:20,931
Vesi now heading up.

559
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:23,413
Oh.

560
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:29,068
Coco in dead last again.

561
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:31,310
That piece, that piece
goes down on the ground.

562
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:34,172
They had it to where
it lined up like this.

563
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:36,103
- Elie, give me your hand.
- Thank you.

564
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,827
- Wait, wait, ow!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

565
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:40,379
Baka, you're good. Start.

566
00:23:40,482 --> 00:23:41,586
All you, Baka!

567
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,551
Help Dwight. Help Dwight.

568
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,448
- I'm fine.
- All right.

569
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,482
- Vesi has their four.
You're good.
- Nice, Dwight.

570
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:51,241
We're looking for two to finish
by building a triangle.

571
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:52,379
Flip that.

572
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:53,448
It is Jesse and Dwight...

573
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:54,448
One more time.

574
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:56,068
...Sami and Owen.

575
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:59,620
Immunity on the line.
Day nine, <i>Survivor 43.</i>

576
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:03,206
Coco's still working on their
first puzzle-- the square.

577
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,586
- Don't give up, Coco!
- Don't give up, Coco!

578
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:06,862
Jeff, we got it.

579
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:09,862
- Jeff! Jeff!
- You got it! Go, Coco!

580
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:11,689
Right on! Good job, Coco!

581
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:15,689
- Coco trying to stay in this.
- Go, Coco!

582
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:19,344
Coco, once again, has put
themselves back in competition.

583
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:24,137
Watch out.

584
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:28,758
There it is, all four pieces.
Now get up.

585
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:31,724
James, Ryan,
everybody's in it.

586
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:34,689
- Coco, once again,
not giving up.
- Here.

587
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:35,931
Good.

588
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,551
This one's bottom left, quickly.

589
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:38,620
- Quickly.
- No. No, that's not it.

590
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:39,758
It can't be it. It can't be it.

591
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,413
Do not get sassy.

592
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:44,896
I want you
to take that next piece.

593
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,586
Coco is making fast work
of this, if they can solve it.

594
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:51,172
- Ryan, keep that up there.
Ryan, slide that in.
- Ryan, Ryan...

595
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:52,896
Like so many <i>Survivor</i> puzzles,

596
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,413
once you see it,
it'll be so clear.

597
00:24:57,482 --> 00:25:00,448
But until you see it,
it's very difficult.

598
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:09,896
Vesi has it.
Vesi wins immunity.

599
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:14,000
Vesi has won
their first immunity challenge.

600
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:15,241
No Tribal Council.

601
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:19,896
It is now Baka and Coco
fighting to stay alive.

602
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,172
Right there.

603
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:22,551
- No, no, no.
- Long piece, long piece...

604
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:27,172
Can Baka pull it out
and send Coco to Tribal Council?

605
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,517
Elie, Elie, Elie.

606
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,241
Have him switch that over here.

607
00:25:31,344 --> 00:25:32,724
The longest side on the ground.

608
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:34,896
- That's the right... Flip it.
- Flip.
- Yes?

609
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,931
Push that in. It'll go.

610
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:38,137
- Yeah.
- There you go.

611
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,793
Vesi is very clearly
helping Baka,

612
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:42,655
trying to tell them
where their pieces go.

613
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,482
- Why?
- They're helping them?

614
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,137
- Yup. Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

615
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:47,551
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
- Come on, Baka!

616
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:49,068
- That's it.
- Spin yours.

617
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,517
Try it. We're gonna lose. Go.

618
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,655
- Keep going. Keep going...
- Owen gonna
try a different piece.

619
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:55,689
- Yeah.
- Do they have it?

620
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:57,724
- There we go.
- Jeff! Jeff!

621
00:25:57,827 --> 00:25:59,344
They do! Baka has it!

622
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,551
Baka pulls it out!

623
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,275
Baka safe, sending Coco
to Tribal Council

624
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:10,206
for the first time this season.

625
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,344
- Nice!
- Wow, what an effort.

626
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:19,344
A very clear division,
with Vesi helping Baka.

627
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:23,172
Vesi, congratulations.

628
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:25,758
First time you've had this.

629
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:27,413
Here's your flint.

630
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:29,068
Well-earned.

631
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,586
First time in a while we will
not see each other at Tribal.

632
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:34,965
Baka, hard-fought,
very close at the end.

633
00:26:35,068 --> 00:26:36,793
Baka's safe.

634
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:40,827
Baka, Vesi, grab your stuff,
head out, enjoy the night off.

635
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,793
- Thank you, sir.
- Thanks, Jeff.

636
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,551
Cassidy,
what do you make of the fact

637
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:53,758
that Vesi wasn't even hiding
that they were helping Baka?

638
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,931
I mean, there isn't any rules
in the game of <i>Survivor.</i>

639
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:58,137
There's definitely dirty play
that goes on, as we saw here.

640
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,103
They're uniting together
as the losers.

641
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:01,551
Um, we haven't lost yet,

642
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:03,310
and so they're trying
to just knock us down

643
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,275
- off of our pedestal.
- All right, Coco,

644
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:06,655
Tribal Council tonight.

645
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,172
Somebody from your tribe

646
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:11,344
will be the fourth person
voted out of this game.

647
00:27:11,448 --> 00:27:14,275
And as a penalty for losing,
I'm gonna take your flint.

648
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:16,827
Sorry for you.

649
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:20,931
All right, Coco,
grab your stuff, head out.

650
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:22,586
See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

651
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:23,931
<i>Losing sucks.</i>

652
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:25,896
The other two tribes
were working together,

653
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,034
<i>so once we hit the merge,</i>

654
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:31,413
I've got people that I...
that I want to get revenge on.

655
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,241
<i>But my biggest fear
is coming true.</i>

656
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:34,965
<i>We are going to Tribal Council.</i>

657
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:38,172
<i>And in a tribe of six,
there's no place to hide.</i>

658
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:58,068
<i>They had to help each other.</i>

659
00:27:58,172 --> 00:28:00,862
But y'all did amazing.
I'm really proud of y'all.

660
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:03,965
- Yep.
- This sucks, y'all.

661
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:06,241
I just want to eat
one more time together

662
00:28:06,344 --> 00:28:08,482
before we start strategizing.
We do have to.

663
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,862
Okay.

664
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:11,620
<i>Now that we lost,
our tribe has</i>

665
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,724
to experience something new
and something unpleasant.

666
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:15,689
<i>This is the first night
we have to scramble,</i>

667
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:17,586
<i>and right now,
the two people I trust the most,</i>

668
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:19,068
<i>it's gonna have to be
James and Geo.</i>

669
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:22,275
<i>Geo is my number one.
Somebody has to go home,</i>

670
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:25,137
and I got to keep the people
I trust as close as I can.

671
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:27,827
Probably gonna be a whole bunch
of names being thrown...

672
00:28:32,448 --> 00:28:35,586
<i>I'm not gonna lie. I'm kind
of excited about Tribal Council.</i>

673
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:38,448
And my master plan
is to take out Cassidy tonight.

674
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,103
We're gonna vote for Cassidy.

675
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:44,862
- Whatever I have to do
to stay in the game, right?
- Yeah.

676
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:45,896
<i>I don't know.
I feel like I'm just</i>

677
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,413
calling the shots right now.

678
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,241
<i>I feel like
I can't trust Cassidy</i>

679
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:52,517
<i>as much as everybody else.
And I can</i>

680
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,068
feel it in my bones
when I talk to her. I can feel

681
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:58,137
<i>that she's probably gonna
turn around and backstab me.</i>

682
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:00,793
Wait. You know,
wait, wait, wait, don't...

683
00:29:00,896 --> 00:29:02,344
Okay, I was gonna
show you something.

684
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:06,344
When I cut 'em up, I cut 'em up
exactly in the center,

685
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:08,551
- where e-everything
looks almost exactly the same.
- Okay.

686
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:09,793
And that's why...

687
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:11,724
No, no, no.
You continue doing it.

688
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:17,172
<i>It's like, "Why don't
you just cut it then,</i>

689
00:29:17,275 --> 00:29:18,896
<i>if it's, like, so important?"</i>

690
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,344
- We can do it
your way this time,
- No, no.

691
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:22,827
- and if it works, then...
- It's not like it's my way.

692
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:27,034
Geo's definitely, like,
grating on my nerves, for sure.

693
00:29:27,137 --> 00:29:28,793
He's gotten a little big
for his britches, in my opinion.

694
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:30,068
He's being sassy to everybody,
and I think

695
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:32,068
- that's because... Yes.
- Is he?

696
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:34,379
- Yeah.
- He's been... I've seen him
be sassy to multiple people...

697
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:35,482
<i>Yeah.</i>

698
00:29:37,724 --> 00:29:38,758
Yeah.

699
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:43,172
<i>I want to get Geo out,
and I don't think that</i>

700
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:46,172
he would blink an eye
if he had to turn on me.

701
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:50,655
I want to go Geo.

702
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:52,206
Perfect. I'm down.

703
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,758
<i>Geo is playing</i>

704
00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:56,275
a "I call the shots" game.

705
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:59,275
<i>No. There's no way
Cassidy's going home.</i>

706
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:01,241
<i>Tonight, we're voting for Geo.</i>

707
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:03,000
It's the easiest vote.

708
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:05,551
Do you know if
my name has ever come up?

709
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:06,689
No.

710
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:09,586
Nobody's saying
anything right now.

711
00:30:09,689 --> 00:30:11,896
The plan right now
is for us to vote Geo,

712
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,034
<i>and something's
just not adding up.</i>

713
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:15,862
<i>I say that
because this is</i> Survivor,

714
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:19,862
<i>and it's never
as easy as it seems.</i>

715
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:25,000
<i>It's making me, especially,
pretty paranoid.</i>

716
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:29,448
I don't know why.

717
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:34,689
<i>You know, maybe it's the fact
that everybody's continuously</i>

718
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:37,379
<i>running around this island,
trying to strategize.</i>

719
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:40,103
<i>I don't understand
why we have to keep going off</i>

720
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,793
if the plan's already in place.

721
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:45,724
...feel like we can
start talking strategy.

722
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,241
You know, they're
talking right now.

723
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:49,655
After we eat this,
strategy season is open.

724
00:30:49,758 --> 00:30:52,068
<i>My gut is telling me,
"Of course they would</i>

725
00:30:52,172 --> 00:30:54,482
target me."
I-I feel like

726
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,310
I'm somebody that
needs to be targeted.

727
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:58,172
Ryan won't even
strategize with me.

728
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:00,413
Fine. Don't talk to me.

729
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:02,241
<i>If I'm being honest,
I'm a huge threat--</i>

730
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:04,482
<i>physically, socially,</i>

731
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:06,068
um, and strategically.

732
00:31:06,172 --> 00:31:07,379
How are you feeling? Like,
what's going through your head

733
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:09,758
- right now, Lindsay?
- I'm super paranoid

734
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:12,034
that it's gonna be me tonight.

735
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,068
No.

736
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,379
Oh, my gosh.
What-what can I do

737
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,827
to reassure you that it's not?

738
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:19,862
I just want to know who's lying.

739
00:31:26,172 --> 00:31:28,620
<i>I don't trust anybody right now.</i>

740
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:29,655
<i>This is</i> Survivor, <i>and</i>

741
00:31:29,758 --> 00:31:31,448
it'd be silly for me to do so.

742
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:34,551
But that paranoia is
too difficult to work with.

743
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:36,931
I completely understand
and agree with that.

744
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:39,103
Dude, are you...
you'd be down to flip?

745
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:41,103
If she's this paranoid?

746
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:42,344
She's paranoid as hell.

747
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:44,689
I'm gonna talk to her
to calm her down.

748
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:50,103
- Yeah, but Karla's
acting funny. I mean...
- Karla's not acting funny.

749
00:31:50,206 --> 00:31:52,068
We both, me and Karla
are on the same page.

750
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:53,862
We're trying
to get you to realize...

751
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:56,689
<i>Madness.</i>

752
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:58,965
<i>You tell people they're safe,</i>

753
00:31:59,068 --> 00:32:02,103
and for some reason that's just
not good enough for them.

754
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:04,310
Are y'all in an alliance?
And that's the thing.

755
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:06,689
- I don't feel like it,
at this point.
- No, no, look. Think about it.

756
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:08,862
- I think Karla's
lying to me, too.
- No, no, no. She's not.

757
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:11,068
Look at me.
You are not the target tonight.

758
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:12,965
What you can't do
is sketch out the people

759
00:32:13,068 --> 00:32:14,275
that are voting with you.

760
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:15,551
<i>I'm trying to make it
so Lindsay</i>

761
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:17,103
<i>doesn't go home,
but when you start</i>

762
00:32:17,206 --> 00:32:18,620
blowing up the game with people
trying to protect you

763
00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:20,620
on the first freaking vote...

764
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:25,379
- ...I can't convince you.
- All right, then-then that's it.

765
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:27,275
- I'm gonna trust you.
- Thank you.

766
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,689
<i>And the thing about it is,</i>

767
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:30,551
<i>it wasn't Lindsay
maybe two hours ago.</i>

768
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:31,758
<i>And you didn't trust me,</i>

769
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:33,758
and you may just go home.

770
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:37,931
All right, I just need to go...

771
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:39,896
- Let's go to the well
really fast.
- All right.

772
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,655
You and I are the swing votes.

773
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,068
- You know this, right? Okay.
- Yeah, 'cause right now
it's Geo.

774
00:32:49,172 --> 00:32:51,344
Geo or Lindsay.

775
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,206
I know.

776
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,620
<i>So we're set to go after Geo,</i>

777
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:00,206
<i>but Lindsay's starting
to show signs of paranoia.</i>

778
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,482
<i>It's literally not you.</i>

779
00:33:02,586 --> 00:33:04,689
<i>I don't know what's going
through her head, but it's like</i>

780
00:33:04,793 --> 00:33:07,482
telling your drunk friend
that they can't drink anymore,

781
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,241
that they're not allowed to go
into the bar, and they're like,

782
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:10,724
"I can, I can," and you're like,
"Stop drinking."

783
00:33:10,827 --> 00:33:12,655
<i>And it's just, like,
they don't listen.</i>

784
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,620
<i>She may have just
shot herself in the foot.</i>

785
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:17,000
Right now, chaos just erupted...

786
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:20,344
Yes.

787
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,689
- She's literally
ruining the game right now.
- I know.

788
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,655
She's ruining her own game
by doing this.

789
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:27,103
<i>But at the same time,
Geo right now is power-hungry</i>

790
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,689
and thinking that he can
kind of, like, boss me around.

791
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:32,103
<i>That ego is getting in the way.</i>

792
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:34,931
- Geo.
- Cool beans.

793
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:37,068
I'm putting
all my trust in you guys.

794
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,172
- Sounds like a plan.
- All right.

795
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:40,758
I love you guys.

796
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:42,275
<i>Geo is the easiest vote
right now.</i>

797
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:45,551
<i>We have the numbers,
but I knew coming intoSurvivor</i>

798
00:33:45,655 --> 00:33:47,620
<i>that it was
gonna be really complicated.</i>

799
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:49,344
And it's game on.

800
00:34:08,517 --> 00:34:10,000
Hello, Jeff.

801
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:12,034
Wow.

802
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:15,448
This may be
the most raucous entrance

803
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:17,275
to a first Tribal.

804
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:21,379
Group of torches back there.
Grab one, dip it in, get fire.

805
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:32,241
This is part of the ritual
of Tribal Council,

806
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:36,413
because, as you know, in this
game, fire represents your life.

807
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:40,551
When your fire is gone,
so are you.

808
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:43,517
Sadly, that will be the case
for one of you tonight.

809
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,793
All right,
so I need a little catch-up,

810
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:49,862
because this is
our first time together.

811
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:53,172
So, Ryan,
what grade would you give

812
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:54,931
the tribe
for these first nine days,

813
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:58,896
based on camp life, and shelter,
and fire and all that stuff?

814
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,241
I'd give us about an 8.5.

815
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:02,344
We don't bicker very often,

816
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:04,517
though it does happen,
like a family.

817
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,620
- But we've eaten every night,
most of the time, so...
- Wow.

818
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:10,862
Well, Geo and Ryan,
they're the papaya boys.

819
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:12,965
And they run around.

820
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:14,965
They do their thing around camp
to keep us fed.

821
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:17,896
Yeah, when I care for people,
I want to provide for them.

822
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,724
I've gotten to spear fish. I've
gotten papaya for everybody.

823
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,551
I climbed a coconut tree,
and I got a coconut, Jeff.

824
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:24,793
- And I...
- Let's stop there for a minute,

825
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:28,344
because when's
the last time you did that?

826
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:29,931
I've never
climbed a coconut tree, Jeff.

827
00:35:30,034 --> 00:35:31,724
Never.

828
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:34,172
So I think we got to
take these moments in,

829
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:36,586
because, of course, <i>
Survivor</i> is a game.

830
00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:40,137
We all know that, but I'm always
the one sort of preaching

831
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:42,896
that it's the adventure
that you make it, as well.

832
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,379
Yeah, Jeff, I have to say, I
really took your words to heart.

833
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:49,344
So, Lindsay,
what have you learned

834
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:52,586
from nine days of hard work,
trying to get along?

835
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:54,758
Because I feel like
Coco has gotten

836
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,896
as much juice out
of every papaya

837
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,827
that you can, so to speak.

838
00:35:58,931 --> 00:36:01,862
We have, and we know
what works right now for us.

839
00:36:01,965 --> 00:36:05,793
We know what it takes to win.
And then today happened.

840
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,551
So, um, today was definitely
a wake-up call for us.

841
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:11,206
Immediately, everyone started
breaking out into groups.

842
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,551
Some people spoke
a little bit more than others.

843
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,000
Some people didn't speak at all.

844
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:17,862
Um, I'm curious to see
if those people

845
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:20,068
will reveal themselves
and maybe explain why

846
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:22,137
they didn't feel like
they needed to have

847
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:24,310
a conversation with me tonight.

848
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:28,827
I actually

849
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:30,965
didn't get that energy
of, "I need to talk to you.

850
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:32,551
Like, I want
to strategize with you."

851
00:36:32,655 --> 00:36:35,000
How do you receive that?

852
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:37,482
I think the people that wanted
to have conversations

853
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:40,068
with me today
made it a priority.

854
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:43,551
Okay, so that's a rejection.

855
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:45,310
Geo, does that concern you

856
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:47,448
or does that make you happy
when there's a little stress

857
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:51,241
between two other tribe members
at Tribal?

858
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:55,034
As long as the vote
is not on me, I am happy.

859
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:57,965
But I've been nervous
all afternoon.

860
00:36:58,068 --> 00:37:01,000
I kind of feel like, you know,
when you're a child

861
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:02,931
and you get in trouble
with your parents,

862
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:05,034
and they take the TV away
from me? It's like

863
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:07,482
you're the parent and the TV
is the flint.

864
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:09,551
Okay. I'm the parent.

865
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:12,275
I'm the fun killer,
and now you all have to

866
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:14,482
come in here
and get a lecture from me.

867
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:16,448
Why am I always the parent?

868
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:18,620
I don't know,
but that's how I feel right now,

869
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:21,241
and I've been nervous all night.
And if you're not nervous

870
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:23,586
on Tribal Council,
then something's wrong with you.

871
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:26,034
Karla,
what did you notice happening

872
00:37:26,137 --> 00:37:28,758
when you all got back to camp
after the challenge?

873
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:30,241
Naturally, there was a scramble,

874
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:32,379
and you're kind of
fact-checking.

875
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:33,896
You kind of have
to do full circle

876
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,620
to ensure
that every single person

877
00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:37,620
that you said
you're solid with is solid.

878
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:41,206
If not, then you have to figure
out where did that go wrong, or,

879
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,034
if you're solid, you're solid.

880
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:45,793
Lindsay, fact-checking in
a conversation is a great part

881
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,241
- of playing <i>Survivor.</i>
- Right.

882
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:49,241
Were you doing that today?

883
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:51,793
Uh, probably a little too much.

884
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:54,275
I was definitely
getting paranoid,

885
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:55,827
and everyone
definitely noticed that.

886
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:57,896
But then I realized. "Wait.

887
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,448
"If you keep revisiting
these conversations,

888
00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:01,931
- Mm-hmm.
-"it's gonna create paranoia

889
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:04,137
"within the people
that you just solidified

890
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,137
your-your votes with."

891
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:09,482
So, Geo, given that you felt

892
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:10,931
your own version of paranoia--
that the parents were mad

893
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,344
and they're gonna
take the remote

894
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:14,689
and all that stuff--
when you sense

895
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,931
Lindsay spiraling a little bit,
do you go in to try to help?

896
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:20,793
I just want to make sure
I keep my people calm.

897
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:22,724
You know, the people
that I spoke to, calm,

898
00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:24,379
so that way,
they won't freak out.

899
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:26,793
But sometimes the waters
might look calm on the surface,

900
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:29,413
but underneath, like, there's
stuff happening, you know?

901
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:32,344
And it's-it's... it's gonna
get messy no matter what.

902
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,655
Well, I know somebody's going to
be hurt at the end of the day.

903
00:38:35,758 --> 00:38:38,965
- It's part of the game.
- James, what were you trying

904
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:40,482
to accomplish this afternoon?

905
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:42,620
Well, I was chilling at camp
for a lot of the time.

906
00:38:42,724 --> 00:38:45,172
That's my calm demeanor,
and that's how

907
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:47,206
I assure the people
that you're working with

908
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,517
that you're going to do what
you said you're going to do.

909
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,620
That's an interesting approach.

910
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:54,551
"I'm just gonna chill.

911
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:56,068
That's how I'm gonna
show you trust."

912
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:58,689
But that's the part of this game
that's so complicated,

913
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:00,448
which is,
"Of course I'm gonna front

914
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:03,000
-"like I trust everybody,
but inside,
- Yeah.

915
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:04,724
my heart is like,
'What if I'm the one?'"

916
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:06,827
Yeah. I mean, yeah,
that's a real

917
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:08,620
emotional battle
that you have to face

918
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:11,517
because things can change every
day, every second in this game.

919
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,896
And the only way that you can
really demonstrate trust

920
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,275
is by voting.

921
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:18,137
So, Karla, how close

922
00:39:18,241 --> 00:39:21,206
to the sun setting were you all
still talking about the vote?

923
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,620
It didn't stop.

924
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:24,379
- I mean, it-it...
- We didn't get to finish.

925
00:39:24,482 --> 00:39:26,000
We didn't get to finish.
Yeah. Like,

926
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:27,931
- if we had more time...
- Agreed.
- We didn't get to finish.

927
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,413
- ...we wouldn't
stop talking, yeah.
- Really?

928
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:30,827
Really?

929
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:32,655
So what is that indicative of?

930
00:39:35,551 --> 00:39:37,689
There's still
a lot of questions in the air.

931
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,551
And that is the paranoia.

932
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:43,379
All right, with that, it is

933
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:45,689
time to vote.
Lindsay, you're up.

934
00:40:17,896 --> 00:40:19,862
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol,

935
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:22,689
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

936
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,965
Okay, I'll read the votes.

937
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:35,586
First vote: Cassidy.

938
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:44,000
Geo.
One vote Cassidy, one vote Geo.

939
00:40:48,206 --> 00:40:50,793
Lindsay.
That's one vote Cassidy,

940
00:40:50,896 --> 00:40:53,896
one vote Geo,
one vote Lindsay.

941
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:01,241
Lindsay. That's two votes
Lindsay, one vote Cassidy,

942
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:03,310
one vote Geo.

943
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:10,965
Fourth person voted out
of <i>Survivor 43:</i> Lindsay.

944
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,862
That's three. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

945
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,586
Lindsay, the tribe has spoken.

946
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,241
Time for you to go.

947
00:41:42,172 --> 00:41:44,517
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

948
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,379
Good night.

Oh.

958
00:42:16,862 --> 00:42:17,827
I could mess some things up.

959
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:18,758
<i>Boom. Over.</i>

960
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:20,448
We are screwed.

<i>Now the game

962
00:42:26,551 --> 00:42:27,965
I thought my alliance

965

966
00:42:33,448 --> 00:42:35,448

967
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:37,275
