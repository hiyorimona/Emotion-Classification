509
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:28,965
I don't really think Gabler has
too much of a shot right now.

510
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:30,758
I don't-I don't think so,
either. I love the guy, but...

511
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:32,034
- But...
- I don't think people would
take him seriously as a...

512
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:34,275
Yeah. So I think
I need that move.

513
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,103
I think you need it, and I think
she's more threatening

514
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:38,896
than Jesse in terms
of challenges and fire.

515
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,931
Yup. So are we feeling,
like, Karla tonight?

516
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:44,482
- That's how I feel. Do you...
- Yeah.

517
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:46,724
- You feel that way, too?
- Yeah, I think so.

518
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:49,482
<i>Everybody who's come after me
and written my name down,</i>

519
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:51,241
<i>I've managed to blindside
and get out of the game.</i>

520
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:53,000
<i>And with Karla,
I think it would be a good move</i>

521
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:56,206
for me to get her out
before she tries to get me out.

522
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,344
- All right.
- All right.

523
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,793
[chopping]

524
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,448
[chopping continues]

525
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,206
All right, this will be my steak
and potato

526
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,827
and eggplant right here.

527
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,965
<i>I am crushed, actually.</i>

528
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,310
<i>I was hoping that, uh,</i>

529
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:33,068
Owen would pick me
today because

530
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,517
I just have
so little in the tank,

531
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,586
and it's such
an important time in the game.

532
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:42,275
<i>And I feel like, you know,
mentally, I'm breaking down.</i>

533
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,896
Gosh, we've been
absolutely starving out here.

534
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,310
<i>I don't think
you can underestimate</i>

535
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:51,793
<i>how important it is
to have nourishment</i>

536
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:53,551
at the eleventh hour.

537
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:56,689
Just got to pull it together
a little bit longer.

538
00:24:56,793 --> 00:24:58,689
And I'm just hopeful that...

539
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:00,517
I can hold it together
another couple days.

540
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:06,379
It's gonna be between
me and you.

541
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:08,482
- Yeah.
- That's-that's the hard part.

542
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:10,517
I don't know
what the hell to do.

543
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,206
Cass. It...
We have to flip it on Cass.

544
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,724
That's literally the only way.

545
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:16,931
Is Owen gonna
go for that, though?

546
00:25:17,034 --> 00:25:19,103
No, we have to get Gabler.

547
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,724
<i>JESSE:
I have Jeanine's idol,
and nobody knows it,</i>

548
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:25,206
<i>so I'm gonna play it tonight
for myself so I'm safe.</i>

549
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,689
<i>But right now,</i>

550
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,172
I'm just nervous.
I'm nervous about,

551
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:29,931
you know, the path forward.

552
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,689
- He's voted with you, right?
- He has.

553
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:34,586
<i>The winner of
the final immunity challenge--</i>

554
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:36,758
<i>they get to choose who they
sit with in the final three,</i>

555
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:39,103
<i>and the other two have
to have a fire-making challenge.</i>

556
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,965
<i>Me and Karla
are being perceived as, like,</i>

557
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:44,206
<i>the top threats in this game.</i>

558
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,724
<i>So, if Karla gets taken out</i>

559
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,379
and I make it final four
and I don't win immunity,

560
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:50,241
<i>they would want me
to make fire, and</i>

561
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:51,896
I don't want
to go out in fire.

562
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,620
Like, I don't want to go out.
I want to make it to the end.

563
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm more scared
about tonight than last night.

564
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:59,344
You don't say.

565
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,862
<i>I am pitching Cassidy to Jesse,</i>

566
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:03,724
<i>but in reality,
I want to put a target</i>

567
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:05,965
on Jesse's back
because he just made

568
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:08,379
what I think to be
the biggest move of this season.

569
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:10,793
<i>So I want
to paint that target on him</i>

570
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:12,448
so that
there is no target on me.

571
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:15,000
So, what's going down?

572
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:16,413
- So...
- JESSE: I mean,
I'm gonna be straight.

573
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:17,965
- Like...
- GABLER: Tell me.

574
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:19,275
So, I think if we want
to improve our odds

575
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:21,724
of making it to final four,

576
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,655
we take out Cass.

577
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:27,068
GABLER:
Just got to figure out

578
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:28,758
what's gonna be best
for my game.

579
00:26:28,862 --> 00:26:30,724
And who's most likely
to win a challenge?

580
00:26:30,827 --> 00:26:32,344
Not me, at this point.

581
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:33,827
- Cass and Owen are winning.
- I know.

582
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:35,482
And they just got refueled.

583
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:37,620
<i>They want to vote
for Cassidy, but,</i>

584
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,344
<i>right now, I think
I want to be sitting next</i>

585
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:42,068
<i>to Cassidy and Owen
at the final three.</i>

586
00:26:42,172 --> 00:26:44,103
I think I've got
a better story to tell

587
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:45,689
than either of those two.

588
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:47,586
- Absolutely.
- Hey. Oh!
- Oh!

589
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:50,517
<i>GABLER:
So my goal is to</i>

590
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,758
<i>take out Karla and Jesse.</i>

591
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:56,137
If that happens, then I think

592
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,241
I've got a really good shot
at the million dollars.

593
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:08,137
I think that's
the smartest way to go.

594
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:09,862
I think that's
the only way to go.

595
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:11,655
He does have a perfect record,

596
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:14,379
and he hasn't been
voted against.

597
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:17,896
And, uh, he's been
on the right side, I think,

598
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,689
- of every vote post-merge.
- Yeah.

599
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:23,931
<i>KARLA:
Right now, I need to have
one-on-one times with Owen</i>

600
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:26,344
and Cassidy and, uh,
Gabler to show them

601
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:28,206
<i>how big of a threat Jesse is.</i>

602
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,034
<i>And if they don't see it,</i>

603
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:31,275
they're dumb as hell.

604
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:33,517
- No one's ever voted for him.
- Okay.

605
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,172
- He just stole Cody's idol
and flushed two idols.
- Mm-hmm.

606
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:39,172
- Um...
- That was a historic move.

607
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:41,758
- He had...
- And that was all his idea.

608
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:43,413
<i>I already have considered
possibly voting for Jesse.</i>

609
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:45,068
<i>I'm not stupid.</i>

610
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:48,827
<i>I fully acknowledge Jesse is
a huge threat in his own right.</i>

611
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,068
But Karla... [whistles]
She can talk.

612
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,241
- You make some
good points, Karla.
- Yeah.

613
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:54,448
<i>OWEN:
And she is putting forth</i>

614
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:56,310
<i>a very solid argument</i>

615
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:57,965
<i>that Jesse needs to go.</i>

616
00:27:58,068 --> 00:27:59,310
And she's not wrong.

617
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:01,448
I mean, if he makes it
to the end, he wins.

618
00:28:01,551 --> 00:28:02,965
Yes.

619
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,965
<i>OWEN:
Decisions like this are critical</i>

620
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:06,862
<i>at this stage
of the game because</i>

621
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:10,758
this vote sets the table
for the final immunity challenge

622
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:14,000
<i>and the final Tribal Council,
and I didn't come all this way,</i>

623
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:17,068
I didn't come back from being
left out of those early votes

624
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,482
just to be
a zero-vote finalist.

625
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:22,862
So I need to think long and hard
about what's best for my game.

626
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:26,586
Where do you think
you stand in a

627
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:30,448
Gabler, Owen, Jesse, you?

628
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:32,275
I think that I have
a pretty good shot

629
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:35,000
- of getting
to the final three with them.
- Okay.

630
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:37,241
But you have Jesse,

631
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:40,724
who just played the most massive
move in all of the season.

632
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:42,793
- Do you not see that?
And then, but then...
- I do.

633
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:44,758
But he's not gonna say,
"Thank you, Cassidy,

634
00:28:44,862 --> 00:28:46,172
"thank you, Gabler,
thank you, Owen,

635
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:47,862
for helping me make this move."

636
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:49,413
- I'm not an idiot, Karla.
- Okay, well, that's what I...

637
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:50,896
- You don't need
to look out for me.
- Yeah? I mean...

638
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,413
You don't need to, like,
make me aware of these things.

639
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,241
- I understand the game.
- Okay. So, then, I'm...

640
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:55,551
I'm trying to figure out how

641
00:28:55,655 --> 00:28:56,862
you're gonna use that
to your advantage.

642
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:58,241
<i>CASSIDY:
Karla was definitely trying</i>

643
00:28:58,344 --> 00:28:59,965
<i>to stir up a lot of chaos,
'cause at first,</i>

644
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:01,862
she starts trying
to kind of pitch Jesse

645
00:29:01,965 --> 00:29:03,482
and how he played
a way better game than me.

646
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:05,275
<i>And when she starts realizing</i>

647
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:07,379
<i>that's not really gonna work,
she starts trying all</i>

648
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,103
these different tactics, like,
basically throwing anything

649
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,551
at the wall
to see what will stick.

650
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:13,931
Any of the Coco votes,
anything pre-merge,

651
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:16,965
I don't know if you will be able
to use as gameplay

652
00:29:17,068 --> 00:29:18,896
because it was all me and James.

653
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,827
So if you go home tonight,
that's what you're gonna

654
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:23,655
- go tell the jury?
That it was all...
- Of course.

655
00:29:23,758 --> 00:29:25,068
- Because I'll be on the jury.
- Yeah.

656
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:26,517
And my vote is not
gonna go to you.

657
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,758
<i>Karla tried to pull this, like,
whole scare tactic on me</i>

658
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:32,758
where she's gonna come after me

659
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:34,448
and smear my name
to the jury, and I...

660
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:36,275
You know, I just kind of
lost a lot of respect for her

661
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:38,379
for pulling that move on me

662
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:40,448
<i>when we've played
so long together.</i>

663
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:43,896
<i>I think she's upset that I maybe
have gotten the better of her</i>

664
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,241
<i>and that I've formed</i>

665
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,310
better social relationships
and outwitted her

666
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:49,000
to the point where I'm gonna
be the one in the final four

667
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:50,517
and potentially not her.

668
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,689
<i>And so I'm worried
about what she might do tonight.</i>

669
00:29:59,137 --> 00:30:01,379
She's literally been throwing
your name out all day...

670
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:07,068
I'm frustrated that Karla is
trying to paint a target on me

671
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,172
<i>because, like,
the plan was to vote for Cass.</i>

672
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,517
I mean, she's pretty convinced

Dwight pulled a switcheroo

- What is the fear?
- Yeah, I mean,

1012
00:48:56,965 --> 00:48:58,931
it's beyond description.

1013
00:48:59,034 --> 00:49:03,172
Um, for me, like, I looked up
to so many amazing women

1014
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:05,586
that played this game, and now
I'm just thinking, like,

1015
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:07,655
I might be that person
who's inspiring

1016
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:09,793
other little girls to come out
and live out their dream.

1017
00:49:09,896 --> 00:49:11,551
And, like, you can be a badass.

1018
00:49:11,655 --> 00:49:13,206
You can... you can do it,
and I...

1019
00:49:14,206 --> 00:49:15,827
I mean, this could be a
million-dollar necklace for me.

1020
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:19,310
I'm just really grateful to have
the power that I do tonight.

1021
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:21,103
PROBST:
Now you have two big decisions.

1022
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:22,827
Who do you put next to you--

1023
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:25,379
which is probably somebody
you believe you can beat--

1024
00:49:25,482 --> 00:49:28,000
and who do you force
to make fire, which, in theory,

1025
00:49:28,103 --> 00:49:31,172
would be somebody you're
uncertain if you can beat.

1026
00:49:31,275 --> 00:49:33,275
One thing we know for sure--
you're not gonna be voted out.

1027
00:49:33,379 --> 00:49:34,931
You want to be
at the final three.

1028
00:49:35,034 --> 00:49:36,448
- You're in the final three. Congratulations.
- Hell yeah.

1029
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:38,034
- CASSIDY: Thank you so much.
- Great job, Cass.

1030
00:49:38,137 --> 00:49:40,137
As for the rest of you,
busy afternoon.

1031
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:42,034
I'm sure there's gonna be
a lot of politicking going on.

1032
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:43,172
I'll give you time
to get to it.

1033
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:44,655
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

1034
00:49:44,758 --> 00:49:46,758
- Thank you.
- See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

1035
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:48,724
<i>CASSIDY:
This was the biggest win
of the season for me.</i>

1036
00:49:48,827 --> 00:49:51,103
It comes with
a really heavy decision.

1037
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:53,931
<i>You have to consider,</i>

1038
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:55,793
who do I want
to have to make fire?

1039
00:49:59,034 --> 00:50:01,724
<i>CASSIDY:
And Jesse, just based
on his performances</i>

1040
00:50:01,827 --> 00:50:04,068
<i>at the last two
Tribal Councils, I really</i>

1041
00:50:04,172 --> 00:50:05,827
don't feel comfortable
sitting next to Jesse right now.

1042
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:08,413
<i>So my big question is
who do I think has a better shot</i>

1043
00:50:08,517 --> 00:50:12,758
<i>of beating Jesse
in this fire-making challenge?</i>

♪ ♪

1045
00:50:27,586 --> 00:50:30,965
I won the final immunity
challenge! Oh, my God.

1046
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:34,103
<i>I knew how crucial
this win was for me.</i>

1047
00:50:34,206 --> 00:50:35,931
<i>I mean, being able</i>

00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,103
to have this power
in the game

1049
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:38,517
<i>and not leave my fate to one</i>

1050
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,965
<i>of my fellow tribemates
right now...</i>

1051
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:42,000
- So close.
- I know.

1052
00:50:42,103 --> 00:50:44,103
<i>That also gives me the power
to make a decision tonight</i>

1053
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:45,793
about who I want
to see face off in fire.

1054
00:50:45,896 --> 00:50:48,482
And so, I mean, this win could
not have come at a better time.

1055
00:50:48,586 --> 00:50:50,620
Oh. Oh, God.

1056
00:50:50,724 --> 00:50:52,586
- GABLER: Nice work.
- CASSIDY: Oh.

1057
00:50:52,689 --> 00:50:54,620
- Nice. Hi.
- Nice work.
- Nice work. What's that?

1058
00:50:54,724 --> 00:50:56,862
- Oh, that's our...
- Practice.
- Wow.

1059
00:50:56,965 --> 00:50:58,724
<i>OWEN: I spent the whole
walk back from the challenge</i>

1060
00:50:58,827 --> 00:51:00,517
<i>thinking about what's best
for my game,</i>

1061
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,758
and it was conflicting,
'cause what would be best

1062
00:51:03,862 --> 00:51:05,137
for my chances
of winning would be

1063
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:06,827
to go head-to-head
against Jesse.

1064
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:10,689
<i>I think, to the jury,
Jesse is the top dog.</i>

1065
00:51:10,793 --> 00:51:12,000
He is the biggest threat to win,

1066
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:13,448
and he will be
making a fire tonight.

1067
00:51:14,758 --> 00:51:16,931
<i>So if I were to go
to fire and win,</i>

1068
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:19,344
<i>that would be my best chance</i>

1069
00:51:19,448 --> 00:51:20,724
of getting votes
at final Tribal.

1070
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,379
<i>But losing today
in such close fashion--</i>

1071
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:27,344
<i>it's just defeating
to get knocked down once again.</i>

1072
00:51:27,448 --> 00:51:31,517
<i>You know, you take enough hits
in a day or in 25 days.</i>

1073
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,517
<i>Like, you reach a point
where you're just tired.</i>

1074
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,379
<i>And part of me almost just said,
"I'm ready to give up."</i>

1075
00:51:37,482 --> 00:51:39,482
<i>But that's not what I want</i>

1076
00:51:39,586 --> 00:51:41,379
to take away from this game,
and that's not...

1077
00:51:41,482 --> 00:51:43,655
that's not what
all this has been about.

1078
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:45,689
<i>One of life's great lessons is</i>

1079
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:47,620
<i>what do you do
when you fall down?</i>

1080
00:51:47,724 --> 00:51:49,620
You get back up.
And today,

1081
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:51,827
<i>I fell.</i>

1082
00:51:51,931 --> 00:51:54,034
<i>And I kind of laid there</i>

1083
00:51:54,137 --> 00:51:56,344
for a while, and...

1084
00:51:58,275 --> 00:52:00,310
<i>...that's not... that's not me.</i>

1085
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:02,517
<i>That's really not me.</i>

1086
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,586
<i>That's not who I am as a person.
I'm not a quitter.</i>

1087
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:06,551
<i>I'm gonna give Cassidy a crack,</i>

1088
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:08,827
see if I can
get myself into fire

1089
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:12,034
<i>and take out Jesse
in the fire-making challenge.</i>

1090
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:13,551
I firmly believe that

1091
00:52:13,655 --> 00:52:15,620
- if you put me in
against Jesse...
- Mm-hmm.

1092
00:52:15,724 --> 00:52:17,172
- I win.
- Yeah.

1093
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:18,689
Like, I genuinely believe that.

1094
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:20,655
So you just need to figure out
if you think Gabler

1095
00:52:20,758 --> 00:52:22,000
or I has a better chance of...

1096
00:52:22,103 --> 00:52:23,448
Yeah. I just... I need

1097
00:52:23,551 --> 00:52:25,448
- whoever goes
against Jesse to win.
- To win.

1098
00:52:27,931 --> 00:52:29,586
<i>JESSE:
It sucks.</i>

1099
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:31,620
<i>I haven't won a single
immunity challenge.</i>

1100
00:52:31,724 --> 00:52:34,034
<i>I still was hoping
to at least win one so</i>

1101
00:52:34,137 --> 00:52:36,448
<i>my kids could see that,
but I didn't.</i>

1102
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:38,068
<i>I lost the most important one
today,</i>

1103
00:52:38,172 --> 00:52:40,206
which is, uh, the one
where you get to decide,

1104
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,896
you know, who sits next to you
in the final three

1105
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
<i>and who has to go to fire.</i>

1106
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,172
<i>If I was in that position
and there was somebody</i>

1107
00:52:48,275 --> 00:52:50,206
who had played, like, my game,
especially with the last two

1108
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,689
<i>Tribal Councils, being so flashy
with the moves or whatever,</i>

1109
00:52:53,793 --> 00:52:55,586
<i>I'd throw them in fire
right away, so,</i>

1110
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:56,896
I'm going to fire.

1111
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,862
<i>This is all that matters.</i>

1112
00:53:01,965 --> 00:53:04,517
<i>I'm 100% locked in
on this fire-making challenge.</i>

1113
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,689
<i>This is, like, my one shot.</i>

1114
00:53:09,241 --> 00:53:10,620
<i>If I'm gonna make fire,</i>

1115
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:12,275
<i>I want to make it
against Cassidy because I think</i>

1116
00:53:12,379 --> 00:53:14,137
that's my best shot at winning.

1117
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:16,310
I think that...

1118
00:53:16,413 --> 00:53:18,000
I think that you should
make fire against me.

1119
00:53:18,103 --> 00:53:19,620
- Okay.
- Because

1120
00:53:19,724 --> 00:53:21,827
if I'm the biggest threat
in the game at this point,

1121
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:25,551
you could eliminate any doubts

1122
00:53:25,655 --> 00:53:28,482
- by beating me in fire... and...
- Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

1123
00:53:28,586 --> 00:53:30,413
I don't know how much weight
people actually hold

1124
00:53:30,517 --> 00:53:32,310
in the fire-making,
but it's a fair point.

1125
00:53:32,413 --> 00:53:36,206
<i>Jesse knows that I'm probably
the worst at fire, and he thinks</i>

1126
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:37,931
he can beat me more than he can
beat Gabler and Owen

1127
00:53:38,034 --> 00:53:39,689
and he's scared of that, and so
he's trying to convince me

1128
00:53:39,793 --> 00:53:41,551
<i>that the only way
that I'm gonna win the game</i>

1129
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:43,448
<i>is to go up next to him, but</i>

1130
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,275
no way in hell am I giving up
this necklace. I earned it.

1131
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,241
<i>JESSE:
I'm, like, one...</i>

1132
00:53:52,344 --> 00:53:54,482
I'm one challenge away.

1133
00:53:56,482 --> 00:53:59,241
There's one thing
standing in my way right now...

1134
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:03,482
...between me
and a million dollars,

1135
00:54:03,586 --> 00:54:05,689
between me
and, like, being able...

1136
00:54:07,931 --> 00:54:09,206
...between me and being able

1137
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,310
to give my kids,
like, that security...

1138
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,310
...that I never had, so...

1139
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:20,241
...I'm not gonna stop.

1140
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,551
<i>CASSIDY:
You want to talk?</i>

1141
00:54:22,655 --> 00:54:24,034
Yeah, sure.

1142
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:26,000
So what are you thinking?
It's your show.

1143
00:54:26,103 --> 00:54:28,241
Do you think
you could beat Jesse in fire?

1144
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:30,034
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- You really do?

1145
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:32,103
Can I see you make fire?

1146
00:54:32,206 --> 00:54:33,655
- Sure.
- Like, you know, like,

1147
00:54:33,758 --> 00:54:35,344
- watch you practice?
- Sure.

1148
00:54:35,448 --> 00:54:39,206
<i>I've been playing this game
out of the spotlight,</i>

1149
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,103
<i>so I think I need
a very public, big move.</i>

1150
00:54:42,206 --> 00:54:44,068
<i>And I want more than anything</i>

1151
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:45,758
to go make fire

1152
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:48,482
to win even more credibility
with the jury.

1153
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:50,758
- Now, fire's gonna go right in
there when I do it, all right?
- CASSIDY: Yup.

1154
00:54:50,862 --> 00:54:53,689
<i>GABLER:
But I'm running on pure heart</i>

1155
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:56,103
<i>with not a lot of food.</i>

1156
00:54:58,241 --> 00:55:00,724
Might just want
to start scraping a little more

1157
00:55:00,827 --> 00:55:02,517
- magnesium.
- Yeah.

1158
00:55:05,724 --> 00:55:07,896
<i>I am so hungry. I've lost
probably 20, 25 pounds.</i>

too fast, I get lightheaded.</i>

1160
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,068
My muscles burn all the time.

<i>GABLER: But I got to
pull it together tonight.</i>

1162
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:17,172
I got to do this.

<i>I need Cassidy</i>

1173
00:55:39,655 --> 00:55:41,793
<i>winning a million dollars
and being able</i>

1174
00:55:41,896 --> 00:55:43,827
to donate 100% of that prize

1175
00:55:43,931 --> 00:55:46,827
to a patient population
that I hold dear--

1176
00:55:46,931 --> 00:55:49,379
<i>Veterans in need--
so I have to win.</i>

1177
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:51,931
I'm gonna get it.
Let me get it here.

1178
00:55:52,034 --> 00:55:54,241
<i>CASSIDY:
I am trying to weigh,
between Owen and Gabler,</i>

1179
00:55:54,344 --> 00:55:56,103
<i>who do I think
has a better shot,</i>

1180
00:55:56,206 --> 00:55:58,758
not only of beating Jesse,

1181
00:55:58,862 --> 00:56:01,896
<i>but who do I think can beat him</i>

1182
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,379
<i>that also won't come back</i>

1183
00:56:03,482 --> 00:56:04,931
<i>with that boost
on the résumé that</i>

1184
00:56:05,034 --> 00:56:06,586
they needed to beat me.

1185
00:56:06,689 --> 00:56:09,068
<i>I think that Owen
has a potential</i>

1186
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:11,551
<i>to beat Jesse
in fire-making, but</i>

1187
00:56:11,655 --> 00:56:13,241
<i>if I put him in fire,
and he comes back</i>

1188
00:56:13,344 --> 00:56:15,172
<i>in this blaze of glory, like,</i>

1189
00:56:15,275 --> 00:56:16,896
<i>that might be the ammunition
that he needs</i>

1190
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,310
to steal the win from me.

1191
00:56:18,413 --> 00:56:19,931
<i>I'm nervous about Gabler</i>

1192
00:56:20,034 --> 00:56:21,965
<i>because he's been seeming
a little bit weak,</i>

1193
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:23,724
<i>a little feeble.</i>

1194
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:25,000
That makes me a little nervous

1195
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:26,551
<i>putting him up to Jesse.</i>

1196
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:28,379
<i>But I think that
if he did beat Jesse</i>

1197
00:56:28,482 --> 00:56:30,310
<i>that wouldn't be enough for him
to take the win from me.</i>

1198
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:31,793
I think I would still
beat him in the end.

1199
00:56:31,896 --> 00:56:33,310
<i>So that's why
it would be a better choice</i>

1200
00:56:33,413 --> 00:56:35,241
<i>to put Gabler up there.</i>

1201
00:56:35,344 --> 00:56:36,724
But can Gabler
actually beat Jesse?

1202
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:39,172
<i>That's the question.
Is he strong enough?</i>

1203
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:40,448
<i>GABLER:
I'm playing for</i>

1204
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:41,896
people out there
that are counting on me,

1205
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,448
<i>and tonight
I'm gonna have to do</i>

1206
00:56:43,551 --> 00:56:46,379
<i>something spectacular
to win this game.</i>

1207
00:56:46,482 --> 00:56:49,379
<i>OWEN:
I fought so hard
to make it this far,</i>

1208
00:56:49,482 --> 00:56:51,000

1209
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:54,379
<i>I need Cassidy to put me in fire
and win, and triumphantly</i>

1210
00:56:54,482 --> 00:56:55,586
go to the final three.

1211

<i>JESSE:
If I pull this off,</i>

1212
00:56:57,482 --> 00:56:59,103
I think I win the game.

00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:02,551
<i>I just think about my kids,
I just think about my wife.</i>

1214
00:57:02,655 --> 00:57:05,344
A lot riding on it.
A lot riding on it.

<i>CASSIDY:
This decision,

1216

00:57:11,965 --> 00:57:14,413
<i>But I won't know
if it's the right decision</i>

1218

♪ ♪

1220
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:57,310
PROBST:
All right. First question.

1221
00:57:57,413 --> 00:58:00,586
Cassidy, what's that feel like
to walk in knowing

1222
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,586
all the jury is looking
for who has the necklace?

1223
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:04,344
CASSIDY:
Yeah, I mean,
it's a pretty good feeling.

1224
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:09,310
You know, this was the paramount
win of the season. I think

1225
00:58:09,413 --> 00:58:12,310
this is the most monumental time
to have this

1226
00:58:12,413 --> 00:58:14,103
around your neck,
and to be the last person

1227
00:58:14,206 --> 00:58:15,862
to win this necklace
and for it to be my third win,

1228
00:58:15,965 --> 00:58:19,000
I mean, I'm super proud, and
I'm proud to wear it tonight.

1229
00:58:19,103 --> 00:58:21,137
And I feel like I earned
this spot in the final three.

1230
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:22,758
And that's-that's huge,
so, I feel great.

1231
00:58:22,862 --> 00:58:24,344
PROBST:
You have earned it.

1232
00:58:24,448 --> 00:58:26,551
You have three
individual immunity wins.

1233
00:58:26,655 --> 00:58:29,344
There were nine
individual immunity necklaces.

1234
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:31,793
You won a third of them,
Owen won another third.

1235
00:58:31,896 --> 00:58:33,931
- It's a dominating performance.
- Thank you.

1236
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:36,241
With your win today,

1237
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:38,931
you have a spot
in the final three where you get

1238
00:58:39,034 --> 00:58:42,448
to plead your case,
your story to your jury

1239
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:45,793
about why <i>you</i> played
the best game, you deserve

1240
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:48,344
the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars.

1241
00:58:48,448 --> 00:58:50,241
- But equally important...
- Yup.

1242
00:58:50,344 --> 00:58:53,413
...is the decision
you're about to make, which is,

1243
00:58:53,517 --> 00:58:55,586
who are you gonna take with you
and put in that second spot

1244
00:58:55,689 --> 00:58:58,379
and who are you going
to force to make fire?

1245
00:58:58,482 --> 00:59:01,034
So, before we get to that,
let's just talk about the day.

1246
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,827
Because you go back, and now

1247
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:04,034
you're the center of attention.

1248
00:59:04,137 --> 00:59:05,413
- Yeah.
- I'm assuming

1249
00:59:05,517 --> 00:59:07,068
everybody is pitching their way
around you.

1250
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:09,379
CASSIDY:
You know, of course,
everyone kind of lined up

1251
00:59:09,482 --> 00:59:11,517
to talk to me
and pitch and plead their case.

1252
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,517
And so, I mean,
this is definitely a burden

1253
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,931
I was carrying today. As happy
as I am to have the burden,

1254
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:18,689
this could make or break my game
depending on what I do tonight.

1255
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:21,724
Jesse, you made a pitch.
What was it?

1256
00:59:21,827 --> 00:59:24,620
Uh... [laughs]

1257
00:59:24,724 --> 00:59:27,034
I had a hard sell. [laughs]

1258
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:29,862
So my pitch to her was,

1259
00:59:29,965 --> 00:59:31,793
if you want to sort of,
like, guarantee a win,

1260
00:59:31,896 --> 00:59:34,724
if I'm that big of a threat,
then, like,

1261
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:36,758
you should sit
and make fire with me.

1262
00:59:36,862 --> 00:59:38,448
PROBST:
Cassidy, how was that received?

1263
00:59:38,551 --> 00:59:42,137
Uh, you know, to me, I think
that that is the kind of move

1264
00:59:42,241 --> 00:59:43,931
that somebody would make
if they feel like

1265
00:59:44,034 --> 00:59:46,482
they haven't really earned
their spot in the final three.

1266
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:48,689
But for me, I trust in a game
that I've played.

1267
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,896
I've played a strong game

1268
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,068
through and through
in every aspect.

1269
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,551
So for me to, like, risk that,

1270
00:59:54,655 --> 00:59:56,137
basically, is in
his best interest, not mine,

1271
00:59:56,241 --> 00:59:58,103
because he probably thinks
that he has the best chance

1272
00:59:58,206 --> 00:59:59,482
of beating me at fire.

1273
00:59:59,586 --> 01:00:01,206
PROBST:
Okay, so it sounds like

1274
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,586
Jesse's making fire,

1275
01:00:02,689 --> 01:00:04,655
and then it comes down
to the question of

1276
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:08,137
is he gonna make it
against Gabler or Owen?

1277
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:09,724
Gabler, what was your pitch?

1278
01:00:09,827 --> 01:00:12,034
Please let me make fire.

1279
01:00:12,137 --> 01:00:14,034
- I want to do it.
I want to-- If I get to
- You want to?

1280
01:00:14,137 --> 01:00:15,275
the final three,
I want to go into

1281
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:16,758
the final three
in a blaze of glory.

1282
01:00:16,862 --> 01:00:18,586
That was literally what I said.

1283
01:00:18,689 --> 01:00:21,517
Then I worked on some coconuts,
and I'm ready

1284
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,620
to rock it out
at one of these stations.

1285
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:25,551
Wow.
Owen, what was your pitch?

1286
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,482
Did you want to make fire?

1287
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:29,413
I would love to make fire, 100%.

1288
01:00:29,517 --> 01:00:32,310
I would love to. I would--
I would rather go out swinging.

1289
01:00:32,413 --> 01:00:34,034
So, of course, I would love

1290
01:00:34,137 --> 01:00:36,655
that opportunity
to seize this moment.

1291
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,137
It's really interesting
to me, Cassidy,

1292
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:40,827
because you basically have
three people

1293
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:42,586
are saying they want to make fire

1294
01:00:42,689 --> 01:00:44,827
when one of them could say,
"Hey, I'm good

1295
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:48,172
- just sliding into
that second seat."
- CASSIDY: Yeah. But to me,

1296
01:00:48,275 --> 01:00:50,172
this decision is not based off
of anything that they said.

1297
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,000
It's based off
what's best for my game,

1298
01:00:52,103 --> 01:00:54,241
what makes the most sense
for me tonight.

1299
01:00:54,344 --> 01:00:55,896
PROBST:
So you have a very clear

1300
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,379
point of view, and it's based on

1301
01:00:57,482 --> 01:00:59,586
what you think
is the best move for you,

1302
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,137
which is the only thing

1303
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,827
- you care about right now.
- Yeah.

1304
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:04,413
Who are the other two people
sitting next to you

1305
01:01:04,517 --> 01:01:05,965
and how do you convince

1306
01:01:06,068 --> 01:01:08,724
this group that you played
the best game of the three?

1307
01:01:08,827 --> 01:01:11,620
So, are you ready
to tell us your decision?

1308
01:01:11,724 --> 01:01:13,379
Yeah, I think I am.

1309
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:15,793
PROBST:
Let's start with
who are you going to take

1310
01:01:15,896 --> 01:01:18,551
and sit next to you
in that final-two spot?

1311
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:21,655
CASSIDY:
Tonight I am going to...

1312
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:23,137
take Owen to sit next to me.

1313
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:25,827
PROBST:
So, Owen, you are
in the final three.

1314
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:28,758
- Great.
- PROBST: You will have
a shot tomorrow

1315
01:01:28,862 --> 01:01:30,413
to plead your case

1316
01:01:30,517 --> 01:01:33,241
to the jury about
why your game is better

1317
01:01:33,344 --> 01:01:35,551
than the woman who just
brought you there: Cassidy.

1318
01:01:35,655 --> 01:01:38,137
The only thing left to decide
is fire-making now

1319
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:42,068
between Jesse and Gabler.

1320
01:01:42,172 --> 01:01:44,379
Anything either of you
want to say

1321
01:01:44,482 --> 01:01:46,241
before you head over
to your fire-making stations?

1322
01:01:46,344 --> 01:01:49,068
- How are you feeling
right now, Gabler?
- GABLER: I'm feeling good.

1323
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,689
I'm feeling good. You know,
I believe I can do this,

1324
01:01:51,793 --> 01:01:54,724
and I want to end my 25 days

1325
01:01:54,827 --> 01:01:55,965
with an exclamation mark,

1326
01:01:56,068 --> 01:01:58,000
and I can't think
of a better way to do it

1327
01:01:58,103 --> 01:02:00,551
than at one of
these stations tonight.

1328
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:02,724
- Jesse, how you feeling?
- JESSE: You know,
I've spent every

1329
01:02:02,827 --> 01:02:04,551
single minute since we got back
from the challenge

1330
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:07,344
up in the forest, making fire.

1331
01:02:07,448 --> 01:02:08,724
The only time they saw me today

1332
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:10,896
was when I was
collecting sticks.

1333
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,551
So I'm just gonna
do what I can, give it my all.

1334
01:02:14,655 --> 01:02:16,137
That's the best I can do.

1335
01:02:17,724 --> 01:02:19,137
Gabler, Jessie,
you can both take a spot

1336
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:20,172
at your fire-making station.

1337
01:02:20,275 --> 01:02:22,310
Good luck.

1338
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,103
PROBST:
All right.

1339
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:30,068
This is the only thing

1340
01:02:30,172 --> 01:02:31,413
you have to think about

1341
01:02:31,517 --> 01:02:33,413
right now in your life,

1342
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:34,655
is making what could be

1343
01:02:34,758 --> 01:02:37,551
a million-dollar fire.

1344
01:02:37,655 --> 01:02:39,862
I'm gonna give you a minute
to focus on that,

1345
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:41,862
and then we go.

1346
01:02:54,862 --> 01:02:57,689
All right, let's get to
our fire-making showdown.

1347
01:02:57,793 --> 01:03:00,551
You each have the same supplies.

1348
01:03:00,655 --> 01:03:03,620
Requirements for fire
are always the same.

1349
01:03:03,724 --> 01:03:06,896
Build a fire high enough
to burn through your rope

1350
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,862
and pop your flag.

1351
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:11,241
The first person to do that

1352
01:03:11,344 --> 01:03:13,551
takes the final spot.

1353
01:03:13,655 --> 01:03:16,241
The other person
will join the jury.

1354
01:03:16,344 --> 01:03:18,551
Could be a million-dollar fire.

1355
01:03:18,655 --> 01:03:21,275
- Are you both ready?
- Believe so.

1356
01:03:21,379 --> 01:03:24,000
Yes, sir.
Here we go. Begin.

1357
01:03:25,206 --> 01:03:28,827
This is it.
Day 25.

1358
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:33,000
The fastest fire's
ever been made

1359
01:03:33,103 --> 01:03:34,448
was just under five minutes.

1360
01:03:34,551 --> 01:03:36,482
Season 38.

1361
01:03:38,241 --> 01:03:41,172
Jesse said
he worked on his all day.

1362
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,551
Gabler sounds like he's had
a lifetime of making fires.

1363
01:03:47,827 --> 01:03:49,965
Jesse now gonna try to
get a little spark going.

1364
01:03:50,068 --> 01:03:51,586
He's got his flint.

1365
01:03:54,275 --> 01:03:55,551
Magnesium just helps it.

1366
01:03:55,655 --> 01:03:58,241
Gets you a little ignition
in there.

1367
01:03:58,344 --> 01:03:59,413
Ignite.

1368
01:03:59,517 --> 01:04:02,448
Both players prepping.

1369
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:04,172
Gabler's the first
to get flame.

1370
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:05,586
Good job, Gabler.

1371
01:04:08,379 --> 01:04:10,310
PROBST:
Jessie has flame.
Now you got to nurture it.

1372
01:04:14,413 --> 01:04:16,379
Both guys have flame.

1373
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,379
[whispering]: Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

1374
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,758
That hessian burns quickly
and it's impressive,

1375
01:04:22,862 --> 01:04:25,172
but it goes out just as fast.

1376
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:27,275
You're gonna have to actually
build a structure.

1377
01:04:29,275 --> 01:04:32,413
Jesse nurturing a little flame.
Gabler has

1378
01:04:32,517 --> 01:04:35,586
a much bigger flame.
A lot of that is still hessian.

1379
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,551
Gabler now adding sticks.

1380
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:42,448
That's what you need to catch
to start building

1381
01:04:42,551 --> 01:04:44,137
a bigger fire.

1382
01:04:44,241 --> 01:04:45,758
Jesse's flame is out.

1383
01:04:47,344 --> 01:04:48,586
PROBST:
He's gonna have to start again.

1384
01:04:48,689 --> 01:04:51,689
Gabler trying to nurture his
to keep it going.

1385
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:58,448
Jesse has played this
entire game slow and steady.

1386
01:04:58,551 --> 01:05:00,793
Never showed signs of panic.

1387
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:05,344
Gabler adding more sticks.

1388
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:08,103
He's got a decent fire going.

1389
01:05:11,689 --> 01:05:14,896
Will it burn high enough to
burn that rope is the question.

1390
01:05:17,517 --> 01:05:18,793
Jesse has flame again.

1391
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,344
PROBST:
Gabler in the Clear lead
right now

1392
01:05:22,448 --> 01:05:25,000
if that fire continues to grow.

1393
01:05:25,103 --> 01:05:26,689
Jesse now has got
a little something going.

1394
01:05:26,793 --> 01:05:29,000
He's in it.

1395
01:05:29,103 --> 01:05:30,793
Gabler adds
a little more hessian.

1396
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,103
PROBST: Starting to burn
that rope a little bit.

1397
01:05:34,206 --> 01:05:36,965
Jesse now trying
to get his fire going.

1398
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:39,689
He's gonna
have to build it quickly.

1399
01:05:39,793 --> 01:05:42,517
Gabler's is high and strong.

1400
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:47,793
- No...
- PROBST: Gabler's got

1401
01:05:47,896 --> 01:05:49,310
a high flame, fast.

1402
01:05:50,965 --> 01:05:52,241
Good job, Gabler.

1403
01:05:52,344 --> 01:05:53,931
- Thank you.
- PROBST: Fire is burning hotter

1404
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:55,413
and higher.

1405
01:05:58,827 --> 01:06:01,103
Jesse trying
to get back in this.

01:06:01,206 --> 01:06:03,586
Trying to get a flame going
that can get him in this.

1407
01:06:03,689 --> 01:06:06,172
It is Gabler's to win
right now.

1408
01:06:06,275 --> 01:06:08,172
Come on, baby.

1409
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:15,965

1410

Give me a hug.

And that is it for Jesse.

1414
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:28,172
Played a hell of a game.
Be proud of yourself.

and...

For them. Like... [sniffles]

1434
01:07:38,827 --> 01:07:40,724
Part of the reason
I came out here

1435
01:07:40,827 --> 01:07:43,275
was to set an example
for my kids, right? To show
them, like, you know,

1436
01:07:43,379 --> 01:07:46,310
you give it your all, like,
you fight as hard as you can.

1437

out there, right?

And, uh...

1439
01:07:52,724 --> 01:07:54,724
I feel like I did that.

1440
01:07:54,827 --> 01:07:58,000

we got to this, like,

01:07:58,103 --> 01:07:59,206
point where I could
plead my case

1442

for a million dollars, right?

1443
01:08:00,655 --> 01:08:02,517
And I felt like I played,
like, a great game.

1444
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,689
It was right there, and it--

1445
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:09,448
And it's hard because, like...

1446
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:11,482
I've had to fight,
like, my entire life

1447
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:13,344
to sort of, like,
get to where I'm at.

this tightrope because I don't
have a safety net back home.

- that really is
the biggest compliment

01:16:48,689 --> 01:16:51,965
Now you're at the last stage.
This is claim your victory.

1667
01:16:52,068 --> 01:16:53,724
If <i>Survivor</i> is a mountain,
this is you at the top

1668
01:16:53,827 --> 01:16:57,068
with your flag saying,
"This is my victory."

1669
01:16:57,172 --> 01:16:59,172
And if you don't
defend your game,

1670
01:16:59,275 --> 01:17:01,758
this jury will
flick you off that mountain,

1671
01:17:01,862 --> 01:17:03,137
send you tumbling down.

1672
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:05,896
That's their job.
Tonight, the power in the game

1673
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,931
shifts right there.
Eight people you had a hand

1674
01:17:09,034 --> 01:17:11,413
in voting out
will now determine your fate.

1675
01:17:11,517 --> 01:17:13,931
Your job
is to examine their game

1676
01:17:14,034 --> 01:17:16,655
by asking questions,
holding them accountable.

1677
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:19,965
With respect,
they did kick your ass.

1678
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:21,068
[snorts]

1679
01:17:21,172 --> 01:17:22,689
You're trying to determine

1680
01:17:22,793 --> 01:17:24,586
who you think's
deserving of your vote

1681
01:17:24,689 --> 01:17:26,655
for a million dollars.

1682
01:17:26,758 --> 01:17:29,275
I'm gonna give you a moment
to think of your questions,

1683
01:17:29,379 --> 01:17:32,551
I'm gonna give you a moment
to prepare for their questions,

1684
01:17:32,655 --> 01:17:34,241
and then we'll get started.

1685
01:17:46,965 --> 01:17:49,379
Okay, let's get into
our final Tribal Council.

1686
01:17:49,482 --> 01:17:52,172
We'll look at the game
in three big areas--

1687
01:17:52,275 --> 01:17:55,551
the social, the physical
and the strategic--

1688
01:17:55,655 --> 01:17:57,137
knowing that they all overlap.

1689
01:17:57,241 --> 01:17:59,379
And ultimately,
it is one big game.

1690
01:17:59,482 --> 01:18:00,965
But just so we have
some context,

1691
01:18:01,068 --> 01:18:03,310
- Jesse, get us started.
- JESSE: Yeah.

1692
01:18:03,413 --> 01:18:05,034
Um...

1693
01:18:05,137 --> 01:18:07,137
[chuckling]
Uh, I just want to say

1694
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:09,517
all three of you should
be proud of the games

1695
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,379
- that you played. Honestly.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

1696
01:18:11,482 --> 01:18:13,310
- JESSE: Like, you guys
did amazing. But, like,
- Thank you, Jesse.

1697
01:18:13,413 --> 01:18:14,586
this is not
the end of the game.

1698
01:18:14,689 --> 01:18:16,000
You have to earn our votes

1699
01:18:16,103 --> 01:18:18,310
- Yep.
- because this jury
has questions,

1700
01:18:18,413 --> 01:18:20,482
and they're gonna be tough
questions. And, as somebody

1701
01:18:20,586 --> 01:18:22,620
who went out in fire last night,

1702
01:18:22,724 --> 01:18:24,413
I was able to smell
the million dollars

1703
01:18:24,517 --> 01:18:27,103
right up until
I smelled the smoke

1704
01:18:27,206 --> 01:18:29,551
- of Gabler's blazing fire.
- [laughing]

1705
01:18:29,655 --> 01:18:32,137
JESSE:
So, you know, I know
how much pressure

1706
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:34,206
you must be feeling
right now, and so

1707
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,034
I want to see you go out
in a blaze of glory.

1708
01:18:36,137 --> 01:18:38,896
With that said, you guys
did amazing, and good luck.

1709
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,206
- Thank you.
- Thank you, my man.

1710
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,551
NOELLE:
So, I would like to start off

1711
01:18:41,655 --> 01:18:43,103
with the first question.

1712
01:18:43,206 --> 01:18:46,000
How would you differentiate
your game from the others?

1713
01:18:46,103 --> 01:18:49,103
- And we could start with Gabler.
- You know-- Thank you, Noelle.

1714
01:18:49,206 --> 01:18:52,724
So, my game has been
very much relationship-based

1715
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:55,137
and trust-based, being somebody

1716
01:18:55,241 --> 01:18:57,965
that can be counted on.
That's how I was playing.

1717
01:18:58,068 --> 01:18:59,758
And I'll tell you,
I've been in an alliance

1718
01:18:59,862 --> 01:19:02,793
with each and every
one of you guys at one point.

1719
01:19:02,896 --> 01:19:05,896
I was with the Coco crew.
I was with the Baka boys.

1720
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,310
And then, raise your hand

1721
01:19:07,413 --> 01:19:09,310
if you were in
the Ride or Die alliance.

1722
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:11,413
But I was never seen,

1723
01:19:11,517 --> 01:19:13,689
because I was talking
behind the scenes with

1724
01:19:13,793 --> 01:19:14,827
all the different alliances,

1725
01:19:14,931 --> 01:19:16,758
and I had multiple ways

1726
01:19:16,862 --> 01:19:18,310
to get deeper into the game.

1727
01:19:18,413 --> 01:19:19,931
Even when I was at ten,

1728
01:19:20,034 --> 01:19:21,517
I had a couple
of ways to get to seven.

1729
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:23,965
When I was at seven, I had
a couple of ways to get to five.

1730
01:19:24,068 --> 01:19:26,448
When I got to five,
I had two ways to get to three.

1731
01:19:26,551 --> 01:19:29,689
So, by being in these different
groups, it was very helpful.

1732
01:19:29,793 --> 01:19:31,275
And guess what?

1733
01:19:31,379 --> 01:19:33,241
26 days.

1734
01:19:33,344 --> 01:19:35,482
No one has
written my name down,

1735
01:19:35,586 --> 01:19:37,482
- Mm.
- Mm.
- not once.

1736
01:19:37,586 --> 01:19:39,344
I do want you
to write my name tonight.

1737
01:19:39,448 --> 01:19:41,034
- [laughing]
- GABLER: And I'm gonna

1738
01:19:41,137 --> 01:19:42,758
tell you more reasons why later,

1739
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:44,758
but for now,
I hope that answered

1740
01:19:44,862 --> 01:19:45,965
your question.
Thank you.

1741
01:19:46,068 --> 01:19:48,103
- PROBST: Cassidy.
- CASSIDY: Yeah. So,

1742
01:19:48,206 --> 01:19:50,724
for me, I feel like
I've always had

1743
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:52,275
my fingers on the pulse
of this game.

1744
01:19:52,379 --> 01:19:53,724
I always knew where
the votes were going.

1745
01:19:53,827 --> 01:19:56,862
Every vote that I cast,
it was the right vote.

1746
01:19:56,965 --> 01:19:59,965
Not one surprise or blindside
the entire game. And I think

1747
01:20:00,068 --> 01:20:01,724
the only other person
in this season who maybe

1748
01:20:01,827 --> 01:20:02,827
could say that is Jesse.

1749
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,172
But he's on the jury and I was

1750
01:20:04,275 --> 01:20:05,758
able to make it to the end here.

1751
01:20:05,862 --> 01:20:07,758
And I also had
really close bonds

1752
01:20:07,862 --> 01:20:10,275
with Karla and with James
on the Coco tribe,

1753
01:20:10,379 --> 01:20:12,758
which saved me through
those first couple votes.

1754
01:20:12,862 --> 01:20:14,862
And then, I knew
if I went to the end

1755
01:20:14,965 --> 01:20:16,758
with some of these people,
that they were gonna beat me.

1756
01:20:16,862 --> 01:20:18,793
So I had to form bonds
with, you know, with Gabler

1757
01:20:18,896 --> 01:20:20,551
and with Owen, who were left out
of a lot of the votes,

1758
01:20:20,655 --> 01:20:22,000
who were on the bottom.

1759
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:23,689
And then also, I know
that this is not personal,

1760
01:20:23,793 --> 01:20:26,068
and this was
nobody's intention, but

1761
01:20:26,172 --> 01:20:28,896
there was an historical number
of women voted out at pre-merge.

1762
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,551
Like, to be
the last woman standing,

1763
01:20:30,655 --> 01:20:32,103
I think,
is also a feat in itself.

1764
01:20:32,206 --> 01:20:34,724
And-and that's something
that I'll claim as well.

1765
01:20:34,827 --> 01:20:37,137
- Owen.
- Yes, sir.

1766
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:39,000
OWEN:
Well, y'all,
my <i>Survivor</i> story has been

1767
01:20:39,103 --> 01:20:40,379
one of the underdog.

1768
01:20:40,482 --> 01:20:43,586
I am a superfan,
I am a student of the game,

1769
01:20:43,689 --> 01:20:46,379
and I came out here thinking
I would play a brilliant game,

1770
01:20:46,482 --> 01:20:50,103
and that all came crashing down,
basically, in 24 hours.

1771
01:20:50,206 --> 01:20:53,310
On Baka, we were a disaster
from the beginning.

1772
01:20:53,413 --> 01:20:55,931
I got my name written down
on night three,

1773
01:20:56,034 --> 01:20:58,241
and I legitimately thought
I was gonna be the first boot,

1774
01:20:58,344 --> 01:21:00,275
and that my dream was gonna
come crumbling down.

1775
01:21:00,379 --> 01:21:05,206
We get to the merge, and things
just get even worse from there.

1776
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:08,655
I end up on the wrong side
of the Elie vote, and so,

1777
01:21:08,758 --> 01:21:12,068
I had to claw and scratch
and dig myself out of a hole

1778
01:21:12,172 --> 01:21:14,137
much deeper than either
of these folks were in.

1779
01:21:14,241 --> 01:21:16,310
And so, I saw one clear path,

1780
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,413
and that was
to sit with these two,

1781
01:21:18,517 --> 01:21:20,517
working with Jesse, to then

1782
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,344
take the power position
with some options.

1783
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:24,517
Was I perfect out here?

1784
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,827
Abso-fruit-ly not.
No way, no how.

1785
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:28,586
But I learned that
I don't need to be perfect.

1786
01:21:28,689 --> 01:21:30,620
I just need to be me.

1787
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:32,241
So if you respect an underdog,

1788
01:21:32,344 --> 01:21:34,413
if you respect determination,
hard work,

1789
01:21:34,517 --> 01:21:36,793
I think you should consider
giving me your vote tonight.

1790
01:21:36,896 --> 01:21:39,068
And I think that's how
I differentiate myself.

1791
01:21:39,172 --> 01:21:40,517
Thank you, guys.

1792
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,275
PROBST:
James.

1793
01:21:42,379 --> 01:21:45,931
Man, um,
I respect all three of you.

1794
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:50,034
Really good job.
Um, with that being said, Owen,

1795
01:21:50,137 --> 01:21:53,275
trust-wise, when did you
stick your neck on the line

1796
01:21:53,379 --> 01:21:55,068
for an ally to try to get them
to stay in this game?

1797
01:21:55,172 --> 01:21:56,620
NOELLE:
I would say

1798
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:58,965
when you trusted me to
steal your vote to get him out.

1799
01:21:59,068 --> 01:22:00,620
OWEN:
Yes, that was a big one.

1800
01:22:00,724 --> 01:22:02,620
That's when I knew I wanted
to trust you and work with you.

1801
01:22:02,724 --> 01:22:04,413
OWEN:
Yeah, that was a big day.

1802
01:22:04,517 --> 01:22:06,172
And since you brought it up,
Noelle, I'll mention that.

1803
01:22:06,275 --> 01:22:08,724
So, I viewed James and Karla

1804
01:22:08,827 --> 01:22:10,620
as the biggest threats
in the game,

1805
01:22:10,724 --> 01:22:13,275
and I saw this
golden opportunity for us

1806
01:22:13,379 --> 01:22:14,827
to lull them into
a false sense of security

1807
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:16,758
that I am going home.

1808
01:22:16,862 --> 01:22:18,724
Noelle will steal my vote,

1809
01:22:18,827 --> 01:22:20,448
and then they will not
play an idol,

1810
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:22,310
they will not play a Shot in
the Dark, and we are good to go.

1811
01:22:22,413 --> 01:22:24,379
And I had to trust in Noelle

1812
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:26,724
to pull that off
without bamboozling me.

1813
01:22:26,827 --> 01:22:29,172
The Gabes.

1814
01:22:29,275 --> 01:22:31,413
GABLER:
So, the Elie vote-- let's talk
about that for a second.

1815
01:22:31,517 --> 01:22:33,793
Elie had looked through my bag.

1816
01:22:33,896 --> 01:22:35,137
Also, it was Elie, but...
Yes, go ahead.

1817
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:36,758
Yeah. I-I... This is...

1818
01:22:36,862 --> 01:22:39,206
I'd... I'm... It's my time
to come clean, Gabler.

1819
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:41,172
- Yes, ma'am.
- Your instincts are spot on.

1820
01:22:41,275 --> 01:22:44,413
And I have to say, I'm so sorry.
I did go through your bag.

1821
01:22:44,517 --> 01:22:46,068
And you have killer instincts.

1822
01:22:46,172 --> 01:22:47,965
- You're a rock star. No worries.
- I just have to tell you that

1823
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:49,827
'cause that's been
eating away at me, and I just...

1824
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:53,068
- I really needed to finally
be honest with you.
- No problem.

1825
01:22:53,172 --> 01:22:55,724
- No problem. I totally get it.
I totally get it.
- All love.

1826
01:22:55,827 --> 01:22:57,862
So, I was... I was like, "Okay,
something's not right here."

1827
01:22:57,965 --> 01:23:01,034
And I stirred that pot.

1828
01:23:01,137 --> 01:23:03,758
Me and Elie even had
a very public argument in camp,

1829
01:23:03,862 --> 01:23:05,827
and we voted her out,

1830
01:23:05,931 --> 01:23:08,448
and then she flamed me in front
of the whole jury here.

1831
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:10,034
Like, "That's what you get
for trusting Gabler."

1832
01:23:10,137 --> 01:23:13,758
And I was like,
"I am way too high-profile here.

1833
01:23:13,862 --> 01:23:16,034
"Like an alligator,
I need to go underwater

1834
01:23:16,137 --> 01:23:17,931
and start playing
a different game."

1835
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,310
- Thank you.
- KARLA: Okay.

1836
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:23,344
So, Cassidy, can you give me

1837
01:23:23,448 --> 01:23:26,965
one specific move
that you did pre-merge

1838
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:29,482
to help propel you
into the merge?

1839
01:23:29,586 --> 01:23:32,137
CASSIDY:
Yeah. Um, I think
the most important move

1840
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:35,068
was building my relationship
with you and with James.

1841
01:23:35,172 --> 01:23:37,310
I trusted y'all
whenever the vote switched

1842
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:39,620
last-minute off of Geo
onto Lindsay, and then,

1843
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,172
through our relationship,
we were able to blindside Geo

1844
01:23:41,275 --> 01:23:43,724
and take control of-of kind of
the tribe in that way.

1845
01:23:43,827 --> 01:23:46,068
And so, that was the vote that
I made that helped propel me

1846
01:23:46,172 --> 01:23:48,896
and, you know,
our alliance into the merge.

1847
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,862
Thank you.

1848
01:23:50,965 --> 01:23:53,034
- Jesse.
- JESSE: Yeah, so,

1849
01:23:53,137 --> 01:23:54,793
I run surveys for a living,

1850
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,655
which is all about extracting
information from people.

1851
01:23:57,758 --> 01:24:01,793
Give me an example of when you
used your social relationships

1852
01:24:01,896 --> 01:24:03,448
to get information
in this game

1853
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:05,586
and how you used that
to get ahead.

1854
01:24:05,689 --> 01:24:08,655
GABLER:
So after the Elie takeout,

1855
01:24:08,758 --> 01:24:10,827
Alli-Gabler had
to go underwater...

1856
01:24:10,931 --> 01:24:13,758
- [laughing]
- Alli-Gabler.
- and-and hang out

1857
01:24:13,862 --> 01:24:15,482
by the water's edge
because you don't

1858
01:24:15,586 --> 01:24:17,689
just say,
"Oh, it's me. I'm the guy." No.

1859
01:24:17,793 --> 01:24:19,034
Even though it could have been

1860
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,758
Gabler in the library
with a coconut,

1861
01:24:20,862 --> 01:24:22,482
- I wanted it to be
a total secret, right?
- [laughter]

1862
01:24:22,586 --> 01:24:25,827
So, because of my social game
and the information

1863
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:27,620
I was getting, I was able

1864
01:24:27,724 --> 01:24:31,034
to get deeper in the game
with more options.

1865
01:24:31,137 --> 01:24:32,724
So, for me, I, like you,

1866
01:24:32,827 --> 01:24:36,206
had all of the right information
that I needed at every Tribal.

1867
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:37,965
I mean, I was in the trenches
in all of those votes.

1868
01:24:38,068 --> 01:24:39,448
I was talking to everybody.
I was making sure

1869
01:24:39,551 --> 01:24:42,310
that the plan that I was in on
was the right plan

1870
01:24:42,413 --> 01:24:43,931
for every single vote.

1871
01:24:44,034 --> 01:24:45,586
You know, also,

1872
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:48,034
I had a mental checklist of all
the people who had gunned for me

1873
01:24:48,137 --> 01:24:50,241
in this game. Ryan was trying
to blindside me.

1874
01:24:50,344 --> 01:24:52,172
And then, Noelle, I found out
you wrote my name down

1875
01:24:52,275 --> 01:24:54,103
at the merge.
You know, no hard feelings, but

1876
01:24:54,206 --> 01:24:55,931
same with Sami. He tried
to come after me at one point.

1877
01:24:56,034 --> 01:24:57,896
Cody threw my name out there
at one time, Karla as well.

1878
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,448
So all of these people,

1879
01:24:59,551 --> 01:25:01,448
I knew, if they were
gunning for me once,

1880
01:25:01,551 --> 01:25:03,379
they're probably gonna
try to get me out again.

1881
01:25:03,482 --> 01:25:04,586
And I have to get them out
of this game

1882
01:25:04,689 --> 01:25:06,103
before they can get me.

1883
01:25:06,206 --> 01:25:08,724
JEANINE:
I feel like I have
a great understanding

1884
01:25:08,827 --> 01:25:10,137
of Cass' core alliance
at this point,

1885
01:25:10,241 --> 01:25:13,862
but I'm really curious
as to, Gabler and Owen,

1886
01:25:13,965 --> 01:25:15,310
who you feel like
your closest allies were

1887
01:25:15,413 --> 01:25:17,310
and how you worked
with them post-merge.

1888
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:19,586
OWEN:
Sure. Um, Noelle and I had gone

1889
01:25:19,689 --> 01:25:21,965
on that journey together
on day seven.

1890
01:25:22,068 --> 01:25:24,034
It-it sounds corny, but
when I-I looked her in the eye

1891
01:25:24,137 --> 01:25:26,724
on that hike, I felt like we-we
kind of just got each other,

1892
01:25:26,827 --> 01:25:28,482
and I felt like
you were someone I could trust.

1893
01:25:28,586 --> 01:25:30,689
Eventually,
once Noelle was blindsided,

1894
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:33,103
I decided to make my bed
with these two, plus Jesse

1895
01:25:33,206 --> 01:25:34,862
and go to the final four
with them.

1896
01:25:38,793 --> 01:25:40,586
- Gabler?
- GABLER: My core alliance.

1897
01:25:40,689 --> 01:25:43,000
You know, honestly, I... Honestly,

1898
01:25:43,103 --> 01:25:45,379
I had a few of them.
I was in Ride or Die,

1899
01:25:45,482 --> 01:25:47,965
I was in with Sami
and I was in with Owen.

1900
01:25:48,068 --> 01:25:49,310
Although me and you went
in and out for a while,

1901
01:25:49,413 --> 01:25:51,137
and then we came together
post-merge,

1902
01:25:51,241 --> 01:25:52,793
and we were locked
the rest of the way.

1903
01:25:52,896 --> 01:25:56,724
Um, also, you know, I was in
with Ryan, Noelle, so...

1904
01:25:56,827 --> 01:25:58,551
- I-I got a question
for you, Gabler.
- Yes, sir.

1905
01:25:58,655 --> 01:26:02,413
You had decided to flip
and go with Jesse and Cody.

1906
01:26:02,517 --> 01:26:05,482
Was your intention
to go with these guys

1907
01:26:05,586 --> 01:26:07,896
for the rest of the way
or were you actually continuing

1908
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,931
to kind of go back and forth?

1909
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:12,275
I think that's something
that we would like to know.

1910
01:26:12,379 --> 01:26:15,413
I was in Ride or Die
to ride or die.

1911
01:26:15,517 --> 01:26:18,000
And, you know, that's having
trust and not being targeted.

1912
01:26:18,103 --> 01:26:20,241
I mean, just to think
back to day one,

1913
01:26:20,344 --> 01:26:22,724
to get all the way to here
and not get a vote? I mean,

1914
01:26:22,827 --> 01:26:24,620
- I... It's lucky, but it's a...
- That's very impressive.

1915
01:26:24,724 --> 01:26:26,206
CASSIDY:
Do you wonder
if part of the reason

1916
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:27,517
that you didn't get any votes is

1917
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:28,862
'cause people didn't
perceive you as a threat

1918
01:26:28,965 --> 01:26:30,482
or because, just because
you played it so well

1919
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:32,172
with all of your
different alliances?

1920
01:26:32,275 --> 01:26:33,551
GABLER:
I think it was both, because

1921
01:26:33,655 --> 01:26:36,241
if I stayed up top,
it wasn't gonna last.

1922
01:26:36,344 --> 01:26:37,586
NOELLE:
I mean, I think
you did an amazing job

1923
01:26:37,689 --> 01:26:38,931
of keeping me comfortable,
and that's why

1924
01:26:39,034 --> 01:26:40,517
I never wanted
to put your name out, so...

1925
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:42,137
- Thank you.
- JESSE: Yeah. You've come
to me and said,

1926
01:26:42,241 --> 01:26:44,827
like, "We're sort of playing
the silent, like, killers.

1927
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:46,793
"You know, like, we're sort of,
like, laying low,

1928
01:26:46,896 --> 01:26:48,620
and we're taking people out."

1929
01:26:48,724 --> 01:26:51,034
And you were doing that,
so, like, if people weren't

1930
01:26:51,137 --> 01:26:52,551
perceiving you as a threat,
that was your intention.

1931
01:26:52,655 --> 01:26:55,310
Thank you.
That was the game. Thank you.

1932
01:26:56,896 --> 01:26:58,172
How about the physical part
of the game?

1933
01:26:58,275 --> 01:27:01,172
RYAN:
Yeah. Um, so, a majority

1934
01:27:01,275 --> 01:27:03,068
of the immunities
that were won were won

1935
01:27:03,172 --> 01:27:04,586
by these three people
right here.

1936
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:06,517
A third of the immunities,
a third of the immunities,

1937
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,689
and a ninth of the immunities.

1938
01:27:07,793 --> 01:27:09,172
Only two weren't won
by you guys.

1939
01:27:09,275 --> 01:27:11,724
At what point in the game
did you feel like you needed

1940
01:27:11,827 --> 01:27:13,482
to manage
your physical threat level?

1941
01:27:13,586 --> 01:27:16,310
Like Gabler said,
Alli-Gabler had to go down

1942
01:27:16,413 --> 01:27:17,655
'cause if you're
too much of a threat,

1943
01:27:17,758 --> 01:27:19,172
you're getting kicked out.

1944
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:21,793
CASSIDY:
Yeah. I mean, I think,
for me, I honestly

1945
01:27:21,896 --> 01:27:24,413
didn't see myself becoming
a physical threat in this game

1946
01:27:24,517 --> 01:27:26,172
until, I, you know,
I won my first immunity.

1947
01:27:26,275 --> 01:27:27,724
And that gave me the boost
I needed to be able

1948
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:30,551
to win more immunities,
and I think the most important

1949
01:27:30,655 --> 01:27:33,551
win that I had
was that final win,

1950
01:27:33,655 --> 01:27:36,068
was that power to, you know,
decide who I wanted to take out,

1951
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:38,137
- the biggest threat
in the entire game.
- I have a question.

1952
01:27:38,241 --> 01:27:42,448
- Yeah.
- Um, I left out a little bit
about my occupation.

1953
01:27:42,551 --> 01:27:44,448
I am actually a Paralympian.

1954
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,034
I run track and field
for Team USA.

1955
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:48,758
- Wow.
- So, Cassidy,
I have to give it to you

1956
01:27:48,862 --> 01:27:50,413
for winning three
individual immunity challenges.

1957
01:27:50,517 --> 01:27:52,413
That is something
that you're gonna

1958
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:53,862
take with you
for the rest of your life.

1959
01:27:53,965 --> 01:27:55,862
It's a beautiful thing,
especially being a woman.

1960
01:27:55,965 --> 01:27:57,413
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

1961
01:27:57,517 --> 01:27:58,793
And now, with that being said,

1962
01:27:58,896 --> 01:28:00,448
you just mentioned
the fire-making challenge.

1963
01:28:00,551 --> 01:28:03,551
I would like to be walked
through your decision-making

1964
01:28:03,655 --> 01:28:05,551
on why you chose Gabler

1965
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:08,862
to make arguably
one of the biggest moves

1966
01:28:08,965 --> 01:28:10,896
in taking out one of the biggest
strategic players

1967
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,379
in this game,
and why you didn't want

1968
01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:14,137
to take that challenge on yourself.

1969
01:28:14,241 --> 01:28:15,862
CASSIDY:
Yeah. Honestly, the game

1970
01:28:15,965 --> 01:28:17,379
that I had played up
to that point was a good game.

1971
01:28:17,482 --> 01:28:18,827
You know, I didn't make
any big mistakes in this game.

1972
01:28:18,931 --> 01:28:20,344
You know, everything

1973
01:28:20,448 --> 01:28:22,517
that I did, I was always
on the right side of the votes.

1974
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:24,620
I was always in the
major alliance, and I worked

1975
01:28:24,724 --> 01:28:26,724
my ass off to be sitting here,

1976
01:28:26,827 --> 01:28:28,482
and I won that immunity
fair and square.

1977
01:28:28,586 --> 01:28:31,206
When the pressure was at its
highest, I showed up for that,

1978
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,620
and I ... defeated
that challenge,

1979
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,103
and I deserved to be here.

1980
01:28:34,206 --> 01:28:36,241
But I also felt like
it was a strategic decision

1981
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:39,758
in keeping Owen here
and not giving Owen the chance

1982
01:28:39,862 --> 01:28:41,241
to redeem himself in that way,

1983
01:28:41,344 --> 01:28:43,172
'cause he did have a little
bit of an underdog story.

1984
01:28:43,275 --> 01:28:44,551
And I felt like
if he made that fire,

1985
01:28:44,655 --> 01:28:46,034
that was gonna give him,
potentially, the boost

1986
01:28:46,137 --> 01:28:47,655
that he would need to, you know,
beat me in the end, and,

1987
01:28:47,758 --> 01:28:51,068
you know, also, even if Gabler
did win that fire challenge,

1988
01:28:51,172 --> 01:28:52,758
I didn't know
if it would be enough to,

1989
01:28:52,862 --> 01:28:54,034
you know, be able to beat me.

1990
01:28:54,137 --> 01:28:55,275
So that was also
a strategic decision,

1991
01:28:55,379 --> 01:28:56,586
and I felt like
he was the best at fire.

1992
01:28:56,689 --> 01:28:58,965
And so, that's why
I made that decision.

1993
01:28:59,068 --> 01:29:00,896
Perfect. Thank you.
Great answer.

1994
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,344
- Thank you.
- PROBST: Karla?

1995
01:29:02,448 --> 01:29:04,689
KARLA:
Yes. So, as you've seen,

1996
01:29:04,793 --> 01:29:07,620
I left it out there
physically and mentally,

1997
01:29:07,724 --> 01:29:10,413
and you saw me fighting till
I couldn't fight any longer.

1998
01:29:10,517 --> 01:29:12,551
- Yeah.
- Can you tell me a moment

1999
01:29:12,655 --> 01:29:15,758
where you have fought
until you couldn't any longer?

2000
01:29:15,862 --> 01:29:17,793
OWEN:
So, physically speaking,

2001
01:29:17,896 --> 01:29:20,172
obviously, last gasp.
We don't need to recount that.

2002
01:29:20,275 --> 01:29:21,586
But the-the main example for me

2003
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,275
is the final five
immunity challenge.

2004
01:29:23,379 --> 01:29:25,793
So, for those of you who don't
know, we got an advantage clue,

2005
01:29:25,896 --> 01:29:27,931
and we had
to do a word scramble,

2006
01:29:28,034 --> 01:29:30,034
and it said to sprint
to find the advantage.

2007
01:29:30,137 --> 01:29:33,275
I get to the correct tree,
and Karla snatches it literally

2008
01:29:33,379 --> 01:29:35,758
when my hand is right there,
and in that second,

2009
01:29:35,862 --> 01:29:37,241
that was probably the angriest

2010
01:29:37,344 --> 01:29:39,137
I have ever been
in my entire life.

2011
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:41,241
- [laughter]
- I screamed, I punched the tree,

2012
01:29:41,344 --> 01:29:42,827
I threw a rock into the ocean.

2013
01:29:42,931 --> 01:29:44,379
I blew this opportunity.

2014
01:29:44,482 --> 01:29:48,000
And so, I'm going in
feeling that I need to win.

2015
01:29:48,103 --> 01:29:51,068
And so, I ended up
winning immunity, my third one.

2016
01:29:51,172 --> 01:29:54,827
And it-it was so representative
of how my entire game has gone.

2017
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,379
To just be constantly
going up and down

2018
01:29:56,482 --> 01:29:58,344
and having the highs
of winning, having the lows

2019
01:29:58,448 --> 01:30:01,482
of getting blindsided, and just
emotionally, physically,

2020
01:30:01,586 --> 01:30:04,689
that was the-the one for me
that really meant a lot.

2021
01:30:04,793 --> 01:30:06,655
JAMES:
To follow up on that,

2022
01:30:06,758 --> 01:30:08,413
how do you feel like
you handled the low points

2023
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:10,517
in this game compared
to the high points in this game?

2024
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:13,862
Uh, not great.
I mean, one of my only regrets

2025
01:30:13,965 --> 01:30:16,137
is how you and I
went at it that day,

2026
01:30:16,241 --> 01:30:18,551
and mostly how I came at you
and how I reacted,

2027
01:30:18,655 --> 01:30:20,068
and I-I lost my cool that day.

2028
01:30:20,172 --> 01:30:23,310
But in contrast,
I think I tried to remain humble

2029
01:30:23,413 --> 01:30:25,068
when I did win immunities.

2030
01:30:25,172 --> 01:30:28,517
I tried to not gloat
if I pulled off a blindside.

2031
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,620
But that blow-up with you--
that is something

2032
01:30:30,724 --> 01:30:33,068
I'm ashamed of
and I wish hadn't happened.

2033
01:30:33,172 --> 01:30:35,517
KARLA:
So, we've heard a lot about

2034
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:37,517
the great things you've done,
but I want to know

2035
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:39,241
about your biggest mistake.

2036
01:30:39,344 --> 01:30:41,551
What did you do wrong,
and how do you own up to it?

2037
01:30:41,655 --> 01:30:43,310
GABLER:
I'm gonna go back to

2038
01:30:43,413 --> 01:30:45,137
when we lost
our immunity challenge,

2039
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:47,896
and I basically
huddled Baka together--

2040
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,896
right, Sami and Jeanine
and Owen-- and I was like,

2041
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,068
"Look, I blew
the challenge tonight.

2042
01:30:53,172 --> 01:30:54,413
"You know, you guys
can vote for me.

2043
01:30:54,517 --> 01:30:55,896
I'll play my Shot in the Dark."

2044
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,551
I mean, I...
It was clumsy.

2045
01:30:57,655 --> 01:30:59,206
That almost got me taken out.

2046
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:01,862
In this game,
to put yourself out there

2047
01:31:01,965 --> 01:31:04,551
is not a good idea.

2048
01:31:04,655 --> 01:31:07,068
- PROBST: Cassidy?
- CASSIDY: Yeah, honestly,

2049
01:31:07,172 --> 01:31:09,344
Karla, and especially since
this question's coming from you,

2050
01:31:09,448 --> 01:31:11,344
I think the biggest mistake
I made is about

2051
01:31:11,448 --> 01:31:15,000
the last conversations that
we had before we voted you out.

2052
01:31:15,103 --> 01:31:16,758
And I feel like I could have
approached that better

2053
01:31:16,862 --> 01:31:20,068
'cause we had such a good
relationship this entire time.

2054
01:31:20,172 --> 01:31:21,379
But you were that big
of a threat in my eyes,

2055
01:31:21,482 --> 01:31:23,551
and I knew that, like,
if I sat up here

2056
01:31:23,655 --> 01:31:25,241
next to you that
you were gonna beat me.

2057
01:31:25,344 --> 01:31:27,137
And-and I just wish

2058
01:31:27,241 --> 01:31:29,034
that I had handled
our last conversation better

2059
01:31:29,137 --> 01:31:31,448
because I-I think
you're such an amazing person.

2060
01:31:31,551 --> 01:31:32,517
And I'm not just
pandering to you.

2061
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,310
Like, I love you, I respect you,

2062
01:31:34,413 --> 01:31:36,310
and I just really regret the way

2063
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:38,689
that our last conversation went
and leaving things like that.

2064
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:41,482
- Thanks.
- Owen?

2065
01:31:41,586 --> 01:31:43,965
It's hard to choose
just one thing that I did wrong

2066
01:31:44,068 --> 01:31:45,965
since I had such a roller
coaster of a-of a ride.

2067
01:31:46,068 --> 01:31:47,965
But, um, in regards

2068
01:31:48,068 --> 01:31:50,620
to getting bamboozled
a few times, I don't regret

2069
01:31:50,724 --> 01:31:52,241
choosing the sides that I did

2070
01:31:52,344 --> 01:31:54,586
because they led me
on this journey.

2071
01:31:54,689 --> 01:31:56,172
And even if I don't win,

2072
01:31:56,275 --> 01:31:58,896
that growth and
that-that challenge to myself

2073
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,517
in the journey I've been on
over the past 26 days--

2074
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:03,620
it has been...
the adventure of a lifetime.

2075
01:32:03,724 --> 01:32:06,655
It's been so valuable to me
as a human being.

2076
01:32:06,758 --> 01:32:08,241
And I don't regret those at all,
but I do regret

2077
01:32:08,344 --> 01:32:10,413
a few conversations I had.

2078
01:32:12,172 --> 01:32:13,482
- Last question. Jesse, bring it.
- JESSE: All right.

2079
01:32:13,586 --> 01:32:15,896
Um, so, I've been honest
with everybody.

2080
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,827
You know, I have...
I got a PhD

2081
01:32:17,931 --> 01:32:19,586
about three weeks
before I got out here.

2082
01:32:19,689 --> 01:32:21,413
The thing I didn't really
tell everybody is

2083
01:32:21,517 --> 01:32:23,448
that the PhD is in
political science, which means

2084
01:32:23,551 --> 01:32:26,206
that I spent about six years
studying voting behavior,

2085
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:28,137
studying elections,
studying campaigns.

2086
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:30,103
And something
that's extremely important

2087
01:32:30,206 --> 01:32:32,000
in that is, like, persuasion.

2088
01:32:32,103 --> 01:32:34,827
And so I want to know
when you persuaded somebody

2089
01:32:34,931 --> 01:32:37,793
to vote the way you needed them
to vote and how you did it.

2090
01:32:37,896 --> 01:32:39,724
GABLER:
Um, okay, I'm gonna
go to the big vote,

2091
01:32:39,827 --> 01:32:42,310
post-merge, the first big vote,
the Elie vote.

2092
01:32:42,413 --> 01:32:44,068
I planted the seed

2093
01:32:44,172 --> 01:32:46,448
that she had looked through
somebody else's bag.

2094
01:32:46,551 --> 01:32:48,689
I pushed that
at our merge feast,

2095
01:32:48,793 --> 01:32:50,586
and I persuaded
each group to say,

2096
01:32:50,689 --> 01:32:53,206
"You know what?
I don't trust her.

2097
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:55,413
I don't know
if you should, either."

2098
01:32:55,517 --> 01:32:59,586
And bam, first one out,
post-merge.

2099
01:32:59,689 --> 01:33:02,137
- Cassidy?
- So, I would probably
go to the Ryan vote

2100
01:33:02,241 --> 01:33:04,758
because it was like my neck
was very clearly on the line.

2101
01:33:04,862 --> 01:33:06,758
And Ryan did have
relationships with Cody,

2102
01:33:06,862 --> 01:33:08,448
he did have a relationship
with Gabler.

2103
01:33:08,551 --> 01:33:11,586
But I was able to convince them
to take Ryan out instead of me.

2104
01:33:15,137 --> 01:33:16,827
Yeah, so...

2105
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:19,517
- Not-not to discredit you.
- CASSIDY: Okay. Well, I was

2106
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:22,068
under the impression
that I had... you know that, uh,

2107
01:33:22,172 --> 01:33:23,517
you guys were leaning more

2108
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:25,275
towards going with Ryan,
so that's what...

2109
01:33:25,379 --> 01:33:27,068
You were definitely
part of that,

2110
01:33:27,172 --> 01:33:28,827
- but that was from Ride or Die.
- JESSE: Yeah.

2111
01:33:28,931 --> 01:33:30,758
We came into Tribal--
me, Gabler, and Cody--

2112
01:33:30,862 --> 01:33:33,724
and we decided that if James
was gonna be on the jury,

2113
01:33:33,827 --> 01:33:37,137
we were gonna vote out Ryan.
If James wasn't on the jury,

2114
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:38,931
we were gonna take out you.

2115
01:33:39,034 --> 01:33:40,517
- That was the start
of the Ride or Die.
- That was the start

2116
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:41,862
of the Ride or Die. [laughs]

2117
01:33:41,965 --> 01:33:44,310
Well, damn. You got me.

2118
01:33:44,413 --> 01:33:45,689
PROBST:
Owen.

2119
01:33:45,793 --> 01:33:47,206
OWEN:
Yeah, I'm-I'm not gonna lie.

2120
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:49,241
I don't have one specific vote

2121
01:33:49,344 --> 01:33:51,724
where I was the driver
driving that vote.

2122
01:33:51,827 --> 01:33:53,482
I didn't have any advantages,
I didn't have idols.

2123
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:55,758
I voted wrong at the beginning,
and was put

2124
01:33:55,862 --> 01:33:58,034
into this minority position.

2125
01:33:58,137 --> 01:33:59,896
So I can't pretend
that I was here wheeling

2126
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,827
and dealing and making votes
happen and saying,

2127
01:34:01,931 --> 01:34:03,586
"Come on,
come with the Owen plan."

2128
01:34:03,689 --> 01:34:05,965
But I showed that
I had some strategic chops

2129
01:34:06,068 --> 01:34:08,931
and that I could be trusted
and that I could be a key part

2130
01:34:09,034 --> 01:34:10,655
of a lot of these votes.

2131
01:34:10,758 --> 01:34:13,758
I appreciate that answer, Owen,
truly do appreciate

2132
01:34:13,862 --> 01:34:16,137
that answer because it was
honest and it was humbling.

2133
01:34:16,241 --> 01:34:17,586
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.
- JAMES: Great job, guys.

2134
01:34:17,689 --> 01:34:19,551
- GABLER: Thank you, guys.
- Like, really good job.

2135
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:22,896
- Great job, y'all.
- All right, jury, a great
final Tribal Council.

2136
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,965
You held them accountable
when they needed it.

2137
01:34:25,068 --> 01:34:28,620
You lifted them up
when they deserved it,

2138
01:34:28,724 --> 01:34:30,344
and in the process,
you illuminated three

2139
01:34:30,448 --> 01:34:34,241
very different games
that all got them to the end.

2140
01:34:34,344 --> 01:34:35,827
The only question left now is

2141
01:34:35,931 --> 01:34:38,172
which game
you feel is most deserving

2142
01:34:38,275 --> 01:34:39,758
of the title of Sole Survivor

2143
01:34:39,862 --> 01:34:43,103
and the million dollars
that goes with your vote.

2144
01:34:43,206 --> 01:34:44,758
I'm gonna give you a minute

2145
01:34:44,862 --> 01:34:46,896
to take it all in
and then we will vote.
