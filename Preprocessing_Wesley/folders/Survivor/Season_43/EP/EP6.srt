1
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:12,206
<i>Guess what we got.</i>

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,965
- We have tree mail.
- Ooh.

3
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:17,000
- Yeah.
-<i>♪ Da, da, da, da.♪</i>

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,620
Whoa.

5
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:21,793
Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,448
- What? Read it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

7
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:32,344
Yes!

8
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,413
- What?!
- Yo!

9
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:36,310
I'm gonna wait. It's <i>Survivor.</i>

10
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:39,103
<i>While it's exciting,
"Yes, oh, my God,</i>

11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,517
<i>the merge is coming,"
it's</i> Survivor, <i>right?</i>

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,034
And for the last two seasons,

13
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:43,896
we've seen that
the merge doesn't come easy.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,413
There's a huge papaya
that I grabbed.

15
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:48,413
'Cause if we came in
with fruit and stuff,

16
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:50,137
they're gonna be like,
"Oh, my God.

17
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:52,137
- We like these people,
don't we?"
- Yeah.

18
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:54,793
<i>For me, honestly,
this is some perfect timing.</i>

19
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:56,344
<i>After yesterday's
Tribal Council, you know,</i>

20
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:57,931
<i>I felt left out.</i>

21
00:00:58,034 --> 00:01:00,413
And now I feel like I just
went from the top to bottom.

22
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:03,517
<i>So I'm not necessarily
tied down with Coco anymore.</i>

23
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,344
<i>I'm a free agent now.</i>

24
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:07,172
<i>I can say,
"Hey, I'm on the outs,</i>

25
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,482
and I'm ready to vote
for who you need taken out."

26
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:12,241
<i>So it's perfect time,
in my opinion.</i>

27
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:15,275
<i>Well, we made it to the merge.</i>

28
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:17,310
Wow, guys.

29
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:20,620
Let's go, team, 'cause you know
that clock has started already.

30
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:22,206
<i>The first phase of
the game, when it's all about</i>

31
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,793
<i>the tribes and stuff,
and you're in your little</i>

32
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:26,275
six-person tribe, to me,
that's like gladiator school.

33
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,034
Like, you know, just,
you're just learning the ropes.

34
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:29,413
<i>You're starting to learn how to</i>

35
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:30,448
<i>make the moves
and things like that.</i>

36
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:32,448
<i>And I'm, like, excited,</i>

37
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,344
<i>but I'm nervous, so, like, I got
this mix of feelings going on.</i>

38
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:36,931
But this is where you
got to really prove yourself.

39
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:38,551
This is where,
you know, it really gets going.

40
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,206
Yeah! Hello!

41
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:49,827
- BYOB! Where's the party at?!
- Huh?

42
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:58,482
<i>The game is starting.</i>

43
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,862
I am so excited. I've

44
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:02,482
<i>looked forward to this moment</i>

45
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:03,827
<i>since I was a little girl.</i>

46
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,034
I wanted to be able to say

47
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:07,379
<i>I made it to the merge.</i>

48
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:09,793
James. I'm Elie.
It's nice to meet you, James.

49
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,517
- Very nice to meet you.
- Oh, my God.

50
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,827
<i>We have been
competing against these tribes</i>

51
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:17,137
<i>and looking at them as our foes,</i>

52
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,758
<i>and now, all of a sudden,</i>

53
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:20,448
<i>everybody gets on the beach,
and we're like, "Hey!</i>

54
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:22,034
"Nice to meet you.

55
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:23,241
I've been waiting to meet you.
I can't wait to meet you."

56
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,000
And I'm going,
"Man, you all are lying."

57
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,241
<i>It's like Normandy here,
and it's about to hit the fan.</i>

58
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:29,827
So great to meet you, dude.

59
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:31,689
<i>I get it,
I mean, it makes sense,</i>

60
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,586
<i>but I find the whole thing
kind of comical.</i>

61
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,000
But, hey, if you can't beat 'em,
you might as well join 'em.

62
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,827
<i>I don't know
what to think, because</i>

63
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:51,310
I don't have a buff yet.
So it's not a traditional merge.

64
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:52,620
We don't have a merge feast.

65
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:54,137
So we know
something big is coming.

66
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,896
<i>It's great to be here.
I'm just scared</i>

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,862
to death at what's coming next.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,586
Yeah, no, it is huge.

69
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:11,758
- I was like... <i>
- I wish I had the chyron</i>

70
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:13,620
on the bottom third of my screen
right now

71
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:15,448
that could tell me
who's got an idol,

72
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:17,758
who's got an extra vote,
who's got an advantage,

73
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,586
'cause in this new era
of <i>Survivor,</i>

74
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:20,931
there are so many trinkets

75
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,000
<i>running around
in Jeff's bag of tricks.</i>

76
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:30,827
Okay.

77
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:33,586
<i>The known menu of advantages
we have right now,</i>

78
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:34,896
starting with Baka.

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,344
<i>Gabler has an idol</i>

80
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:38,310
<i>that is good
for one more Tribal Council.</i>

81
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:40,379
<i>Jeanine has
the hidden immunity idol</i>

82
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:42,172
<i>that she got
from the Beware Advantage,</i>

83
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:46,758
<i>but Jeanine can also not vote
at this first Tribal Council.</i>

84
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:48,896
Going over to Vesi,

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,137
<i>I know Jesse
does not have a vote,</i>

86
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:54,344
<i>and I know Noelle
has the Steal a Vote</i>

87
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:56,103
<i>from our journey together.</i>

88
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:59,551
<i>And then with Coco,
someone could have their idol.</i>

89
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,000
<i>That I don't know.</i>

90
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:03,724
<i>So as far as I know,</i>

91
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,896
I'm aware of two idols
and two no votes

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,517
<i>and a Steal a Vote.</i>

93
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,068
<i>So five different things
we're trying to keep track of</i>

94
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:13,965
right now,
on top of 12 other people.

95
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:16,206
So it's-it's a lot.

96
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,896
It's a big deal, you know,

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,379
even though
it's not really a merge.

98
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:21,551
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I'm so hyped.

99
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:23,551
You'll love Cody.
Like, you literally, like...

100
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:25,689
- He-he's... he's amazing.
- What you see out of him is,
like, what you get.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,620
<i>Noelle mentions Cody has
a bead from everybody's bag.</i>

102
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:45,000
<i>And my ears perk up.</i>

103
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:47,551
Cody's got the idol
from the Vesi camp.

104
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,655
So, Cody has the other idol.

105
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:54,517
Because Noelle was
talking about Cody had

106
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,689
- all the beads on all her bags.
- All the beads...

107
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:57,862
- But we know.
- We know.

108
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,068
And she-I don't think she knows.

109
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:00,793
- I don't think she knows either.
- So...

110
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:03,310
- Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah.
- Right?

111
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:05,137
- And that's, like,
a supermajority.
- Yeah.

112
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:07,344
- We at least know
where Vesi's idol is.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

113
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:09,931
<i>I feel like
I was made for</i> Survivor.

114
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:12,551
<i>I've kind of figured out
how to hack things</i>

115
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:14,000
<i>and, I don't know,</i>

116
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:15,551
<i>I just feel like this
is my environment.</i>

117
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:17,275
And the social element
of the game,

118
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,275
I knew I was gonna be good at,

119
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,448
but I'm way better
than I even thought.

120
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:22,896
<i>And honestly,</i>

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,793
<i>that's exactly where you
want to be at the merge.</i>

122
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:42,172
Come on in.

123
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,758
All right.
Shall we get into it?

124
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,689
- Yes, sir.
- All right,
first things first.

125
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:06,310
I'll take back the tribal idols.

126
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,137
Thank you.

127
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:13,103
No need for these anymore.

128
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,137
Oh, my God.

129
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,689
Because we're no longer
in the tribe stage of the game.

130
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:20,517
Yesterday, you received
a note with tree mail

131
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,275
telling you to drop your buffs.

132
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:24,896
You also don't have
your merge buffs yet,

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,344
because you have not
made the merge.

134
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:30,000
You're at the threshold where
you're trying to transition

135
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:33,000
from one stage of the game
to the next.

136
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:36,620
Here's what you're gonna
have to do to earn that buff.

137
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:38,275
For today's challenge,
we're gonna be divided

138
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:39,758
into two teams of six.

139
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:41,965
<i>On my go,
you're gonna race to remove</i>

140
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,689
<i>a heavy pile of debris
to reveal a sled.</i>

141
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:48,620
<i>You'll then drag that sled
to a series of stations,</i>

142
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:51,000
<i>collecting large wooden crates
along the way.</i>

143
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:54,758
<i>When you have all six crates,</i>

144
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:56,724
<i>you'll use them
to build a staircase.</i>

145
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,068
<i>Retrieve a ring of keys.</i>

146
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:05,172
<i>You must then work together
to get up a very steep ramp...</i>

147
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:10,172
<i>...to the finish where you will
solve a</i> Survivor <i>word puzzle.</i>

148
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,689
<i>First team to finish,</i>

149
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:16,689
all six players
safe tonight at Tribal Council.

150
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:19,965
You earn that merge buff
and, in addition, a merge meal.

151
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:23,137
- Whoo.
- It's yours, no twist,
no player gonna take it away.

152
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,379
Oh!

153
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:27,000
Losers, not the same story--

154
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:29,862
no buff, no food, no immunity.

155
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:33,034
Your threshold
will continue at Tribal Council,

156
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:34,965
where you will now
have to survive the vote

157
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,862
in order to make the merge.

158
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:38,655
And to be clear,
tonight at Tribal,

159
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,344
everybody goes.
Everybody's voting tonight.

160
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:42,379
Sound good?

161
00:07:42,482 --> 00:07:43,896
- Sounds good.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,344
All right, we're gonna
divide into two teams of six.

163
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:49,931
One final twist.
There's one extra person.

164
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:53,448
If you draw the gray rock,
you will not compete,

165
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:56,206
but you will choose
one team to align with

166
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,655
and ride or die with them.

167
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:00,310
You will win with them,
or you will lose,

168
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,137
but you will not
have any say in your fate.

169
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,310
- Make sense?
- Yes, sir.

170
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:06,896
- Shall we draw?
- Let's do it.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,517
All right, let's do it.

172
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,793
Grab a rock
and keep it a secret.

173
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,931
Oh, God.

174
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:20,793
<i>Sometimes the game comes down
to these moments of chance.</i>

175
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:23,862
<i>You're just
drawing a colored rock.</i>

176
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:27,103
All right, everybody,
turn your palms up...

177
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,448
...and reveal.

178
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,620
All right, everybody,
turn your palms up and reveal.

179
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:47,068
Oh. No way.

180
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:50,000
If you have a red rock,
go to the red mat.

181
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:51,620
If you have blue,
go to the blue.

182
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:54,206
Noelle, you have gray.

183
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,758
You're in the middle,
in between the two.

184
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,724
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

185
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:04,206
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

186
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:07,172
Oh, Noelle.

187
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,206
All right,
let's look at the Blue team.

188
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,275
We have Gabler, Jesse, Ryan,

189
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,103
Jeanine, Dwight and Karla.

190
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:15,793
Let's go to Red.

191
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:17,482
We have Cassidy, James,

192
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:21,241
Elie, Sami, Owen and Cody.

193
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:24,965
I got to say, from here,
it looks pretty even.

194
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:27,620
Yeah, my decision
sucks right now, Jeff.

195
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,068
All right, Noelle,

196
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,896
if you choose the team
that wins, you are safe.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,068
If you choose
the team that loses,

198
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:35,758
you go to Tribal tonight vulnerable,

199
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:37,551
and it could be you going home.

200
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:42,413
It's tough, because
it's so freaking even.

201
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:47,448
I'm gonna go with...
I'm gonna go with Blue.

202
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,827
All right, Noelle,
you're gonna sit right here.

203
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:51,413
You can see
everything from here.

204
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:53,724
Everybody else, I'm gonna
give you a minute to strategize,

205
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,517
and we will get it on.

206
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,827
Here we go.
Making the merge, right here.

207
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,000
<i>Here we go.</i>

208
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:09,379
For immunity, safety tonight
at Tribal Council,

209
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,551
earning the merge
and a merge meal.

210
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:12,758
Survivors ready?

211
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:16,379
Go!

212
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,758
First, you've got to get all
20 sandbags onto your platform.

213
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:22,620
That is stage one
of this challenge.

214
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:24,620
Here we go, Blue!

215
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:27,620
20 sandbags.

216
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:30,379
Red working
very quickly together.

217
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:33,586
Coconuts being tossed all over,
big heavy ropes,

218
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:36,137
but the sandbags
are what matter.

219
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:37,827
You got to get all of 'em.

220
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,310
- Let's keep moving!
- All right, now this side.

221
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:40,413
This side.

222
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:44,655
Blue very close.
Red very close.

223
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:47,137
- The last bag, is that it?
- That's it.

224
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:49,034
- You're good!
- Jeff.

225
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:50,758
- Pull it, pull it, pull it.
- Blue, you're good!

226
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:51,965
One, two, three.

227
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,379
We're dead even right now.

228
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:55,586
- Just here. Just to the nose.
- Here?

229
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,586
Now you got to get your sled
to that first station.

230
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,620
Let's go, guys.
Here we go, Blue.

231
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:04,827
Load those crates on your sled
and move on to the next station.

232
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:08,827
You got to cross a threshold--

233
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:10,862
- the theme of this challenge.
- Let's go, guys.

234
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:14,172
From one stage to the next.
Here comes Blue.

235
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,586
And here comes Red.
Let's go, Blue!

236
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:17,068
This way.

237
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:19,275
Nice. Nice.

238
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,103
- Blue in the lead.
- Nice job, Jesse.

239
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:22,965
They've got
three crates on the bottom,

240
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:25,000
- same as Red.
- Pass me the crates.

241
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:26,137
Here we go, guys.

242
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,517
- You got it?
- Yep.

243
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:30,689
Now they're gonna
get a little wobbly.

244
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:33,551
Oh, watch out.
Careful, careful.

245
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,206
- You got it?
- Go ahead.

246
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:38,137
- Now it's Blue.
- Oh, it's caught. It's caught.
- What's it caught on?

247
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,965
- On what?
- Blue is stuck,
and here comes Red.

248
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,482
This way, this way.

249
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,862
Well, we've got our first
lead change here.

250
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:48,103
It's now Red in the lead.
Blue's gonna have to wait.

251
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,172
- We could have a collision.
- Hurry. One, two, three.

252
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,172
You got to push.
You got to push.

253
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:53,724
One, two, three.

254
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:55,758
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

255
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:57,241
Stop.

256
00:11:57,344 --> 00:12:01,689
Red doing a great job to keep
the crates on their sled.

257
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:04,827
You're good.
Now start building a staircase.

258
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:07,862
You now have six crates
that you're gonna use

259
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:09,896
to build a puzzle staircase.

260
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,206
- Y'all got it?
- We got it, we got it...

261
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,448
You're good.

262
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,068
Now you
got to get the crates off.

263
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,241
Okay, that's gonna go on top.

264
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:18,862
We know that.

265
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:20,172
Where's the O-R in <i>Survivor?</i>

266
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,551
- Where's the O-R?
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

267
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,206
Karla got smashed
by one of the crates.

268
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,965
Where's the O-R?

269
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,310
- Oh, there's the "R."
- Okay.

270
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,413
Karla with an injured hand.

271
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,793
- You all right, Karla?
- You okay?

272
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,793
- All right.
- Karla bleeding.

273
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:38,551
You know you're on <i>Survivor</i>
when you got blood.

274
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:41,344
Red making progress
on that crate.

275
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:43,551
- We're good.
- You've got it. Go up.

276
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:45,310
Come on, come on...

277
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:47,862
Owen gonna go up
to untie the ring of keys.

278
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:51,103
It is now Blue
trying to stay in it.

279
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:56,689
Red's still in the lead.
Still a lot of challenge left.

280
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,241
Boy, Red is not messing around.

281
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:04,241
They don't want anybody
to see their puzzle.

282
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:07,310
- Now you got to get up the ramp. James...
- Okay, hold on.

283
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:10,793
- That was impressive.
James scaled the entire wall.
- Attaboy, James.

284
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:13,482
- Wait.
- Owen gonna give it a try.

285
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:16,620
Owen did it as well.
That is not easy to do.

286
00:13:16,724 --> 00:13:19,137
That is the biggest ramp
in <i>Survivor</i> history.

287
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:21,689
- All right. Ryan, get up there.
Ryan, get up there.
- Blue, you're good.

288
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:23,137
Ryan gonna head up.

289
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:24,689
Blue trying to close the gap.

290
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:26,448
Merge buffs on the line.

291
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:28,620
Immunity and Tribal Council
and a merge meal.

292
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,068
You're good, you're good.
Step on...

293
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:31,689
Elie now up for Red.

294
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:35,000
Cassidy standing
on the back of Cody.

295
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,758
- James has her.
- I got her. I got her.

296
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:40,344
- Probably a good idea.
- Here goes Blue.

297
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:42,241
- They've got their ring.
- Good job, Blue.

298
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:43,344
Here we go. Here we go.

299
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,620
Here goes Cody.

300
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,793
The last for Red.
Can he do it?

301
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:49,448
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- That is how you do it
on <i>Survivor.</i>

302
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:51,241
Let's go, baby!

303
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:52,724
Let's go. Let's go.

304
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,344
- Big lead for Red.
- Key, key, key.

305
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,758
Here goes Blue now
with a different story.

306
00:13:57,862 --> 00:13:59,448
- Gabler using his back.
- Come here.

307
00:13:59,551 --> 00:14:01,310
Ryan goes up on his own.

308
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:04,758
Here we go. Next, next, next.

309
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:08,000
Elie has the key. Crate open.

310
00:14:08,103 --> 00:14:10,413
- Let's go, baby.
- Last puzzle piece.
You are good. Start working.

311
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,655
It's gonna be Owen and Elie.

312
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:14,724
Grab with both hands.

313
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:15,896
Push him up.

314
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,862
Jesse trying to get up.

315
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:19,034
Gabler just pushes Jesse up.

316
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:20,758
- Same thing. Same thing.
Gabler and I will push you up.
- Ready?

317
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:22,862
Karla now gonna
have to go up for Blue.

318
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:25,000
She's gonna need a hand.
There's Ryan.

319
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:29,448
Karla has had a hard
time in this challenge.

320
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:32,275
- No, no, no. Go, go, go.
- She's
had her hand smashed.

321
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,655
- She just slid down the wall.
- All right, I'm coming.

322
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:39,137
Red has been in the lead
from the beginning, really.

323
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:41,931
Noelle put all her faith
on Blue.

324
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:43,241
Six people wearing Blue.

325
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:46,413
Jeanine is up.
Get over that wall.

326
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,413
Jeanine's good.
Here comes Karla.

327
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:49,931
Come on, Karla!

328
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,344
She's getting a hand.
Look at that.

329
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:54,379
- Ryan upside down...
- Grab my feet. Grab my feet.

330
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:55,758
like Spider-Man.

331
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,034
Hold on. Let me grab your...

332
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:58,931
Will it work?

333
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:00,103
Yes, Karla.

334
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:01,862
- You got it!
- Give me your hand.

335
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,620
- Karla digging, digging.
- Get up here...

336
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:04,931
Grab her hand, Dwight!

337
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:06,137
I got it, I got it, I got it.

338
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,689
I'm going. Okay.

339
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:09,620
- You're up, Karla.
- Yes, yes, yes.

340
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,241
- I got it.
- Go ahead. I got it, I got it...

341
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,551
It is now
Blue trying to catch up.

342
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:15,689
- Karla bleeding, in pain.
- Yeah, yeah.

343
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:18,620
Here we go, everyone. Great job!

344
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:21,068
There you go.
Now get that piece free.

345
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:23,172
Now you can
start working on it, Jeanine.

346
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,586
- Okay.
- It's Dwight and Jeanine
for Blue.

347
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:29,241
It is Elie and Owen for Red.
And a mass of letters.

348
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:32,517
You are trying to solve
the <i>Survivor</i> word phrase.

349
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,068
Get rid of that,
and put this one up there first.

350
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:36,862
Red has had more time
to study the puzzle.

351
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:38,068
First.

352
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,655
Okay.
You think it's three lines?

353
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:41,344
- Yeah, I do. I do.
- Okay, cool.

354
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:43,896
Dwight gonna make a move now.

355
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,275
They've got an idea.

356
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,965
No, hey, this-this one
goes right on the bottom.

357
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:49,827
- It's gonna say "S."
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

358
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:51,482
James with a lot of thoughts

359
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:53,310
about where
these letters should go.

360
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:58,551
- Yeah.
- Another piece by Blue.

361
00:15:58,655 --> 00:15:59,896
Do they think
they have something?

362
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,724
- There you are.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

363
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,137
Red now with another piece.

364
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:04,862
Elie and Owen think
they have something going.

365
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,931
Shut up. Shut up.

366
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:10,827
Both teams are now whispering.

367
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:12,965
Both teams think
they know what it is.

368
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:15,068
They just got to
figure out how to do it.

369
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,931
Another piece for Owen and Elie,
and another piece

370
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:20,068
- for Dwight and Jeanine.
- Right there.

371
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:23,620
- No, that's too high...
- Both teams appear
to have the very same thought

372
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:26,965
- in mind for the phrase.
Now who will solve it first?
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

373
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,241
No, no, this one goes...
This one. It's this one...

374
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:30,931
Panic now.
Jeanine racing to get a piece.

375
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:33,137
Owen trying
to hold a piece up.

376
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,172
They need a different piece.
Which one is it?

377
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:37,241
- Owen, Owen, all right...
- Immunity on the line.

378
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:40,310
Guaranteed spot in the final 12.

379
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,137
- Dwight with another piece.
- Help her, help her...

380
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:45,103
Here goes Jeanine and Dwight
with another piece for Blue.

381
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:46,620
Blue trying to close the gap.

382
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:48,310
E, E, E, E, E.

383
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:49,793
Both teams know they have it.

384
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:52,413
They've just got to get
their puzzle put together.

385
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:54,655
It is Blue now
with the momentum.

386
00:16:54,758 --> 00:16:56,586
- That one, that one, that one.
- This one, this one, this one.

387
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:58,482
Blue is now in the lead.

388
00:16:58,586 --> 00:16:59,724
You got it.
Don't worry about it.

389
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:01,000
Elie trying to shove a piece in.

390
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,965
- Hey, Elie, no.
- That's not it. That's...

391
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:05,172
Blue with another piece.

392
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,724
They're down to two pieces.

393
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:10,310
This would be
a big comeback for Blue.

394
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:11,896
Say it! Say it!

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,206
"Earning your spot
at every stage."

396
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,827
That's what you just did.

397
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:19,103
You earned
your spot in the merge.

398
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,344
Nobody from this six going home.
Noelle is safe.

399
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:24,551
- We're not going home.
- Noelle picked
the right group

400
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,620
and she is safe tonight as well.

401
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:28,241
Thanks for believing in us.

402
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:31,931
Come here. Come join us.

403
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,655
Share those happy tears.

404
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:35,793
Wow.

405
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,482
Sorry, bro.

406
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:40,965
...

407
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:42,724
Thank you guys so much.

408
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:43,862
All right.

409
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:47,413
Six buffs in here,
and one for you.

410
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,862
Oh, my God, they're so pretty.

411
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:52,000
My daughter's gonna love this.

412
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:54,965
Jesse, Dwight, Jeanine, Ryan,

413
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:58,172
Karla, Gabler and Noelle,
safe tonight

414
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:02,000
at Tribal Council, cannot
be voted out of this game.

415
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:05,586
In addition, you'll return
to camp and enjoy a merge meal.

416
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,482
You six will not have any food,
you don't have a buff,

417
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:11,793
but what you do have
is a lot of uncertainty.

418
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:14,241
Which one of you is
going to be voted out tonight?

419
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,965
Grab your stuff, head out.

420
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:17,413
See you tonight at
Tribal Council, where somebody

421
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:20,586
will be the sixth person
voted out of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

422
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:23,517
<i>The winner's got immunity
at tonight's Tribal Council.</i>

423
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,413
They are set.
The rest of the six of us,

424
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:29,689
<i>somebody's dream
of being a part of the merge</i>

425
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:32,965
<i>is going to end one night short.</i>

426
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:35,344
The craziness, the madness
has not even started yet.

427
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,172
It's about to get
really wild around here.

428
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:54,206
<i>I mean, whatever tonight,</i>

429
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,482
- we ran that thing hard.
- We sure did.

430
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:59,413
All righty, y'all. Let's
have a little losers' lunch.

431
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:00,793
Oh, so, I'll get the fire
going, and...

432
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:04,758
No, no, no, no, no, don't.

433
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:06,689
- We were all in it together.
- No, we were all,
we were all there.

434
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:10,103
I know, I just,
I couldn't focus, and I'm sorry.

435
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:11,724
<i>We were licking
our wounds a little bit.</i>

436
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:12,965
<i>I volunteered</i>

437
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,068
to be on the puzzle,

438
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:17,482
<i>and so I feel responsible.</i>

439
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:18,758
Let's push through it.

440
00:19:18,862 --> 00:19:20,827
Let's make the most
of what we can.

441
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:22,275
- Get some little sticks. <i>
- Right now,
we're kind of in "mergatory."</i>

442
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:25,172
<i>Half of us
have not made the merge.</i>

443
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:26,862
You know, the six of us
are in limbo right now.

444
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,344
<i>We're fighting
to stay in the game.</i>

445
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:31,068
<i>So it's me,
it's Elie, it's Cody,</i>

446
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:32,655
<i>it's Sami,
it's Owen and it's James.</i>

447
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:34,206
<i>And one of us is going home.</i>

448
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,586
- One, two, three.
- Team Red.

449
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,793
So, like, there's nowhere
to hide right now.

450
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,793
Cody, can I just
talk to you for one sec?

451
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:50,793
I'll tell you what,
James is sketching me out.

452
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:53,034
- Yeah.
- The fact that James was like,

453
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:54,344
-"Cody, let me talk to you,"
like that.
- I know.

454
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:57,310
So I want to talk
with Cody at some point,

455
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,827
-'cause I would like
for him to be the name.
- Mm-hmm.

456
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,000
Like, I think that we... Yeah.

457
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:05,758
- Like, we tell Coco
that it's gonna be Cody.
- Cody.

458
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:09,827
As fast as we can.

459
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,103
<i>I've been getting the best vibes</i>

460
00:20:11,206 --> 00:20:13,310
from people on the Vesi tribe.

461
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,000
<i>They seem
to want to work with us,</i>

462
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:16,827
<i>really for
the past few challenges.</i>

463
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:17,896
Elie. Elie.

464
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,413
Have him switch that over here.

465
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,413
Vesi is very clearly
helping Baka.

466
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,068
<i>So I think
they would be comfortable</i>

467
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,689
<i>with a Coco going home first,</i>

468
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:29,620
<i>where we do a split
on Cassidy and James.</i>

469
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:33,724
<i>And so, I'm gonna tell them
that I'm open to a Cody vote,</i>

470
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:36,344
<i>but the real plan
is to vote out one of them.</i>

471
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:39,551
<i>I'm just gonna have
to lie about it to their face.</i>

472
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,241
- Yes.
- Okay.

473
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,931
- And I'm with James.
- Okay.

474
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:48,862
So I don't want to throw
anybody's name out there,

475
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,241
- but I'm just saying, like...
- Get Cody?

476
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:52,310
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.
What do you think?

477
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:54,241
- I'm okay with that. Yeah. Yeah.
- That's...
I'm totally okay with that.

478
00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:55,241
<i>There's a lot riding</i>

479
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:57,206
on tonight for me, and I'm

480
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,482
<i>- definitely nervous.</i>
- I've made

481
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:59,620
a better connection with James

482
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:01,000
- than I have with Cody.
- Yeah.

483
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:02,241
- So far. <i>
- Me and Elie</i>

484
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,965
talked about voting together.

485
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:05,931
<i>And I feel like us girls
could kind of get together</i>

486
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,172
<i>and maybe do something.</i>

487
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,241
<i>Unfortunately,
that means it's Cody tonight.</i>

488
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:16,206
I think that we're down
to team up with Coco,

489
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,448
-'cause that's an easy majority.
- So you just tell me

490
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:21,241
<i>the name so I know where to go.</i>

491
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:23,310
<i>I mean, we don't have
to beat around the bush.</i>

492
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:26,172
- I would like to work with Coco.
- Okay.

493
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:28,724
And so that means
you and Cassidy are safe.

494
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:30,551
I don't
want to vote out a Baka,

495
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,724
and that means
Owen and Sami are safe.

496
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:34,310
- Okay.
- Not gonna vote for myself.

497
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:36,068
<i>- Yeah...
- Okay.</i>

498
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:37,724
- Uh, yeah.
- You don't have
to say anything else.

499
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:40,310
<i>I pulled Elie aside
to see where she wanted to go.</i>

500
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:41,793
She didn't want
to give me a name,

501
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,793
and then she reluctantly
gave me Cody's name.

502
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:48,344
<i>I want to keep her very
confident, but I'm not with her.</i>

503
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:50,103
<i>She doesn't
tell me anything, and</i>

504
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:51,344
I don't trust her.

505
00:21:58,137 --> 00:22:00,586
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

506
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:01,862
Ah, how do you start?

507
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:03,275
<i>I haven't eaten for</i>

508
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:04,724
13 days.
I haven't eaten a real meal,

509
00:22:04,827 --> 00:22:06,310
so I'm gonna enjoy this.

510
00:22:06,413 --> 00:22:07,793
The hell is this?

511
00:22:07,896 --> 00:22:09,241
<i>And I don't even</i>

512
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:11,034
know what I'm putting
in my mouth at this point.

513
00:22:11,137 --> 00:22:12,655
<i>I don't even know
what the tastes are.</i>

514
00:22:12,758 --> 00:22:14,482
<i>I'm just trying to stuff it
as much as possible.</i>

515
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,517
<i>So sorry.
Manners out the door.</i>

516
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,517
I'm so sorry, Nana.
I'm so sorry, my mom.

517
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,517
My mom loves dragon fruit.

518
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,137
Does anyone want a beer?

519
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,689
- Would that be crazy?
- Yeah, I'll have a beer.

520
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:27,068
- Who wants a beer?
- I'd like a beer.

521
00:22:27,172 --> 00:22:28,724
- Here, darling.
- Thank you.

522
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,896
<i>We're having a great time
because we're safe.</i>

523
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,862
That means that we don't have to
come back to camp and scramble.

524
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:36,586
- <i>
- But at the same time,</i>

525
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,206
<i>there's, like,
this tension of like,</i>

526
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,758
"All right, let's talk."

527
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,413
- Oh, my God. Uh...
- Oh.

528
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:44,827
So, tonight.

529
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,172
Yeah, let's, like... What's...

530
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:47,551
- What's the scoop?
- What's the plan?

531
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:49,068
We could be the final seven.

532
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:53,965
That's the thing.
We could be the final seven.

533
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:55,724
We have the numbers.
We got this spot

534
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:57,379
by winning today.

535
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:00,275
<i>Ryan starts
talking about how it makes sense</i>

536
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,413
<i>that the seven of us are strong,</i>

537
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:04,551
and I'm not
interested in his pitch.

538
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:06,034
<i>It's just a little ridiculous,</i>

539
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:07,965
<i>the fact that we're just gonna</i>

540
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:10,172
become an alliance because
you boosted me up a ladder.

541
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:12,344
<i>I have my own
alliance at this point.</i>

542
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,793
So we need
to find somebody that,

543
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:16,586
you know, would help us
get further in the game.

544
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:19,827
Yeah. I mean, I do have
a good relationship with Cody.

545
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,275
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

546
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,620
- I'd like to keep Cody.
- I'd love to keep Cody.

547
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:25,724
I'd like to keep Owen and Sami.

548
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:27,068
I'd like to keep Elie.

549
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:29,793
<i>It was pretty evident that</i>

550
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:31,655
<i>everyone wanted
everyone to stay,</i>

551
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,965
with the exception of Gabler.

552
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:36,172
Elie went through my bag
on day three.

553
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,482
So that's something for me
that I remember.

554
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,689
<i>I was just like,</i>

555
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:44,965
"Uh," and then
I took a sip of my beer,

556
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,655
because this
is one of those moments

557
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,827
<i>where you're just like,
"Oh," you know?</i>

558
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:51,931
<i>It is very evident
that Baka is fractured.</i>

559
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,206
<i>Gabler. Oh, my God.
In that moment,</i>

560
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,827
my jaw drops, because I am just

561
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:01,896
<i>flabbergasted that he would
just throw her under the bus</i>

562
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,896
<i>like that. And it's wild to me
what comes out</i>

563
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,896
of that man's mouth, especially
in front of me, who...

564
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,448
He knows it's gonna
get back to her.

565
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:10,655
It's gonna be pretty tough
for all of us to vote unanimous.

566
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:12,586
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

567
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:15,241
<i>Everybody was fractured,
they need something to go for.</i>

568
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:16,793
<i>And by throwing out</i>

569
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,758
Elie's name, I was trying to...
throw out Elie's name.

570
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:23,413
<i>The trust has been broken with
me and Elie since day three.</i>

571
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:26,689
<i>So right now,
I'm targeting enemies</i>

572
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:29,206
<i>that I know are enemies
that are plotting against me.</i>

573
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,689
<i>And if I can
do that with people,</i>

574
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:36,000
<i>then we build a little bit
more trust together, because</i>

575
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:37,586
if we're gonna vote Elie out,
it's today.

576
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:40,586
<i>I want to look like
I'm decisive and trustworthy.</i>

577
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,896
<i>I think it's
really important for me</i>

578
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,724
<i>to not just talk to talk
but walk the walk.</i>

579
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:46,586
And I'm walking
that walk tonight.

580
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,068
Oh, God.

581
00:25:10,137 --> 00:25:11,310
- No. No.
- No.

582
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,275
<i>Okay.</i>

583
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,000
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

584
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:25,000
<i>It sounds like Coco
is putting me on the block.</i>

585
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:29,206
<i>I am the only Vesi member that's
not immune at Tribal Council.</i>

586
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,413
So it's easy for them
to just be like,

587
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:31,862
"Well, let's
just pick off Cody."

588
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:35,103
<i>Fortunately,
Baka wants to work with Vesi</i>

589
00:25:35,206 --> 00:25:36,448
<i>to take out James.</i>

590
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:38,103
<i>And if that's the case,</i>

591
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:40,172
<i>then I don't need
to play my idol tonight.</i>

592
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:47,689
<i>- Yeah.
- Why me?</i>

593
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,862
I know, you didn't.

594
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,689
<i>It seems
that at the merge feast,</i>

595
00:25:56,793 --> 00:25:59,241
<i>Gabler told everybody there
that on day three,</i>

596
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:03,275
I searched his bag,
and he essentially serves me up

597
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:06,758
on a silver platter of somebody
that he would like to vote out.

598
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:10,689
<i>I have heard that
you're telling people</i>

599
00:26:10,793 --> 00:26:12,413
I searched your bag
on day three,

600
00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:15,137
and I have literally
never searched your bag.

601
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,517
I have no idea
where you got that information.

602
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,103
Owen and Sami said they saw you.

603
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:21,137
They told me that you looked
through my bag with Jeanine.

604
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:22,413
Well, it's not true.

605
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:24,172
Why would you
throw me under the bus?

606
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:26,068
You've been throwing me
under the bus, too.

607
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:28,965
I have not.
That's the thing, Gabler.

608
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:30,931
- I'm not playing like that.
- Somebody went through my bag.

609
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:33,241
- I still felt...
- Was it Jeanine? Who was it?

610
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,482
- Somebody did it.
- I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not like that.

611
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:37,379
It's important
for you to do that.

612
00:26:37,482 --> 00:26:39,137
- I'm not like that.
- Okay.

613
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:41,000
- Then I-I got to assume
that you guys were together.
- So...

614
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:42,689
Of course.
Jeanine is my best friend.

615
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:44,275
Does Jeanine
have a hidden immunity idol?

616
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:45,793
- Did she find something?
- Yeah.

617
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,206
Yeah, but nobody told me, right?

618
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,689
Why would I tell you
someone else's business?

619
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:50,931
I'm not gonna
tell your business...

620
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:52,137
Am I your ally
or am I not your ally?

621
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:55,034
I feel you have turned on me.

622
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:56,379
All right, well, it's not true.

623
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,344
We wanted to stay Baka strong.

624
00:26:58,448 --> 00:26:59,931
- I have not faltered.
- Then you should have
shared information with me

625
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:01,655
when you could have, and brought
me in and kept me in the loop.

626
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:03,517
- So...
- Well, I have
to go talk to other people

627
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,241
- I know. I know.
- because you have now put me

628
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,448
on the chopping block, and
I have to deal with that, so...

629
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:10,000
- I don't know that it was me.
- It was you.

630
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:13,413
<i>We talked in circles,
and there was no budging.</i>

631
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:15,068
He's not believing me at all.

632
00:27:15,172 --> 00:27:18,206
<i>So Owen and Sami
really screwed me over.</i>

633
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,000
You told Gabler that I
searched his bag, and I did not.

634
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:22,551
And then he told
everybody at the feast

635
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:24,068
that I was searching his bag.

636
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:26,137
He got my name.
He said from you and from Owen.

637
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:29,068
- What? You-you...
- He told my name to everybody

638
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:30,862
- at the merge feast
to vote for me.
- Yeah.

639
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,206
<i>What the hell?</i>

640
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,827
<i>Gabler blew everything up.</i>

641
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:36,448
<i>Now Elie is suspicious of me.
And she has enough skill</i>

642
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:39,241
in this game to turn it
right back around on me.

643
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:41,758
<i>So we got
to make her feel comfortable.</i>

644
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:43,965
The two of you told Gabler
that I searched his bag.

645
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:46,724
<i>- I, first of all,
I did not search his bag.
- I didn't tell him.</i>

646
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:48,896
- Does Gabler want to vote for
you? Or is he just trying...
- Yeah. Yeah.

647
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,379
<i>Gabler threw Elie
under the bus.</i>

648
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:53,586
<i>And now she is panicking</i>

649
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,172
that she is gonna get voted for
by basically everyone

650
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,655
for being a snake.

651
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:59,344
I don't know
what he's talking about.

652
00:27:59,448 --> 00:28:00,965
I think he's just scared of you.
I don't know what it is.

653
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:03,068
Then I-I need you to help me
clear my name then.

654
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:04,724
- Yes...
- Like, if y'all are legit.

655
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:05,931
- We got it.
- I trust you both, and...

656
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:07,413
Who do you want to vote for?

657
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:10,172
- Okay.
- I want to get out there
and talk to people,

658
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:11,655
because I feel like
the longer it festers,

659
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,241
- I'm just not...
- No, let's get out there.

660
00:28:13,344 --> 00:28:14,689
- not trying to have, like...
- Okay, and whatever you do,

661
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,517
whatever you hear,
keep coming back to us, please.

662
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,965
<i>James would be a really
easy target to get rid of,</i>

663
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:28,034
<i>but Elie is so much more
of a threat to have around here.</i>

664
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:31,758
So I think
Elie has to go tonight.

665
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:37,517
So, you and Elie are sisters,

666
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,793
- and I get that, but...
- Yeah.

667
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:41,482
...somebody went through my bag.
I know it.

668
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,724
I also know that you guys found

669
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:46,862
the hidden immunity idol
out here.

670
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:50,206
- Actually, is it okay if we,
maybe, just talk?
- Yeah, yeah...

671
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,241
- Is that okay?
- I don't mind. I won't
disclose any information now.

672
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:54,068
- We'll see you in a minute.
- Thank you so much.

673
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:56,931
<i>Coming back to camp,
all hell broke loose.</i>

674
00:28:57,034 --> 00:29:00,103
Gabler goes off his rocker

675
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,793
<i>and keeps
throwing Elie under the bus</i>

676
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:04,034
<i>and starts telling
everyone that I have an idol.</i>

677
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:05,379
<i>I honestly don't know</i>

678
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,379
how this information
got out at this point.

679
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,310
I don't even care
to deal with it right now.

680
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:11,896
All I care about
is that people feel good

681
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,655
within the Baka five
enough to just vote together.

682
00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:17,310
I think for this vote, guys,
we got to stay Baka strong.

683
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:19,103
- I agree. Please.
- We have to.
We have to.

684
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:21,827
We'd be so, so, so, so dumb
to implode right now.

685
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,517
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yeah.

686
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,000
<i>The problem is I don't know that
I can work in the game with her.</i>

687
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:30,310
That's fair, but we just got
to make it to the next step.

688
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:31,724
Me and Sami need our buffs.

689
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:33,965
- We can settle this later.
- Okay.

690
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:35,724
<i>My main question is
is Gabler with us?</i>

691
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:38,068
<i>And I think he understood
where I was coming from.</i>

692
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:39,931
So hopefully
he'll stick true to his word,

693
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:41,448
<i>and we will vote together.</i>

694
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:43,448
Maybe just tone it down
a little bit,

695
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:45,310
<i>-'cause Jeanine's got an idol.
- I know.</i>

696
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:46,724
- She could play it for Elie.
- Yes.

697
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,172
So you got to keep things cool.

698
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:51,379
- That's all I'm saying.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Got you. Got you.

699
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,206
<i>Yeah. I'm freaking down.</i>

700
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,689
- I don't want to scramble.
- Yeah.

701
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:00,517
I want to trust, you know,
in the things

702
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,517
- that I talk about and say
and call it a day.
- Yeah. Yeah.

703
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,517
<i>Elie is still
saying Cody's name,</i>

704
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,689
<i>but I feel
something sketchy is up.</i>

705
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:11,310
So I need to talk to everybody

706
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:12,620
to see
where everybody's head at.

707
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:21,620
Yeah.

708
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,206
<i>According to James,</i>

709
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,620
<i>Elie put Cody's name
on the chopping block.</i>

710
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:28,310
<i>It seems like Elie's out here
trying to, like,</i>

711
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:30,689
make moves, and, like, you know,

712
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:32,896
<i>cause discord and spread
a little bit of misinformation,</i>

713
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,206
<i>from what I can tell.
And so</i>

714
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,586
Elie's name, you know,
was already out there by Gabler.

715
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:39,758
<i>And so I think
that's the way to go.</i>

716
00:30:43,862 --> 00:30:46,551
- Elie's the one...
- Elie's the one that's doing it.

717
00:30:46,655 --> 00:30:49,724
<i>And I think that we need
to break up Elie and Jeanine.</i>

718
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:51,103
<i>- And...
- Yeah.
I agree with that.</i>

719
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:53,689
- What's up, bro?
- What's up, buddy?

720
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:04,448
Elie.

721
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:05,655
All right.

722
00:31:14,793 --> 00:31:16,965
<i>- Okay.
- If we can get Gabler,
we have the numbers</i>

723
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:19,241
- to get Cody out.
- Gabler's not gonna
vote that way, though.

724
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,310
- You don't think?
- No. Gabler wants Elie out.

725
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:22,586
He may give it to me.

726
00:31:24,689 --> 00:31:25,827
Frickin' Elie and Jeanine,

727
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:27,689
guess whose names
they're throwing out.

728
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:28,689
- Who?
- Who?

729
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:30,206
- You two.
- Shut up.

730
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,586
I swear to God.

731
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,206
<i>Damn.</i>

732
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,793
<i>Elie was targeting Cody,
and now she's coming after me.</i>

733
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,482
<i>I knew that I couldn't
trust her, but then</i>

734
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:40,655
a lot of people
don't trust her,

735
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:42,413
<i>and that's good for me.</i>

736
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:46,655
So it's important
that Baka votes James.

737
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,724
<i>Everyone in Baka
is voting James.</i>

738
00:31:48,827 --> 00:31:50,275
- James?
- Yeah.

739
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,034
- Can we do this? Now's the time.
- Yeah.

740
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:54,758
No, I understand.
I understand.

741
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:57,344
<i>Jeanine is really scrambling</i>

742
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,206
<i>to try to get me on board,
but it's too little, too late.</i>

743
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,482
<i>We're still not</i>

744
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,965
Baka strong.
We're a Baka ... show.

745
00:32:04,068 --> 00:32:06,482
<i>These people think
that they've got me fooled,</i>

746
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:09,103
<i>but I know what's going on here.</i>

747
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:10,517
<i>I'm being played.</i>

748
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,172
<i>So I'm gonna vote Elie tonight,
and that's it.</i>

749
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:20,448
- He just came to me, he said...
- Why would I ever trust him?

750
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:21,758
I'm gonna go home.

751
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:29,034
- Okay?
- Okay.

752
00:32:29,137 --> 00:32:30,034
- I'm down.
- No, I know.

753
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:31,965
I'm the one without any power.

754
00:32:32,068 --> 00:32:35,068
<i>I thought I was in a position
where I could call the shots,</i>

755
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:37,206
<i>but now I think
I might be going home.</i>

756
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,344
<i>Fortunately, Jeanine might be
willing to play her idol for me.</i>

757
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,310
<i>Either way, it's gonna be
a real trial for me tonight,</i>

758
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:45,586
<i>and I don't want Gabler</i>

759
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:48,068
to be the person
that crafts my exit out.

760
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,206
Wow. A lot of people.

761
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,827
A lot of people.

762
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:27,482
All right, so, big day.

763
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:29,827
The result
is seven people are safe.

764
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:33,620
Six people still
have to get to the merge.

765
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:36,448
So, Gabler, what happened
when the seven of you showed up

766
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:39,172
and now we have 13 people
all back together in camp?

767
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:41,551
We started off
at the merge meal.

768
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:43,310
There was a little bit
of talk of strategy,

769
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:46,931
and then we leisurely
walked back in, and boom,

770
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:48,310
everything just exploded.

771
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:50,344
I thought
I was gonna go lay down

772
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:52,586
and just try
to digest for an hour...

773
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:54,862
...and I have
not stopped talking all day.

774
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:56,413
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, Jeff. It's gonna be

775
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:58,724
very interesting
this evening, I think.

776
00:33:58,827 --> 00:34:00,379
Cody, how'd you see it?

777
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:02,344
Oh, it was nutso.
It was complete chaos.

778
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:04,034
There was, there was
no organized chaos going on.

779
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:06,275
- It was a dust storm.
- Really?

780
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:07,827
Absolutely crazy.

781
00:34:07,931 --> 00:34:11,103
- It was almost nauseating. Man.
- It was a lot.

782
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:13,379
So, Sami, tonight
there are essentially

783
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:15,758
seven people
who have individual immunity.

784
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,206
What are you feeling?

785
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,793
Because you're one of the six
that's in trouble.

786
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,896
Honestly, as soon as
we lost the challenge,

787
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,724
all I could think about
was how scary it is

788
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:27,551
to be vulnerable
versus being safe.

789
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:30,000
It gets to the point where
every conversation that

790
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:31,862
you have with somebody, every
look that you give somebody,

791
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:33,206
it really matters,

792
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,931
because it gets back to you,
at some point.

793
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,758
- Cassidy,
you were nodding.
- Yeah, it's true.

794
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:39,517
And it's hard to know
what dynamics

795
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,482
are going to shift
when you bring

796
00:34:41,586 --> 00:34:43,103
a certain group of people
together, you know?

797
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,068
And anything that anybody
tells you could be a lie,

798
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:48,586
it could be the truth, and it's
really hard to differentiate.

799
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:50,620
So it can form bonds,

800
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:53,517
but it can also
cause chaos, too.

801
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,758
Jeanine, how is this vote
different now that

802
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:59,344
we are into the individual
portion of the game?

803
00:34:59,448 --> 00:35:01,931
It could not be more different
than a-a tribe vote.

804
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:04,793
Like, we're all trying
to gauge not only what is best

805
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:07,655
for our individual game,
but what is every other

806
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:10,034
individual thinking
is best for their game.

807
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:12,689
And that's just, I don't even
know what factorial that is,

808
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:15,310
but 13 to the 12th?

809
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,724
Like, that just, there's
so many permutations of people

810
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:20,172
working together
and thinking different things.

811
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:22,827
Elie, Jeanine just hit
on something so important,

812
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:26,172
which is you have to look
at the game from every single

813
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:28,793
person's point of view,
and it gets very complicated.

814
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,310
Yeah. Everybody's
got their own mission.

815
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,379
Everybody's got their
own goals and their checklist.

816
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:34,827
And so today was no different.

817
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:37,482
I was thrown a little bit,
because, all of a sudden,

818
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:40,551
my name had at least, you know,
had-had bubbled to the surface.

819
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:44,137
And in that moment, I'm like,
"Oh, this is <i>Survivor?</i>

820
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:47,689
Like, what have I been playing?"
And so I felt really panicked.

821
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:50,172
And spending a lot of time
with somebody who doesn't

822
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:52,689
see me as an asset,
that's a wasted five minutes.

823
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:55,206
And in this game,
five minutes could be your life.

824
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,793
Wow. So, Owen,

825
00:35:56,896 --> 00:35:59,620
is it that tight
that you really have to decide

826
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,586
where you're gonna
spend your time?

827
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:04,379
Right. Trust is the only
currency we have out here,

828
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:06,137
and that's
the beauty of <i>Survivor</i>

829
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:08,758
is that you can
never trust anyone 100%.

830
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:10,206
We can only trust ourselves

831
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,103
in trying to figure out
who trusts me.

832
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:15,310
Do I trust them?
And, like, all the possibilities

833
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:17,758
that come after that,
it makes your head spin.

834
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:20,310
So it was, uh, it was
an exhilarating afternoon.

835
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:23,965
So, Karla, there had
to be talk of advantages,

836
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:25,931
idols, Shot in the Dark,
all the things

837
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:29,310
that could change
or blow this Tribal up.

838
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:30,724
Of course. Right. You...

839
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:33,000
Not only do you have
a combination of alliances

840
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,448
or just
people working together,

841
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:37,793
but there's been nine people
on journeys already.

842
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,344
You don't know what people
have and what's out there.

843
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:44,000
And so that adds
another element of stress.

844
00:36:44,103 --> 00:36:46,931
And, Gabler,
when you have an advantage

845
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:49,379
or an idol,
you don't want to play it

846
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:51,896
if you don't have to,
'cause you want to save it.

847
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,413
Absolutely, Jeff.
That is riding the razor's edge.

848
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:56,655
You know, the people
that have idols or advantages

849
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,344
in their pockets,
playing them at the right time

850
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:00,310
is the masterful piece
of <i>Survivor.</i>

851
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:01,758
And if you play 'em wrong,

852
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:03,655
you've got bad jewelry
to go home with.

853
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:06,551
So, Sami,
it sounds like there were

854
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:08,068
at least some discussions
where people said,

855
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,344
"So-and-so might have this,"

856
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:11,448
or "So-and-so has this"
or "I have this."

857
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:13,241
- Were you a part of that?
- Yeah, and I think

858
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,793
one of the more
important things is, like,

859
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:17,172
the way that those advantages
and idols are played,

860
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:18,827
whether they're played
the right way or not,

861
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:22,517
can change the way that people
view an alliance, you know?

862
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,413
If you said you had somebody's
back and they went on ahead

863
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,724
and played an advantage
or an idol or something,

864
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:30,172
what does that tell you
as a person in a group?

865
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:31,379
That tells you
they didn't really

866
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,482
come in here trusting you.

867
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,862
James, couldn't have said it
better than what Sami just said,

868
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,448
and yet,
it doesn't solve anything,

869
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:41,034
because if
you think you got to play it,

870
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:43,551
you got to play it, because
you got to get to tomorrow.

871
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:46,137
For me, I'm just like,
"Hey, I trust the people that

872
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:49,241
I've talked to,
and it makes pragmatic sense."

873
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:51,448
The vote I'm gonna make tonight,

874
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:53,379
just trying
to not flunk kindergarten, Jeff,

875
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:55,275
and move forward.

876
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:58,103
Jeanine, if you look at what
Sami's saying a different way,

877
00:37:58,206 --> 00:38:01,379
he might really be saying
that sometimes a big move

878
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:03,517
is to not make the big move.

879
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,172
If you're right,
it can lock you like this.

880
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:09,448
If you're wrong, your torch
is here and you're gone.

881
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:13,413
This is a game
of paranoia versus gut.

882
00:38:13,517 --> 00:38:16,034
And the difference
is paranoia is very present,

883
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:19,206
and gut is the ability
to latch on to things

884
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,034
that are behind you that

885
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:23,931
you can look back on and say,
"My gut instinct is that

886
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:25,379
that relationship
in the past worked,"

887
00:38:25,482 --> 00:38:27,137
or, you know,
"I can trust that person."

888
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:30,517
And it's not just
so caught up in the momentary

889
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,862
feeling of what you should
be doing right then and there.

890
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,034
All right, time to vote.
Jeanine, you're up.

891
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,310
If anybody has
an advantage or an idol

892
00:39:37,413 --> 00:39:40,517
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

893
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,241
All right, I'll read the votes.

894
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:03,034
First vote, Elie.

895
00:40:06,482 --> 00:40:07,517
James.

896
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:11,103
Owen.

897
00:40:14,103 --> 00:40:16,068
Cassidy.

898
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:17,862
One vote Elie, one vote Owen,

899
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:19,551
one vote James,
one vote Cassidy.

900
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:21,482
DWIGHT [whispering]:
Geez, what a crazy game.

901
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:25,206
James.
That's two votes James.

902
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:32,206
Elie. We're tied.

903
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,000
Two votes Elie,
two votes James,

904
00:40:34,103 --> 00:40:36,103
one vote Owen,
one vote Cassidy.

905
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:40,620
Elie.
That's three votes Elie.

906
00:40:42,793 --> 00:40:45,482
Elie. That's four votes Elie,
two votes James,

907
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:48,068
one vote Owen, one vote Cassidy.

908
00:40:51,862 --> 00:40:53,137
Sixth person voted out

909
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:54,689
of <i>Survivor 43...</i> Elie.

910
00:40:54,793 --> 00:40:57,551
- Dang.
- You need
to bring me your torch.

911
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:01,275
- All right.
- Be safe.

912
00:41:01,379 --> 00:41:02,586
Love you, Elie.

913
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:04,000
- Sorry.
- Bye.
- You're good, bro.

914
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,758
Y'all see what
trusting Gabler will get you?

915
00:41:10,862 --> 00:41:12,275
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

916
00:41:12,379 --> 00:41:14,206
Right back at you.

917
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,655
Elie, the tribe has spoken.

918
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:20,896
Thanks, Jeff.

919
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:24,965
- Time for you to go.
- Thanks.

920
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:34,862
Congratulations.
You have all now made the merge.

921
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,448
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

922
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:44,827
- Good night.
And the game continues.
- Thanks, Jeff.

927
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:14,482
An alarm bell's going off
for me, like, "Oh, my God."

928
00:42:14,586 --> 00:42:17,068
None of us know what to do.
What's happening?

929
00:42:18,344 --> 00:42:19,862
What do you mean,
"He found something"?

930
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:21,758
"Alli-Gabler" came up to the
surface. I'm ready to strike.

931
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,551
<i>They got me. I think
it was a good move on them.</i>

932
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:29,137
<i>I had a lot more game to play.</i>

933

playing a little too hard,</i>

have any hard feelings.</i>

937

00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:40,034

939
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:42,827
<i>I will never ever
forget the people that I met.</i>

940
00:42:42,931 --> 00:42:44,655
And it was
the best time of my life.
