1
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:11,689
We still have
a fire going, guys.

2
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:12,827
We still have a fire.

3
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:13,965
And we had
a successful blindside today.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,241
I shook his hand, and he gave me
his word, and he played me.

5
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:19,793
And am I right, Drea?

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,862
He was thinking
he's untouchable.

7
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:24,655
He's, like, giving me marching orders... Yeah.

8
00:00:26,172 --> 00:00:27,172
<i>
Wait. Can you hear it?</i>

9
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:28,517
Can you hear that?

10
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:30,206
You know what that is?

11
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,724
That's Hai's head
rolling down the road

12
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:33,034
because we lopped his head off,

13
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:35,034
<i>just like he deserved.</i>

14
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,482
<i>Because Hai was playing</i> <i>
too many different games</i>

15
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:38,793
<i>and got too full of himself.</i>

16
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:40,862
Final seven.
Final seven.

17
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:42,482
Congratulations, everybody. Yeah.

18
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:44,413
Hai thought he was the king, but</i>

19
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,137
his peasants banded together

20
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:49,034
<i>and set into motion the biggest</i> <i>
blindside of the season.</i>

21
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:50,655
<i>And quite frankly,</i> <i>
I've orchestrated</i>

22
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:51,965
right from the beginning.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,551
I hate to say it,

24
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,551
but that was the Tribal
that I enjoyed the most.

25
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:57,448
Yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.

26
00:00:57,482 --> 00:00:58,724
He kept saying my name,

27
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,724
so I wanted that
for a long time.

28
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:03,034
<i>I'm playing this game</i> <i>
super chill</i>

29
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:05,551
<i>and under the radar because</i>

30
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:07,379
the inevitable is happening.
Everyone's looking

31
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:09,758
<i>to take out these big threats.</i>

32
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:11,068
<i>And it's perfect for me.</i>

33
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:12,379
<i>I can just sit back</i>

34
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:14,724
<i>and let these big egos</i>

35
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:17,448
<i>eat each other up, and then</i>

36
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:19,758
the underdogs
can take over this game.

37
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:25,448
I guess tomorrow we'll figure
out how much we really have.

38
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:29,241
Yeah.

39
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:36,206
Yeah.

40
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,896
<i>So, now</i>

41
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:43,344
that Hai is gone, the amulet
is now a Steal the Vote,

42
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:46,517
<i>which myself and Drea are able</i> <i>
to use if we work together.</i>

43
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:50,068
<i>So we now have</i> <i>
some extra ammo for us</i>

44
00:01:50,103 --> 00:01:52,206
<i>to use</i> <i>
to dwindle down the threats</i>

45
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:54,206
<i>that might get in the way</i> <i>
of our game to the final.</i>

46
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,000
The game's getting spicy now.

47
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:07,862
I went...

48
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,172
I was in St. Martin.
Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:10,827
And I went to take pictures
of a friend.

50
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:13,310
- Uh-huh.
- She's like, "Come take pictures of me in my swimsuit."

51
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:15,655
And she had very, like, thong
swimsuits and stuff like that.

52
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:17,275
And it's like a wedding, and
I was just like, "You go, girl."

53
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,827
Like, she was really taking the pictures. Like...

54
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:21,310
I saw it hang...

55
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:23,034
- Actually, I saw it hanging.
- Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

56
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:24,275
- Which one happ...? Which one? The pinkie?
- It's fine.

57
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,413
I actually lose my pinkie toes

58
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:26,758
- pretty often.
- That's odd to say.

59
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:28,275
- What? They're so small.
- Oh, yeah.

60
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,586
No, no, no,

61
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,137
it's not normal
to lose your toenails like that.

62
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:34,034
I'm so confused.
No, no.

63
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:36,413
They fall off, like, maybe,
like, two or three times a year.

64
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,793
Mine's never fallen off.

65
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:40,344
- No, but they...
- Like, that's regularly?

66
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,896
Like, that you have
an annual amount?

67
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,827
Like...

68
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:45,172
Two or three times a year.

69
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,689
Like...
Hey, there's normal,

70
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:47,931
and then there's Maryanne.
Like, I don't...

71
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:49,275
Yeah.
Yeah, right.

72
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,310
I've never been more miserable</i>

73
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:52,413
<i>or more hungry or more painful,</i>

74
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:54,620
but I'm having so much fun
out here, man.

75
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:56,034
<i>I don't want it to end.</i>

76
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:57,206
How has someone
not addressed this

77
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,275
to her before? Like...
No.

78
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,172
<i>Clearly, right now,</i>

79
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:01,655
<i>I'm not as big of a threat</i>

80
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,137
<i>as people think that I am,</i> <i>
which is a blessing</i>

81
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:05,586
'cause that means I'm probably
safe for the next Tribal,

82
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,172
but a curse, because if people
don't think you're a threat,

83
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:08,586
how are you going
to win at the end?

84
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,482
<i>But I've been really</i> <i>
taking a step back</i>

85
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:13,241
<i>because if you're someone</i> <i>
who's a big threat,</i>

86
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:14,758
<i>you're the next one out.</i>

87
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:19,103
I think
they're going after each other.

88
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,551
Who would have thought
that the people

89
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:21,965
on the bottom are now
in the power position?

90
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,896
It's <i>Survivor</i> flip.
The bottom's at the top,

91
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:26,413
- and the top's at the bottom.
- Yup.

92
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:33,034
<i>
I'm telling you right now,</i>

93
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:34,448
- this ain't brain surgery.
- No.

94
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:35,827
- No.
- It's really not.

95
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:37,724
If there's five,
and we're the best five,

96
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,482
let us fight it out.

97
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:40,931
I mean, who wouldn't...? Okay.

98
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:42,310
It surprises me that the two
of them are still here.

99
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:44,034
Yup.
Yeah.

100
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:45,827
Romeo-- it just bothers me
that he's just not working.

101
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,379
It's literally...
And he doesn't care.

102
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:48,724
- No.
- He just sits there while we're all working.

103
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:50,655
Don't know if I've ever
seen him do anything.

104
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,689
This is the movement I see.

105
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:53,482
Into the pot, into his mouth.

106
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:55,344
That's the only movement I see.

107
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,551
<i>
He keeps going, dipping in,</i> <i>
and then he eats the bottom.</i>

108
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,620
<i>You know, at the end</i> <i>
when you can lick the spoon,</i>

109
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,103
<i>from when you're...</i> <i>
they're making a cake?</i>

110
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:04,103
<i>He licked the spoon.</i>

111
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:05,655
Yeah.

112
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:06,862
You know what his best move is?</i>

113
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:09,689
This.

114
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:12,310
<i>That's his exercise.</i> <i>
That's what he does.</i>

115
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:14,034
<i>Romeo, Romeo,</i> <i>
wherefore art thou, Romeo?</i>

116
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:17,068
<i>He's sitting in the same spot</i> <i>
that he sat in 20 days ago.</i>

117
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:19,896
Hasn't moved.
That's where Romeo art thou.

118
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,103
<i>
Screw them.</i>

119
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,862
<i>I'm not doing anything for
anybody but myself out here, so,</i>

120
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,103
hell yes, I'm gonna eat
that rice. I'm hungry.

121
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:30,275
And it's not personal. I'm sure

122
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,551
I would love him
in a regular life,

123
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:33,689
but not here.
It's been aggravating me.

124
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:35,034
- Yeah.
- So what do you guys want to do?

125
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:37,034
Take this to the final five?

126
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,448
- I'm in.
- And duke it from there?

127
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:39,931
Yes.
I'm in 100%.

128
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:41,310
- You're in?
- Yeah.

129
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:42,827
<i>
I'm a competitor.</i>

130
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:44,413
<i>I'd rather play against people</i> <i>
who have been</i>

131
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:46,620
<i>playing hard the whole time.</i> <i>
Like, we came</i>

132
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:48,448
to play for a million bucks,
and I want to go with the people

133
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:50,172
who are playing
for a million bucks.

134
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,103
I know.
He just eats. He never cooks.

135
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:54,448
<i>
Romeo literally sits</i>

136
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:56,379
<i>in the same spot</i> <i>
throughout the entire day</i>

137
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:58,379
<i>but then will eat</i> <i>
the scraps of rice.</i>

138
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:01,034
<i>I feel so bad because
he's been with me since day one,</i>

139
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,517
<i>but I cannot.</i>

140
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:05,896
It's like, "Aah!"
It bothers me so much.

141
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,862
Bah! Aah!

142
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:10,310
We're gonna do the final five,
and then we duke it out

143
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,206
from there right here.

144
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,275
I give you my...
Listen, I give you my word.

145
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,965
- Same. Yeah. Same.
- I give youse my word.

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,620
I'm down.
Let's do this.

147
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,827
- ...bounds, uh, out there.
- Uh, I mean, no, right?

148
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:24,931
But what are you thinking?
To go with that?

149
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,517
<i>I was saying,</i> <i>
"Top five, us five,</i>

150
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:31,758
<i>the people</i> <i>
that deserve to be here." But</i>

151
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:33,000
it's mainly a game,
so Drea sees it

152
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:34,379
and she believes it,
and she votes for Romeo.

153
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:36,689
Ah.

154
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:38,586
<i>
To make Drea feel comfortable</i> <i>
that we're</i>

155
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,206
<i>all together in this,</i> <i>
and I think she bought it.</i>

156
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,000
<i>I hope she bought it.</i>

157
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:46,517
Listen, Drea gets to the final
three, she's gonna win, and...

158
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:49,965
<i>I got to look</i> <i>
at the big picture here.</i>

159
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,551
<i>And the big picture is,</i>

160
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,413
<i>Drea's the biggest threat left</i>

161
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:55,344
that I'm not working with.

162
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:58,034
- Drea is extremely good.
- She is good.

163
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:01,413
I'm actually really thirsty.

164
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,724
Are you guys gonna be done
with the water yet?

165
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:05,655
Drea.

166
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,068
- Yeah, we're coming.
- What are they saying?

167
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:09,758
They want us to be back
with the water.

168
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:11,862
I actually need my water!

169
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:13,172
<i>
At this point in the game,</i>

170
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,724
<i>people want</i> <i>
to push their agenda.</i>

171
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:17,034
<i>And after this big blindside</i>

172
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:18,931
<i>on Hai,</i> <i>
Mike's getting a little like,</i>

173
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:20,517
"Hmm. I just pulled off
my first big move,

174
00:06:20,551 --> 00:06:22,137
"and now I'm the big man

175
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:24,655
<i>who can rule and</i> <i>
tell people what to do."</i>

176
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:27,793
<i>But, like, people will go</i> <i>
after people like that.</i>

177
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:30,827
He's feeling high after Hai,
if you know what I mean.

178
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:32,827
<i>So I don't trust anything</i> <i>
Mike says anymore.</i>

179
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:35,586
<i>I think that he's playing harder</i> <i>
than he's letting on,</i>

180
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,724
<i>and you can tell he's become</i>

181
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:40,068
what he was accusing Hai
of doing.

182
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:41,793
He's become the new Hai,

183
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:44,034
<i>and that's not going to work</i> <i>
for him out here.</i>

184
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:47,000
<i>I can tell you that right now.</i>

185
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:01,620
<i>I just can't believe</i> <i>
there was no food.</i>

186
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,758
- Like, this really is way different.
- Yeah.

187
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,551
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:08,896
Like,
we're all feeling it today.

189
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,206
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes. Oh, my God.

190
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:11,379
- Like, it hit all of us, you know?
- Yeah.

191
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,137
Yeah. Minnows? Yeah.

192
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:19,413
<i>Coming into this,</i> <i>
one of the things that I did</i>

193
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:22,448
was go, "I'm gonna eat the
same amount as everybody else,

194
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:24,827
not put a target on my back,"
and it's worked.

195
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,655
I'm here. I'm at the top seven.

196
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,344
<i>But I burn 2,000 calories</i>

197
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:33,034
<i>a day not doing anything.</i>

198
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:36,310
<i>I'm getting to the point</i> <i>
where moving is-is rough.</i>

199
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:38,344
Jonathan, we're at the beach.

200
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:45,034
<i>
People here are literally</i> <i>
half my size,</i>

201
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:49,551
<i>and they're eating the same</i> <i>
amount as I am, so I have it</i>

202
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:51,655
a little worse than everybody
here, and that's the truth.

203
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,655
How long have I been
laying here?

204
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:55,172
Over an hour.

205
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,689
- Is there anybody around?
- No, they're all at the beach.

206
00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:58,931
Everybody?

207
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:02,586
I'll walk down there
with you in a second.

208
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,689
All right.

209
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:04,827
<i>
I wanted to be</i>

210
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:07,000
the provider,
and I've done that.

211
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:09,724
<i>I'm still the one</i> <i>
that starts the fires.</i>

212
00:08:09,758 --> 00:08:11,586
<i>I'm still the one</i> <i>
that catches the fish.</i>

213
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,103
<i>Six more days, and I can</i>

214
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,689
hopefully win this game
and move on.

215
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:19,896
But nobody sees how hard it is
for me, which is my game plan.

216
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:21,344
I don't want 'em to see.

217
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:24,551
So, how does this exactly work?

218
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,620
What do you do with it?
Meaning what?

219
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,241
Okay.

220
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:33,896
The little string
from the big string?

221
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,379
Little strings
from the big string, yes.

222
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:46,172
Huh? Uh, there's two people
working on it,

223
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,551
so I'd kind of get in the way. I...

224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,655
Everybody, take it easy on me.
I'm doing everything

225
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:59,827
I can do. Okay, Drea?

226
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:06,310
<i>
Jonathan is acting hangry</i> <i>
and kind of rude.</i>

227
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:08,862
<i>Kind of pisses me off.</i> <i>
I was just beyond</i>

228
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:11,517
shocked at how he was
approaching the situation.

229
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,827
- You're the fisherman.
- Yeah.

230
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:14,206
This is why I was like,
"Can you help?"

231
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:21,206
Are you kidding me?

232
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,862
If it wasn't for us
coming to get it,

233
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,965
he would have still
just been laying around.

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,827
<i>I really wanted to work</i>

235
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:29,551
<i>with strong players,</i> <i>
but Jonathan's lost</i>

236
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:31,689
a tremendous amount of weight.
He's weak.

237
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:34,586
<i>And I have no empathy for him</i> <i>
cause I'm on the same page.</i>

238
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,655
<i>I'm allergic to coconut,</i> <i>
so I can't eat coconut, so,</i>

239
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:39,206
I'm literally starving.

240
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:42,275
It comes off rude because...

241
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,241
I'm the one doing it all.

242
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:45,931
<i>I could use a thank-you.</i>

243
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:48,034
<i>The provider is supposed</i> <i>
to get props.</i>

244
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:50,655
<i>I want to be</i> <i>
a little more appreciated</i>

245
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:53,103
because if it's not seen,

246
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:55,137
then it's not working.

247
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,620
But...

248
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:57,896
But the way you talk
to people is not...

249
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,241
- Yeah.
- That's not okay with me.

250
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,068
Yeah, I hear you.

251
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:02,689
<i>
I have held my tongue</i>

252
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:04,448
so much.

253
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:07,413
<i>But just because</i> <i>
of that bickering, I know</i>

254
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:09,068
that that's gonna...
that's gonna put a seed

255
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:10,965
in their mind
to try to vote me off now.

256
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,379
He's in his mood...

257
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:28,689
Jonathan's starting to unravel.</i>

258
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:30,586
And people are picking up
on that.

259
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,931
<i>It's perfect timing because</i>

260
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,172
<i>I want Jonathan out because</i> <i>
of how he acts towards me.</i>

261
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:37,758
He's not a great ally.
He just dictates

262
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:39,034
on what I should do,
and if I disagree,

263
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:40,413
he gets annoyed with me.

264
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:47,827
Mm-hmm.

265
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:57,965
Yeah.

266
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:06,689
<i>Jonathan's the one person</i>

267
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:08,241
getting in the way
of me winning more challenges.

268
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:11,206
<i>But I know</i> <i>
what I'm capable of doing.</i>

269
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:13,448
<i>So it's balls to the wall</i> <i>
going all out</i>

270
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:16,655
<i>to make sure</i> <i>
Jonathan loses and goes home.</i>

271
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:27,551
All right,
seven players left in the game,

272
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,793
and today is the dangerous
Do or Die twist.

273
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:34,068
<i>It's a risky game of chance,</i>

274
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:36,068
<i>but it could be an opportunity</i> <i>
for somebody on the bottom.</i>

275
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,724
<i>If they win,</i>

276
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:39,206
they're safe,
can't be voted out.

277
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,862
If they lose, they're out,

278
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:43,413
but there is no vote involved,
and nothing can save them.

279
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:45,689
It is them against the game.

280
00:11:45,724 --> 00:11:47,172
<i>Last season when we did this,</i>

281
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,965
<i>Deshawn was in trouble.</i> <i>
He played Do or Die and won.</i>

282
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,655
<i>They couldn't vote him out.
He made it to the final three.</i>

283
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:54,931
There's no easy choice.

284
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,551
If you need immunity,
you have to compete.

285
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:58,344
But if you compete,
and you're first out,

286
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,482
you got to play Do or Die.
What would you do?

287
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:02,413
And remember,
they've not seen season 41.

288
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:04,310
They're going to be shocked.

289
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:05,862
Come on in.

290
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,344
All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

291
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,137
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- First things first, Lindsay.

292
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,310
Got to take it back.

293
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:26,206
- Thank you.
- Yup.

294
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:32,896
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

295
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:34,827
<i>For today's challenge,</i> <i>
you're going to balance</i>

296
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:36,551
<i>on a narrow perch</i> <i>
while holding a handle</i>

297
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,827
<i>behind your head.</i> <i>
At any point,</i>

298
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:43,310
<i>a foot comes off,
or a hand lets go, you're out.</i>

299
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:45,620
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

300
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:48,482
guaranteed a spot
in the final six.

301
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,482
There is a twist
to today's challenge.

302
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,379
And it's a dangerous one,

303
00:12:55,413 --> 00:12:58,689
but if you think you're
on the bottom, it could help.

304
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,655
Here's how it works.

305
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:03,068
The first person
to fall out of this challenge

306
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,758
will have to play a potentially

307
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:08,896
deadly game of chance
called <i>Survivor</i> Do or Die.

308
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:10,206
- What?
- What?

309
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,586
Tonight at Tribal Council,

310
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,068
the first person to fall out
of this challenge

311
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:15,931
will play this game of chance.

312
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:19,137
If you win, you're safe
and cannot be voted out.

313
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:23,551
Then we have a regular Tribal,
and somebody else is voted out.

314
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:25,586
If you lose, you're out,
and that's it.

315
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,344
Oh!
Nothing can protect you,

316
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,137
no idols, no advantage,
no Shot in the Dark, nothing.

317
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:32,896
It is you against the game.

318
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:36,206
So, your decision right now is,

319
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:39,413
do I compete or not?

320
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:41,931
Whoa.
If you think you need immunity,

321
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:44,344
you got to compete.
A lot of this comes down

322
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:46,655
to where you believe
you sit in the game.

323
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:49,965
How much knowledge do you have
about your relationships?

324
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,931
Because several people here
don't need immunity tonight.

325
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,275
Most of you are not going home.
One is.

326
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,413
If you think you're the one,
Do or Die is an option.

327
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:01,896
Remember, Do or Die
doesn't mean you're out.

328
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,000
It could mean
you're totally safe.

329
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:06,103
Omar, what are the variables

330
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,896
in this that you have
to think about right now?

331
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,896
Yeah, I mean,
this changes everything.

332
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:12,241
You have seven people here
who have been making plans

333
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:14,344
for the last few days,
but none of it may matter.

334
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,965
All right,
shall we make our decision

335
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,517
about who's gonna compete
and who isn't?

336
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,275
Yeah.
All right.

337
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,793
You'll each take one rock.

338
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,241
Purple means "I'm gonna play."

339
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,724
Gray means, "I'm gonna sit out."

340
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:30,344
<i>
It's a complicated decision.</i>

341
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:33,103
<i>Do or Die.
This is a game about risk, but</i>

342
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:34,862
<i>it's an incredible opportunity.</i>

343
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:37,000
- Take a look at which color's in which hand.
- Yeah.

344
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:39,758
<i>Hell, it could mean</i> <i>
that you're safe</i>

345
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:41,586
without anybody even voting
for you.

346
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,793
Once again,
purple means "I'm playing.

347
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:45,206
I got to go for it."

348
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:47,275
Gray is, "I'm not competing.

349
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,413
"I'm gonna give up my shot
at immunity, and I'm just gonna

350
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:50,931
"take my chances that I've
got a strong enough alliance

351
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,689
that I'm not in trouble
tonight."

352
00:14:54,586 --> 00:14:57,000
All right, everybody reveal.

353
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:01,689
Oh, my gosh.

354
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:03,896
Wow.
Jonathan is playing,

355
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:05,586
- and Lindsay is playing.
- Yeah.

356
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,931
And that is it.

357
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:08,862
Ooh!
Wow!

358
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:10,931
Had a feeling
that was going to happen.

359
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:12,896
Jonathan, it's kind of crazy.

360
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:15,068
- I mean, it's literally a showdown.
- I know.

361
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:16,862
I mean, honestly, I thought
it was gonna come down

362
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:19,034
to me and Lindsay,
so here we are.

363
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:22,000
I know. Lindsay,

364
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:24,689
you know right now
that you or Jonathan are going

365
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,517
to have your fate determined
by a game of chance.

366
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,931
Yeah, it's just the odds
are way worse now.

367
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:31,448
Like, I was hoping there'd
at least be three or four,

368
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:33,620
and there'd be a better chance
of me being to outplay that.

369
00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:35,551
But Jonathan and I have been
neck-to-neck

370
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:36,965
almost every single challenge, so

371
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,586
this is going to be
a battle royale right now.

372
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,379
All right, Omar,

373
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:46,896
Mike, Drea, Romeo, Maryanne,
you are not competing.

374
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:48,724
No shot at immunity,
which means you're vulnerable

375
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:50,206
at Tribal Council.

376
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,551
Take a spot over here.

377
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:53,758
We will leave
Jonathan and Lindsay

378
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:57,896
to get ready
for the competition.

379
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:09,241
Jonathan, Lindsay

380
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:12,241
side by side in a showdown.

381
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,758
Put your feet into position.

382
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:16,793
Your heels have
to be against the beam,

383
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:18,793
your butt and your back have
to be against the beam,

384
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:23,379
and your hands are holding
the handle behind your head.

385
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:26,482
All right, we are good.

386
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,896
And this challenge is on.

387
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:32,068
- Let's go, guys.
- Good job.
- Good job.

388
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,620
You can't ask
for more than this.

389
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:43,172
Two warriors...

390
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:47,655
...battling it out on day 21.

391
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:52,793
One player will be
in control of their fate.

392
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:54,379
One player will not.

393
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,103
Once again, <i>Survivor</i> testing you

394
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:04,310
in ways you could never predict

395
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:07,793
in a much more dangerous version
of <i>Survivor</i>

396
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:11,689
where the monster is
always starving.

397
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:15,068
Nowhere to hide.

398
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,172
You are five minutes
into this challenge.

399
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:34,068
Good job, guys.

400
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,482
Really impressive.

401
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:37,620
This challenge is no joke.

402
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:54,655
This is where you find out
how much is in that tank.

403
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:59,172
Jonathan
with a lot of movement.

404
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:06,137
Trying to find some way
to relieve the pain,

405
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,310
some way to block it.

406
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:13,965
Trying to breathe through it.

407
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,344
Two different body positions,
but both

408
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:18,586
are still doing
what you need to do.

409
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:23,551
Keep digging, just keep pushing.

410
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:27,448
You cannot lose focus.

411
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:34,827
Keep hanging in there.

412
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:37,620
Whatever it was
that made you sign up

413
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:40,827
to come play <i>Survivor,</i>
this is what you wanted.

414
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:42,517
This kind of a test.

415
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,793
- 12 minutes in.
- Ooh, good job, guys.

416
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:03,379
Stakes are huge

417
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,103
with Do or Die on the line.

418
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:07,931
Don't give in.

419
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,689
This is it. Dig it in.

420
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:14,931
Dig it in right here. Dig it in!

421
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:15,965
Come on, Lindsay.

422
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:19,448
Keep fighting.

423
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:31,413
Lindsay drops first!

424
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:32,793
Oh!

425
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:36,241
- Wow.
- Jonathan wins individual immunity

426
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,379
in a torturous challenge.

427
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:40,482
Wow!

428
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,965
Great job.

429
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,965
Good job.

430
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:52,275
Jonathan, come on over.

431
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,758
Good job, Jonathan.

432
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,172
Where are you feeling it
right now?

433
00:19:57,206 --> 00:19:58,896
My whole body. I feel like

434
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,517
my forearms are about
to fall off.

435
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:03,206
Well, you'll have time
to recover tonight

436
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,034
because you are safe
at Tribal Council,

437
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:07,517
guaranteed a spot
in the final six.

438
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,379
Well earned, risky move.
You are safe tonight.

439
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:11,793
Head back over.
Good job, Jonathan.

440
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:13,517
Nice job, Jonathan.

441
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:15,724
Jonathan, you are safe tonight.

442
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:17,034
You don't have anything
to worry about.

443
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:19,172
Lindsay, not the same for you.

444
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:20,758
So tonight at Tribal,

445
00:20:20,793 --> 00:20:24,344
your fate will be determined
by the game Do or Die.

446
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:26,482
If you win, the good news is,

447
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,034
you're safe
and cannot be voted out.

448
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:30,758
But if you lose, you're done.

449
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:33,586
If you're safe, there is a vote,

450
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,206
and somebody else is voted out.

451
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:38,137
Day 21 of <i>Survivor 42.</i>

452
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:40,172
Stakes have never been higher.

453
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,758
All right, everybody, grab
your stuff, head back to camp.

454
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:43,034
See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

455
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:45,379
<i>
Lindsay is tough as nails.</i>

456
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:47,551
<i>She's the number one competitor</i> <i>
that I have to go against</i>

457
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:48,896
<i>for this necklace.</i>

458
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:50,689
<i>To be honest with you,</i> <i>
it wouldn't hurt me</i>

459
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:52,344
if she left tonight.

460
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:54,793
I mean, I hate to say it.
She's a great...

461
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't hate to say it.
That's the game.

462
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,000
<i>If it's time for her to go,
then I'm okay with her leaving.</i>

463
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:06,586
<i>I had my husband's voice</i> <i>
in my head like,</i>

464
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,034
"You suck at endurance."

465
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:10,034
Especially, like, my feet.
I was like,

466
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,103
"Mm, that's not gonna happen."

467
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:17,965
Yeah, Lindsay took

468
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,103
<i>a chance, and I'm proud of her.</i>

469
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:25,551
That was a million-dollar gamble
that I made today.</i>

470
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:28,965
<i>Now, tonight comes into</i> <i>
a game of chance, and...</i>

471
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,965
I'm very disappointed in myself, because...

472
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,896
that was such a dumb decision.

473
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:36,586
<i>I felt safe.</i>

474
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,517
<i>I didn't need to do that, but
I wanted to just beat Jonathan.</i>

475
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:41,862
So, me being a competitor
my whole life

476
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,103
totally came into play.

477
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:45,241
<i>I've always played sports.</i>

478
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,620
<i>At nine, I was like,</i> <i>
"Football looks really fun."</i>

479
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:49,034
<i>And I signed up.</i> <i>
I was the only girl</i>

480
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:50,793
<i>in the entire league</i> <i>
of the town.</i>

481
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:53,620
<i>And I busted my ass</i> <i>
and I earned my spot</i>

482
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:56,965
<i>and I played every single game</i> <i>
for six years.</i>

483
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,413
<i>And that's where my personality</i>

484
00:21:58,448 --> 00:22:01,344
and just who I am
just slipped in.

485
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:04,724
It just sucks how Linds...

486
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,103
- She should have just not played.
- I know.

487
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:09,965
And now I literally might be out
from that one mistake.</i>

488
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,965
<i>But...</i>

489
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:22,448
I'm proud of myself
that I gave it my all.

490
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:23,793
I'm proud of myself

491
00:22:23,827 --> 00:22:28,413
<i>that I fought,
and I'm not out of the game yet.</i>

492
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,551
I let my head...

493
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,965
Which is what I should've done.

494
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,448
No, don't say that.
No, don't live with regrets.

495
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:36,448
You don't know what it is yet,
you know?

496
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:39,000
- You don't...
- You're acting like you're already home.

497
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:40,172
- Like...
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

498
00:22:40,206 --> 00:22:41,655
We'll see what happens.

499
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:43,724
<i>It was bittersweet 'cause</i> <i>
I was rooting for my girl,</i>

500
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:45,034
<i>but at the same time,</i>

501
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:48,034
I am hoping
Lindsay goes home tonight.

502
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,758
Obviously I'm not
gonna tell her that,

503
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:53,310
<i>but, like, if she goes home,</i>

504
00:22:53,344 --> 00:22:55,827
<i>there's only one amulet</i> <i>
left in the game.</i>

505
00:22:55,862 --> 00:22:59,241
And that means
that my amulet becomes an idol.

506
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:02,172
So then that would mean
I have an idol in my bag,

507
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:06,103
plus the Knowledge
Is Power advantage.

508
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:08,172
<i>I also have my extra vote.</i>

509
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:09,896
<i>So tonight is</i> <i>
a major night for me.</i>

510
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,689
But if Lindsay does
her Do or Die

511
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,034
and she's still in the game,

512
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:14,793
<i>we will have to send</i> <i>
someone else home.</i>

513
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:17,482
<i>And I feel like</i> <i>
Romeo's name is out there</i>

514
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:20,206
<i>because Romeo doesn't really</i> <i>
do that much around camp.</i>

515
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:21,310
- It's Romeo.
- Yeah.

516
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,551
Please.

517
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:23,758
- I'm sticking to the plan.
- I'm gonna...

518
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:25,137
'Cause I think I'm playing
my idol tonight,

519
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,413
- 'cause I'm nervous.
- No. I'm sticking to the plan.

520
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,965
<i>
Yesterday,</i> <i>
I set up a little plan</i>

521
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,827
<i>that the decoy vote tonight</i> <i>
is Romeo.</i>

522
00:23:31,862 --> 00:23:32,827
<i>Thankfully,</i>

523
00:23:32,862 --> 00:23:34,862
Drea bought my story.

524
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:37,517
<i>Because if Lindsay doesn't go</i> <i>
out tonight, I want Drea out.</i>

525
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:41,448
...we have a straight line
to the final four.

526
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:43,241
Right, and she's a huge threat.

527
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:44,620
- We'd be crazy.
- Right.

528
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:46,241
<i>Drea's a threat.</i> <i>
She's super likable.</i>

529
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:48,068
I think she's
a great badass woman.

530
00:23:48,103 --> 00:23:50,965
<i>And I would have</i> <i>
the only amulet left.</i>

531
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,965
<i>I would have an idol</i> <i>
in my pocket</i>

532
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,172
if she left.

533
00:23:53,206 --> 00:23:54,379
I got-- You got my word.

534
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:55,413
- I got you...
- All right, love you, baby.

535
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:56,517
I'll see you later.

536
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:57,689
Drea better hope that I go home,</i>

537
00:23:57,724 --> 00:23:59,379
<i>'cause if not,</i> <i>
it's gonna be her.</i>

538
00:24:03,724 --> 00:24:05,344
If I make it to the final three,</i>

539
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,000
<i>I don't want to be</i> <i>
sitting by Drea.</i>

540
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:08,551
Drea has more on her résumé

541
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:09,551
<i>than me.</i>

542
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:10,931
<i>She'd be hard to beat.</i>

543
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:12,551
If she makes it to the final
three, she's gonna win.

544
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:13,862
Yeah.

545
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:15,724
- Hey, I'm just being real with you.
- Yeah.

546
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:17,310
<i>Drea's been playing</i> <i>
such a good game.</i>

547
00:24:17,344 --> 00:24:19,172
<i>She's always been</i> <i>
in the majority.</i>

548
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:23,034
If anybody lets her get
to the end, she will win.

549
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:24,896
Point blank. Period.

550
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,379
That's my word.

551
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:29,103
- Drea.
- Got you. Okay, cool.

552
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:30,241
All right, thank you.

553
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:31,620
<i>Boom, boom, boom, like dominoes</i>

554
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:33,827
<i>right in a row.</i> <i>
Everybody's on board.</i>

555
00:24:33,862 --> 00:24:35,137
There's five days left.

556
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,068
I could do it going backwards
with my eyes closed.

557
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:39,241
<i>And quite frankly,</i> <i>
I have an idol in my pocket.</i>

558
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:42,275
<i>If I feel even the "bittest"</i> <i>
that I'm being played,</i>

559
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,344
<i>I will not hesitate</i> <i>
to play it in a second.</i>

560
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:47,448
- So, it's Drea tonight.
- Oh.

561
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:50,206
- We're just making sure that everything is-is all good.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

562
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:52,034
But she also
can't be aware of it,

563
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:54,068
- because she has the extra vote.
- Yeah.

564
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,758
Yeah.
Okay.

565
00:24:57,793 --> 00:24:59,413
<i>Knocking Drea out here</i> <i>
removes an extra vote</i>

566
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:01,655
and removes a player
who's gonna be

567
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:03,827
<i>a really strong contender</i> <i>
at the end of the game.</i>

568
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:06,896
Oh, yeah, you should.

569
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:08,482
But the smarter side of me says,</i>

570
00:25:08,517 --> 00:25:10,448
"Mike is a threat to win,

571
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:12,827
<i>and I want to blindside him</i> <i>
and make a big move."</i>

572
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:15,241
<i>But at this point,</i> <i>
I feel like it's too risky,</i>

573
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:17,241
<i>'cause Mike has</i> <i>
that hidden immunity idol.</i>

574
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:19,241
<i>And so,</i> <i>
that makes the decision easy.</i>

575
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:21,689
<i>If Lindsay is safe,</i> <i>
and Drea is going home,</i>

576
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:22,827
<i>it seems set in stone.</i>

577
00:25:22,862 --> 00:25:24,448
Wait, you were praying?

578
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,103
Okay. Geez.

579
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:30,724
<i>I could feel</i> <i>
my stomach turning.</i>

580
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:31,862
I've been staring at people

581
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,896
and observe, like,
how they're moving,

582
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:35,620
<i>how they're acting,</i> <i>
who they're talking to.</i>

583
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:38,344
<i>It's weird.</i> <i>
It's a very weird vibe.</i>

584
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:40,137
Mike is saying that it's Romeo,

585
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:43,379
<i>but now my gut tells me</i> <i>
that Mike is lying to me.</i>

586
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:45,965
So... is the plan

587
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,206
- <i>-
- Romeo?</i> <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

588
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:51,758
<i>-
Yes.</i> <i>
And then</i>

589
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:53,310
we have to try to get Mike
to play his immunity idol,

590
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,344
basically.

591
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:56,034
I'm gonna take
his immunity idol.

592
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:57,655
- You can take it?
- Yes.

593
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:58,758
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

594
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,482
You can take it from him?

595
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,793
- You're the only person I've told, Omar.
- Okay.

596
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,586
- You're literally the only person I've told.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

597
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,344
It's before the votes.
I have to say, "Hey, Jeff."

598
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:08,758
- It's public?
- Yeah.

599
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:12,000
Mike does not know

600
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:13,724
that I have
the Knowledge Is Power

601
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:16,068
and have the ability
to take his idol tonight.

602
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:23,172
<i>I decided to tell Omar,</i> <i>
because I believe</i>

603
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,827
<i>Omar is someone that I can work
with towards the finish line.</i>

604
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:28,827
Mike told me
that he might play it today.

605
00:26:28,862 --> 00:26:30,068
- His immunity idol?
- Yeah.

606
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:31,448
So...

607
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:33,310
we may have to vote Mike today.

608
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:38,310
<i>
We have to.</i>

609
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:39,310
<i>
So, it'll be</i>

610
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:41,068
- me, you...
- Me, you, Lindsay.

611
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:42,586
Lindsay, Romeo, extra vote.
- Romeo, extra vote.

612
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,517
So that's five votes on Mike.
- Mm-hmm.

613
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:48,103
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

614
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:49,689
<i>
This changes everything.</i>

615
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:52,448
<i>I mean, at this point,
Mike thinks he's totally safe.</i>

616
00:26:52,482 --> 00:26:53,724
It's the perfect time
to take him out,

617
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:55,103
'cause he won't see it coming.

618
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:56,655
And with Drea stealing his idol,

619
00:26:56,689 --> 00:26:58,034
<i>he has no backup protection.</i>

620
00:26:58,068 --> 00:26:59,724
He told me that it's you.

621
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:06,068
'Cause he will
never see that coming.

622
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:08,068
- It would be epic.
- I agree.

623
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:11,241
<i>
This is big,
because Drea told me her power.</i>

624
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:12,827
So, like, we can't let it spill.

625
00:27:12,862 --> 00:27:16,724
So, she will steal Mike's
hidden immunity idol tonight,

626
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:18,517
and she wants to blindside Mike.

627
00:27:18,551 --> 00:27:19,758
<i>
Whoa.</i>

628
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:21,172
So Mike's hidden immunity idol</i>

629
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,655
<i>will be Drea's tonight.</i>

630
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:24,068
<i>
Wow.</i>

631
00:27:24,103 --> 00:27:25,862
Oh, my God. This is crazy.

632
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:26,862
Yeah, for sure.

633
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,103
- I know. This shocked me.
- So...

634
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:29,517
- I know...
- It changes everything.

635
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:32,310
Because we can blindside Mike
and get him out,

636
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:34,517
<i>or--
telling him what the power is--</i>

637
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:36,000
<i>Mike gives us the idol.</i>

638
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,172
And this way, we still have
control of where the idol is.

639
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:41,862
By removing the idol from Mike's
pocket and putting it in mine,</i>

640
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:45,482
Drea's advantage
is basically neutered

641
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:47,793
<i>and so is Mike's
'cause he doesn't have his idol.</i>

642
00:27:47,827 --> 00:27:49,482
<i>And then it's, like,</i> <i>
free for the taking.</i>

643
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,137
You can take either one out.

644
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:52,827
- My gut says to take out Mike.
- My gut says...

645
00:27:52,862 --> 00:27:55,344
I know, but my gut says
I don't trust Drea as much.

646
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:56,724
And there's so many ways
that I could go.

647
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,344
<i>We let Drea steal Mike's idol,</i>

648
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:00,827
<i>he's blindsided,</i> <i>
and Mike goes home.</i>

649
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:02,517
- It's gonna be cool. Okay.
- I know.

650
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:05,965
<i>
Or tell Mike</i> <i>
about the advantage</i>

651
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,034
<i>and then blindside Drea</i> <i>
to keep him happy.</i>

652
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:09,620
He's an ally.

653
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,068
<i>He's a vote.</i>

654
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,241
<i>The other option is,
if I keep his idol in my pocket</i>

655
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:16,517
<i>and vote out Mike,</i>

656
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:17,758
<i>then I don't have</i> <i>
to give it back to him.</i>

657
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:20,413
Officially,
possession of the idol is mine.

658
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,344
I can't wait. Dude.

659
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:27,000
<i>
And yet</i> <i>
none of this may matter.</i>

660
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:29,586
Lindsay may go home
in the Do or Die,

661
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,000
<i>and then</i> <i>
we're back to square one.</i>

662
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:05,172
All right,
so let's start with

663
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:08,344
today's immunity challenge
and the twist.

664
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,103
If I need immunity,
I got to compete.

665
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:11,517
But if I compete
and I'm first out,

666
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:12,862
I got to play Do or Die.

667
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:16,241
And everybody sat out
except Jonathan and Lindsay.

668
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:18,827
Jonathan,
what was the thought process

669
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:20,482
of why you were
going to compete?

670
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,172
I know that I need it, Mr. Jeff.

671
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:23,758
I mean,
we're this close to the end,

672
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:26,344
so there was
no real choice for me.

673
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:27,896
I had to commit and do it. Lindsay,

674
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:29,448
you were the only other person

675
00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:31,000
that stood up
and said "I'm competing."

676
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:34,137
Honestly, my competitive nature

677
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,241
overtook my gut,
and I made a poor choice.

678
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:41,206
And I was blinded
without double-checking

679
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:42,862
does this make sense
in the game to do?

680
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:44,965
Mike, what was it like
to watch these two?

681
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,724
Because it was
a pretty intense battle.

682
00:29:46,758 --> 00:29:48,379
Their bodies gave out.

683
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,793
It was unbelievable.
I got to be honest with you.

684
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:51,689
I have total respect
for both of them.

685
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,689
And I know Lindsay said
she did a stupid thing.

686
00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:55,103
I don't think
she did a stupid thing at all.

687
00:29:55,137 --> 00:29:56,379
I think she did a warrior thing.

688
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:59,068
Whatever happens tonight,
Lindsay's gonna be fine.

689
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:00,551
She's a remarkable young woman.

690
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:02,413
She's gonna be successful
through life.

691
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:03,758
And what she did today

692
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:05,034
just showed the kind of person
that she really is,

693
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,724
and that's who I can respect.

694
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:07,931
And then also,

695
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:09,448
Lindsay and Jonathan have
always been head-to-head

696
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:11,068
every single competition.

697
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,517
So Lindsay going
and stepping up,

698
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:13,758
I don't think was
a bad decision

699
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:14,827
based on the track record.

700
00:30:14,862 --> 00:30:16,241
And, like, I hope that,

701
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,068
however this turns out, that you
don't lose that competitiveness,

702
00:30:18,103 --> 00:30:19,862
because that's a good trait
to have.

703
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:21,586
- And I want you to know that, okay?
- Thank you.

704
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,413
I appreciate that. Thank you.

705
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:25,793
Omar, was it hard
for you to sit out

706
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:27,965
from a competition
point of view?

707
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,034
I was sitting on the bench
watching them, very impressed,

708
00:30:30,068 --> 00:30:33,862
but also happy with the decision
that I made, because I grew up,

709
00:30:33,896 --> 00:30:36,551
my parents were like, "You get
an education, and that's it.

710
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,034
You don't, you don't go to gym class. I don't care."

711
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:40,931
So, you know,
that's not my strength

712
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,965
to go up against these two.

713
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,103
All right,
so you get back to camp.

714
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:46,896
Maryanne, what's the vibe?

715
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:49,172
Because you can't
"kind of" approach it

716
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:51,068
like there might be a vote,
'cause there might be a vote,

717
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:53,172
depending on what happens
with Do or Die.

718
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:55,517
The scrambling always starts,
you know?

719
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:57,034
And there's some people
who are going in,

720
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,413
they're pulling
many people aside.

721
00:30:58,448 --> 00:30:59,793
There's some people
who are just like...

722
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:02,344
And then it's the head nod plan
or the scramble plan

723
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:03,862
that goes tonight if...

724
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:05,413
And if it even happens.

725
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:06,482
So, Mike, does that mean

726
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:08,275
that there are literally
different ways

727
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,620
of communicating
for different plans

728
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:11,517
within different alliances?

729
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:12,517
Absolutely.

730
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:15,275
It's either... or it's...

731
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,172
But if you see this one,
get to the water well.

732
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:20,000
You see this one, just relax.

733
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:22,172
So you kind of know
the winks and the nods.

734
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:25,206
Drea, when you see
the sign Mike talked about,

735
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:27,137
which is, you know, 911,

736
00:31:27,172 --> 00:31:29,344
how do you react in the moment?

737
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:32,931
I see who he's looking at,
and I observe.

738
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:35,551
Just like I see
when Jonathan gets up

739
00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:38,448
and tries to talk to numerous
people throughout the day.

740
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:39,827
And I observe.

741
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:41,758
And I see when numerous people
go to the water well,

742
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:44,379
and they come back and
their canteens are still empty.

743
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:45,655
I observe.

744
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:47,482
When they go for wood,

745
00:31:47,517 --> 00:31:49,379
but there's no wood in their hands.

746
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:51,034
I observe.

747
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:54,379
Omar, it was almost getting
like a horror movie,

748
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,689
the way she's, "I've been watching you."
Yeah. Yeah.

749
00:31:55,724 --> 00:31:57,068
It's a creepy vibe.

750
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:59,517
Like, all of a sudden,
you introduce this twist,

751
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,344
and now we can't just
assume Lindsay's going home.

752
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,103
Somebody else may be going home.

753
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:05,931
Today was the most paranoid
I've ever seen people,

754
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,000
and it's weird, 'cause
we might not even have a vote.

755
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:10,551
Jonathan, what kind of energy

756
00:32:10,586 --> 00:32:13,275
did you feel, knowing
that you were safe tonight?

757
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,275
When people talk to you,
it's a whole different level,

758
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,137
because they look at you
and go, "Well, Jonathan's safe.

759
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:20,482
So I can tell him more
or I can do more."

760
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:22,137
They work with you more.

761
00:32:23,172 --> 00:32:26,137
Drea, that's really interesting,
because if somebody

762
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:28,413
were to tell Jonathan
more than they might normally--

763
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:31,275
because tonight he's safe--
and there is no vote,

764
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,724
then Jonathan just got
all this free information.

765
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:36,344
Him having
whatever information he has

766
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:38,586
doesn't change my gameplay.

767
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,448
I didn't come into <i>Survivor</i>
to just depend on other people

768
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:42,758
to help me get through.

769
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:44,137
Alliances are there,

770
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:46,793
but alliances also
flip on people, as we see.

771
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:49,551
So I play like it's my last day.

772
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:52,379
Listen, everything you say
in this game to somebody

773
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:54,827
means something about
or to somebody.

774
00:32:54,862 --> 00:32:57,310
So you have to be careful
how you choose your words.

775
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,310
Even in just regular talk,

776
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,896
because people
misinterpret sometimes

777
00:33:00,931 --> 00:33:03,034
what you say to mean
something different.

778
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,724
And you say, like,
"I didn't mean that at all."

779
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:07,724
Omar, that's also
very interesting,

780
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:09,068
in that Mike is saying sometimes

781
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,413
you could say something wrong,
even unintentionally.

782
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:14,655
Yeah, I mean, that's also
why you have to be careful

783
00:33:14,689 --> 00:33:15,862
with the winks and the nods,

784
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:17,551
'cause people
might get the wrong idea.

785
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:19,724
And sometimes,
you need to know when to stop.

786
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:21,206
Because, like Mike said,

787
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:24,068
"You keep going, you're gonna
run out into the train tracks

788
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:25,241
and get run over."

789
00:33:28,068 --> 00:33:30,896
All right,
before we go to the vote,

790
00:33:30,931 --> 00:33:34,482
we have to determine if
there is going to be a vote.

791
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:35,931
Let me set up the game, Lindsay.

792
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,034
Good luck.

793
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,655
- Good luck, Linds.
- Good luck, Lindsay.

794
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:40,862
Thank you.

795
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:45,517
- Oh, my God.
- Gosh.

796
00:33:48,344 --> 00:33:49,793
All right, Lindsay, come on up.

797
00:33:51,241 --> 00:33:52,379
Good luck, Linds.

798
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,344
All right, Lindsay,
we have three Do or Die boxes.

799
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:03,517
In one of these boxes
is a flame.

800
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:05,206
Flame represents life.

801
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:08,068
If you choose the flame,
you live, you survive.

802
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:10,000
- You make the final six.
- Oh, my gosh.

803
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,827
You can't be voted out.
- Oh, my gosh.

804
00:34:11,862 --> 00:34:13,724
Two of these boxes have a skull.

805
00:34:13,758 --> 00:34:15,827
Skull represents death.

806
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,310
Death.
You draw the skull,

807
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:20,448
there is no vote, you're out,

808
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:21,862
you join the jury.

809
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:27,448
It's a big, big decision.
Take a moment.

810
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,931
I have my idea on one box,

811
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:31,034
- but then I have a backup of another box.
- Mm.

812
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,724
- Oh... you guys.
- That's a, that's a problem.

813
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:38,344
- I'm-
- I'm stalling, as you can see.

814
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,310
Okay. Middle box.

815
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:48,206
Before we open your box,

816
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:50,965
I'm gonna open
one of these two boxes.

817
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,034
- Okay?
- Okay.

818
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:58,137
The skull.

819
00:34:58,172 --> 00:34:59,517
Oh, my God.

820
00:34:59,551 --> 00:35:02,586
There is now one skull
and one flame.

821
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,241
The last twist is,
you can swap them if you want.

822
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:07,448
Oh, gosh.

823
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:11,896
Your gut told you
to do something,

824
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:14,241
but you also
said you had a backup plan.

825
00:35:14,275 --> 00:35:15,758
That was my backup plan.

826
00:35:15,793 --> 00:35:17,379
Oh, God.

827
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:18,517
So I'm gonna go with my gut.

828
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,206
You're gonna stay
with what you chose?

829
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:21,896
- Yeah.
- Come on, Linds.

830
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:25,241
If it is a flame,

831
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:27,206
you're guaranteed
a spot in the final six.

832
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,862
If it's a skull,
you're out of the game

833
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,206
and will go to the jury.

834
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:32,862
Let's reveal your box.

835
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:37,862
Oh, my God!
Yeah!

836
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:39,517
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yes!

837
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:41,068
Wow.

838
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:44,034
Oh, my gosh. Yes, Lindsay.

839
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:46,103
- You drew the flame. You are safe.
- Oh, my God.

840
00:35:46,137 --> 00:35:47,724
Here is the other skull.

841
00:35:47,758 --> 00:35:49,517
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

842
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:51,034
Oh, my God.

843
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:53,448
- You deserve that.
- Wow.

844
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,689
- You're back.
- Good job. Man.

845
00:35:56,724 --> 00:35:58,724
That's crazy.

846
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:00,620
Damn, Jeff.

847
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:01,827
Man.

848
00:36:01,862 --> 00:36:02,827
What's the feeling right now?

849
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:04,793
So much relief.

850
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:08,827
I... I-I don't know. I'm, like,
speechless at this moment.

851
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:10,482
I can't even...

852
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:12,586
God, I love <i>Survivor.</i> This is awesome.

853
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,896
Great job, Linds.

854
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:14,965
- Good job.
- Holy crap.

855
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,620
- Great job. U-Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

856
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:18,034
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow.

857
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:21,000
All right,
despite the celebration,

858
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:23,310
this means
we are going to vote.

859
00:36:23,344 --> 00:36:24,655
One second. Yes.

860
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:26,586
So...

861
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:31,206
...I've heard that my name
has been out there a few times.

862
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:35,000
And luckily, my work from
earlier in the season helped me

863
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:37,862
find this amazing advantage.

864
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,517
The Knowledge Is Power advantage.

865
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:42,965
"This advantage
offers you power in the game.

866
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,689
"Here's how it works.

867
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:46,896
"You are allowed
to ask one player

868
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:48,413
"either of
the following two questions:

869
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:50,896
"Do you have an advantage?
Or do you have an idol?

870
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:53,724
"If the answer is yes, they
must give you the advantage

871
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:54,827
"or idol, and it becomes yours.

872
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:56,793
"If the answer is no,

873
00:36:56,827 --> 00:36:58,862
"you receive nothing

874
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:00,379
"and this advantage
becomes powerless.

875
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:04,793
"To be clear, you can only
ask one player one question

876
00:37:04,827 --> 00:37:07,448
one time. That is it."

877
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:10,137
And I can verify they can't
lie, 'cause I know who has what.

878
00:37:10,172 --> 00:37:12,172
Perfect.
Okay.

879
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:14,172
Mike, do you have an idol?

880
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:17,896
No.

881
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:20,896
Oh...

882
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:22,172
That wasn't good.

883
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,103
Oh, my gosh!

884
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:27,310
<i>
About a half an hour</i> <i>
before Tribal,</i>

885
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:29,586
<i>Omar made me aware</i>

886
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,586
that Drea
had this little trinket

887
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,689
that she's gonna use against me.

888
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,620
Okay.

889
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:37,896
But if I don't have my idol
on me,

890
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:39,206
<i>Drea can't take it.</i>

891
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:40,448
I'm giving you my idol.

892
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:42,137
<i>Giving away an immunity idol.</i>

893
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:43,758
<i>Could I be taken
to the cleaners by these guys?</i>

894
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:45,482
Will they give it back?
They don't have to give it back.

895
00:37:45,517 --> 00:37:47,724
They could say,
"Nah, Mike, it's mine,"

896
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:49,689
<i>and knock me out tonight.</i>

897
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:52,413
- And with that, it is time to vote.
- Time to vote.

898
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:54,379
Romeo, you're up.

899
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,068
Nice try, Drea.

900
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,724
If anybody has
an advantage or an idol,

901
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:37,655
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

902
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:42,827
All right, I'll read the votes.

903
00:38:48,137 --> 00:38:49,896
First vote. Drea.

904
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,689
Mike. One vote Drea,
one vote Mike.

905
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,931
Drea. Two votes Drea.

906
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:03,793
Mike. We're tied again.

907
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:06,000
Two votes Drea,
two votes Mike.

908
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:08,827
Drea.

909
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:09,931
Three votes Drea.

910
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,551
Mike. We're tied again.

911
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:19,793
Three votes Drea,
three votes Mike.

912
00:39:23,758 --> 00:39:24,862
Drea.

913
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:27,206
That's four votes Drea,
three votes Mike.

914
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,275
One vote left.

915
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:34,793
12th person voted out
of <i>Survivor 42.</i>

916
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:37,103
I gave it all.

917
00:39:37,137 --> 00:39:39,034
I love you, baby. Give me a hug.

918
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:40,655
- Good job, Drea.
- Hey, great job.

919
00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:41,896
Great job.
I went out fighting.

920
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:43,172
I'm proud of you.
I love you.

921
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:44,793
You threw two...
I love you, too.

922
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:46,000
I threw two on you.

923
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:49,931
Yeah.

924
00:39:51,896 --> 00:39:53,068
I'm still coming out.

925
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:55,034
I love you.

926
00:39:55,068 --> 00:39:59,034
Bye.

927
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:00,758
Oh, my God. Oh.

928
00:40:01,793 --> 00:40:04,862
Lindsay, I'm rooting for you. You know why.
Thank you.

929
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:06,517
Jonathan, believe it or not,

930
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:10,379
you were never on my radar,
but you were always after me.

931
00:40:10,413 --> 00:40:13,275
Mike, if you make it to the end,
you'll probably win.

932
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,379
Thank you.
Kiss of death.

933
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,034
Romeo, you've been
on the block every time.

934
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:21,413
Omar, you're the only person
I told the secret to,

935
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:23,103
and I want everyone else
to know that.

936
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:24,689
Maryanne, keep being you, babe.

937
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:26,586
Thank you.
You're welcome.

938
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,068
Love you, Drea.
Bye, Drea. Hey.
Bye, Drea.

939
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:29,310
You gave me two. I like it.

940
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,068
I know! I really did!

941
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:34,034
- I was, "Where the hell'd that other come from?"
- I pulled it out of my pants

942
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:35,413
and everything. Damn.

943
00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:37,896
I'll see you later.
I love your gameplay.

944
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:39,275
I fought to the end...
Good job.

945
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,034
- Hell yeah, you did. Bye, guys.
- Bye.

946
00:40:42,517 --> 00:40:43,793
Never seen a moment like this.

947
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,724
Drea.

948
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:48,551
No...

949
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:51,586
Go for it.

950
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,724
- The tribe has spoken.
- No!

951
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:56,793
You can snuff it.

952
00:40:56,827 --> 00:40:58,034
But I got to say it.

953
00:40:58,068 --> 00:40:59,482
Do you want to say it?

954
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:01,931
The tribe has spoken.

955
00:41:06,241 --> 00:41:07,862
- Bye, Drea. Love you, baby.
- Bye, Drea.

956
00:41:07,896 --> 00:41:09,034
Bye, Drea.
I love you.

957
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:11,724
See you on the other side.
Love you.

958
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:14,620
- That was a great departure.
- Yeah.

959
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:19,793
I got to say, just as a viewer,

960
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:22,344
I can't think of a season
where I've ever seen

961
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,758
this much fierce gameplay

962
00:41:24,793 --> 00:41:26,551
and camaraderie.

963
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:28,344
This is the ideal way,
in my mind,

964
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:30,206
for <i>Survivor</i> to be played

965
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:32,896
because it is just a game
and it is just an adventure,

966
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:34,241
and it's an experience
with people

967
00:41:34,275 --> 00:41:35,655
that you're going
to know forever.

968
00:41:35,689 --> 00:41:37,310
- Yup.
- I thought it was awesome.

969
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:38,413
- Thank you.
- You've made it

970
00:41:38,448 --> 00:41:39,793
to the final six.
Grab your torches.

971
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:41,034
- Head back to camp.
- Have a great night, Jeff.

972
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:42,655
- Thank you. Have a good one.
- Good night.

973
00:41:42,689 --> 00:41:44,310
Oh, man. Lindsay,

974
00:41:44,344 --> 00:41:46,379
- I am so happy for you.
- Thanks.
