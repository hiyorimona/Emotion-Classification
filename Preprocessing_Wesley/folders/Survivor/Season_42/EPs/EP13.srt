1
00:00:02,241 --> 00:00:05,827
Welcome to
the finale of <i>Survivor 42.</i>

2
00:00:05,862 --> 00:00:07,448
I love finale nights,

3
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:09,689
and I think tonight
is gonna be very exciting

4
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:11,103
and very unpredictable

5
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:14,034
because there are still
so many ways it could play out

6
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:17,103
and so many players who have
a legit shot to win.

7
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:19,103
There are only
two weapons left in the game--

8
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:21,000
Mike and Maryanne
both have idols.

9
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:23,517
They both have to play
them with five players left,

10
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:27,000
which means, in theory,
they both get to four.

11
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:29,689
Which means, in theory,
they're at least making fire--

12
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:32,758
which means at least one
of them is in the final three.

13
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:33,931
So for the other players,

14
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:36,137
it will come down
to immunity challenges,

15
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:39,206
because, without the necklace,
you are left to rely

16
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:42,344
on your ability
to persuade other players

17
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:44,965
that what you want
is what they need.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,206
And that is very tough
to do on <i>Survivor,</i>

19
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:49,448
because both can't be true.

20
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,862
There's only one winner.

21
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:53,206
So tonight we're gonna have
two immunity challenges,

22
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:55,793
two Tribal Councils,
one fire-making showdown,

23
00:00:55,827 --> 00:00:58,655
and then we will read the votes
here in beautiful Fiji

24
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:01,551
and go right into the aftershow
and talk about everything,

25
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:04,655
while the players are still raw
and hungry and dirty.

26
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,275
Take a look at this final five.
That's a final five.

27
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,620
You have Mike, Jonathan,
Romeo, Lindsay and Maryanne.

28
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,034
Three of them are gonna get
to the end to get a chance

29
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:15,931
to plead their case
about why they deserve

30
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:17,413
the title of Sole Survivor

31
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,620
and the million dollars
that goes along with it.

32
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:20,758
Here we go.

33
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:24,172
This is
the finale of <i>Survivor 42.</i>

34
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:35,448
<i>
Savagery is what's</i> <i>
gonna happen right now.</i>

35
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:37,793
<i>Don't get in my way.</i>

36
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:40,172
<i>I'm balls to the wall,</i> <i>
going all out.</i>

37
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:42,896
I've never given up on anything.</i>

38
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:44,896
<i>On anything I've done,</i> <i>
I've gone extra.</i>

39
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:46,344
<i>And that's what I'm doing</i> <i>
right now.</i>

40
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,034
<i>I'm fighting</i> <i>
to the bitter end.</i>

41
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:51,034
<i>
I want to show that I'm here</i> <i>
to play my game</i>

42
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:52,379
<i>and I'm here to win.</i>

43
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:55,344
<i>I can close the deal and</i> <i>
be the winner of</i> Survivor 42.

44
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:00,172
In the end, I will be wearing
theSurvivor</i> <i>tiara on my head,</i>

45
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:04,344
<i>and I will be</i> <i>
the ultimate Mr.</i> Survivor.

46
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:06,206
<i>
There's nothing</i> <i>
that's gonna stop me.</i>

47
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:08,517
<i>At the end of the day,</i> <i>
everyone will know</i>

48
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:11,000
<i>that Jonathan gave</i> <i>
everything that he had.</i>

49
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:17,724
<i>There's gonna be</i> <i>
a battle royale.</i>

50
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,586
<i>
This is a big game.</i> <i>
I have to be a big player.</i>

51
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,862
<i>
My goal is to win</i> Survivor.

52
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:22,172
<i>
The million dollars is mine.</i>

53
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:23,241
<i>
I don't want to be</i>

54
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:25,172
<i>second or third,</i> <i>
and I'm gonna take it all.</i>

55
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,896
<i>
After Omar was voted out,</i>

56
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:55,034
<i>everybody was</i> <i>
just smiling and laughing.</i>

57
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:58,517
Everyone's just happy
we've made it to the final five.

58
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:00,655
<i>And then we come to find out</i>

59
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,172
<i>that we are now</i> <i>
at a brand-new beach.</i>

60
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:14,758
Holy crap. I don't know
where we are, but this is it.

61
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:16,482
This is our home.

62
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:18,586
There's all our clothes.

63
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,965
Well, at least
we got a machete and a pot.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,275
This is bizarre.
Is there more to look at?

65
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:25,689
I think this is it, guys.

66
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,413
We don't even have our tarp.

67
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:28,827
We're back at scratch.

68
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:29,896
Yeah.

69
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:31,413
Good news is,
we have only three days.

70
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:34,896
<i>
This new beach has nothing.</i>

71
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,206
<i>We don't have a tarp,</i>

72
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:38,862
<i>we don't have a shelter,</i> <i>
but you know what?</i>

73
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,724
<i>I was on cloud nine</i>

74
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:42,482
<i>because, by voting out Omar,</i>

75
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:45,448
now everybody on the jury knows

76
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:47,827
Maryanne is here to play.

77
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:51,172
<i>I might actually have a chance</i> <i>
to make it to the end</i>

78
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:52,172
<i>and win this thing.</i>

79
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:54,827
And I haven't felt like that
this whole game.

80
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:56,655
<i>It's all coming together.</i>

81
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:57,689
Listen,

82
00:03:57,724 --> 00:03:59,379
I have no hard feelings,
but I just want to know,

83
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:03,655
what did Omar tell you
to convince you to vote for me?

84
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,206
I never talked to Omar.

85
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:07,827
You weren't the plan.

86
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:09,275
Well, you voted for me.

87
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,034
I know, but I want
to hear what made you

88
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,448
pick Omar first.
So that's why...

89
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,655
Yeah, we-we, uh, we planned Omar
for a little bit.

90
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:19,862
Okay, and I'm your--
I'm in your alliance,

91
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:21,000
and I was unaware of that.

92
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:23,034
You voted for me, Lindsay.

93
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,103
But you already backed up
on your alliance,

94
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:27,000
because I'm supposed to be
aligned with you. And you...

95
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,586
So was Omar.

96
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,137
- You just... Well, you backed...
- You voted for me.

97
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,965
<i>
I'm so pissed.</i>

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,172
Now I have to deal with
the stupid wrath of Jonathan

99
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:38,620
being all righteous of like,
"You voted for me.

100
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,793
<i>You are the one</i> <i>
who are in the wrong."</i>

101
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,793
Like, dude, screw you.

102
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:44,620
If you're telling me Omar
was the plan the whole time,

103
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:46,482
and I'm in your alliance,
you didn't tell me that.

104
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:48,413
<i>That means you lied to me, too.</i>

105
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:50,689
I think I've been
getting played this whole time.

106
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,551
No. You voted for me, Lindsay.
You're forgetting.

107
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:56,206
<i>
I can't stand</i> <i>
how he talks to me.</i>

108
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:58,758
I'm frustrated
that I have to kiss his ass

109
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,724
<i>and grovel,</i>

110
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,827
<i>just for the sake of getting</i> <i>
through the next few days.</i>

111
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:05,551
And just this cockiness
that he now has

112
00:05:05,586 --> 00:05:07,965
just drives me
up a frickin' wall.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,034
I voted for you because
Omar pinned me against you.

114
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:13,034
But if I,
but if I knew the truth,

115
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,206
I wouldn't have...

116
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:16,206
<i>[groans]</i> <i>
He's impossible</i>

117
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:17,206
to talk to.

118
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,551
He's just so frickin' righteous,

119
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,172
and it drives me insane.

120
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:23,275
Well, since we're all
being honest here,

121
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,206
I have an idol, and I'm using it
in the next Tribal,

122
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,793
so at least I get to final four.

123
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,275
If you guys want to vote me out
after, that's fine.

124
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,655
Good for you, man.
Good for you.

125
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,068
You're playing your game.

126
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:33,724
<i>
I'm here</i> <i>
by the skin of my teeth.</i>

127
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:37,068
<i>They should just name me</i> <i>
- "The In-
- Case Survivor,"</i>

128
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,758
<i>because every time there's</i> <i>
a plan to vote somebody off,</i>

129
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:42,137
somebody's always gonna
throw votes on Romeo.

130
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:44,896
Just in case that person plays
an idol, Romeo goes home.

131
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:48,689
<i>So I thought the only way</i> <i>
that I can survive</i>

132
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,620
<i>the next Tribal Council</i> <i>
is to come up with this lie,</i>

133
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:55,310
which is to say that I have
a hidden immunity idol.

134
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah.

135
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:02,379
<i>They seem to buy it,</i> <i>
but just to be sure,</i>

136
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,034
<i>I made a fake idol.</i>

137
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:06,482
And, uh, I came up
with this little baby.

138
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:08,758
See?

139
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:10,413
<i>I think I did pretty good.</i>

140
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:13,344
<i>I suck at arts and crafts,</i> <i>
so my second grade teacher</i>

141
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,965
would be very proud of me.

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,172
<i>And, uh, hopefully it'll get me
through another Tribal Council.</i>

143
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:37,310
Yeah.

144
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,586
Mm-hmm.

145
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,482
I want you.
I literally want you to win.

146
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,551
<i>And, like,</i> <i>
Mike gave me his word.</i>

147
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:55,827
He said, "If I'm here at five,
I'll give you the idol."

148
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:58,862
It will be
a two-three-two vote on Omar.

149
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,448
Then he's out.
- Yeah.

150
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:01,931
- Here's my promise to you, my giveback.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

151
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:03,931
I'm the only one with an idol left.
- Yeah.

152
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,517
- I will either give it to you if you want it...
- Yeah.

153
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,586
...or play it for you.

154
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,103
- I got your back.
- Yeah.

155
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,206
- I give you my word, you'll be in the final four.
- Okay.

156
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:17,206
<i>
I'm in the worst position</i> <i>
I could possibly be in.</i>

157
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,379
<i>Romeo claims he has an idol.</i>

158
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:22,724
<i>Mike has an idol, and he's</i> <i>
never gonna turn on Jonathan.</i>

159
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:25,413
<i>And they're obviously gonna take</i> <i>
Maryanne to the end over me.</i>

160
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:27,448
<i>So if I don't win immunity</i> <i>
today,</i>

161
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:28,689
I'm definitely going home.

162
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:38,103
I don't know about that.

163
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,965
Yeah, but you're not
gonna play that for me.

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,482
I know that every...
everyone wants me out.

165
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:47,000
<i>Mike is saying that he might</i> <i>
play his idol for me,</i>

166
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,413
but he told Maryanne he would
give her the idol at five.

167
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,655
<i>So I'm like, "Don't lie to me."</i>

168
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,275
I appreciate that.

169
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,344
Please don't.

170
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,172
I'm not. Look at me.
I'm not.

171
00:07:58,206 --> 00:07:59,586
Listen, it's okay. Come here.

172
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,586
My vote's Romeo.

173
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:16,241
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

174
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,689
I'm not.

175
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:22,000
<i>I'm trying to stay positive,
but if something doesn't happen,</i>

176
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,689
<i>I feel like I'm screwed.</i>

177
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:29,793
Yes.

178
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:32,206
Whoa! Tree mail. Yeah.

179
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,275
"Another shot at immunity.

180
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,172
"Final four
is just one vote away.

181
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:40,724
"If you want
to increase your chances,

182
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:43,241
the riddle shows you the way."

183
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,241
One for you, Lindsay.

184
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,827
One for you, Mike.

185
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:51,172
<i>We get tree mail today, knowing
that it's a final five immunity,</i>

186
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:54,206
<i>but we also get a little</i> <i>
envelope that's saying</i>

187
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:56,655
"Final Advantage Clue."
And we're all like...

188
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:01,000
"First you must
unscramble the words,

189
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:02,551
"then decipher the phrase.

190
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:04,517
"You cannot search
for the advantage until

191
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:08,793
you have correctly solved and
written down the entire phrase."

192
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:10,965
<i>
Tree mail was a word scramble</i>

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,241
<i>to figure out a riddle,</i>

194
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:15,965
<i>which would tell us</i> <i>
where to find an advantage.</i>

195
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:28,344
<i>
I suck at riddles,</i>

196
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:32,034
I suck at puzzles, so I knew
that I wasn't gonna get it.

197
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:33,620
<i>But as long as Jonathan</i>

198
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,896
<i>and Mike didn't get it,</i> <i>
I didn't really care.</i>

199
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,827
I mean, get it, Lindsay.

200
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:39,551
<i>Go for it.</i>

201
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:42,137
Luckily,
I'm good at word scrambles,

202
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:43,206
and I'm good at riddles.

203
00:09:54,758 --> 00:09:55,931
What you got?
- Okay.

204
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:02,172
<i>
The riddle, it was</i>

205
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:03,896
<i>"Good fortune is tucked</i>

206
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:05,379
<i>in the toes</i> <i>
of the sleeping giant."</i>

207
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:08,620
<i>So I ran around like a banshee.</i>

208
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,137
I was everywhere on this island.

209
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:20,827
A sleeping giant. Tree's giant.
Sleeping means it fell.

210
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:25,862
<i>I ran all around every</i> <i>
single path on this island.</i>

211
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:31,655
<i>I'm definitely on the hot seat,</i> <i>
for sure,</i>

212
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,586
<i>so I need this advantage.</i>

213
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,689
<i>But I looked everywhere,</i> <i>
and nothing.</i>

214
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,793
I got "giant" for this word.

215
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,827
I got "toes." What do you got
for the first word?

216
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:50,827
"Tucked."

217
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:54,241
"Tucked... in... the... toes...

218
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,137
of the 'blank.'"

219
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,862
We need to figure that one out.

220
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:00,482
<i>
Lindsay scrambled</i> <i>
and she runs away.</i>

221
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:01,896
But then Mike's like,
"Hey, yeah, guys,

222
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:04,172
let's all work together."
And I'm like, "Ugh!"

223
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,724
Like, I'm like,
"I guess I have to sandbag it,"

224
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:07,655
because I don't want

225
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:09,344
these guys to go
and find the advantage.

226
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,517
I want Lindsay
to find the advantage,

227
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:12,827
'cause I want
to go to the end with her.

228
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,344
The "P" word.

229
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,793
Dang it.

230
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,793
<i>I had to have been gone</i> <i>
for at least 40 minutes.</i>

231
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:30,551
<i>I was all along</i> <i>
the entire beach,</i>

232
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:32,413
<i>climbing up a giant rock wall.</i>

233
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:33,724
<i>I looked everywhere.</i>

234
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,241
Nothing really stood out,
didn't see it.

235
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,827
And then I thought
that that dead tree

236
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,413
would be a sleeping giant.

237
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,241
I don't know what else
would be some giant landmark

238
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:41,241
that sticks out.

239
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:43,517
And that's where I'm stuck.

240
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:56,931
Giant trees. Giant boulders.

241
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:12,034
Oh, my God.

242
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,655
Aw, man.

243
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,448
"Congratulations.

244
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:25,896
In..."

245
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:29,206
"In a season where
you had to earn everything,

246
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:31,241
"you have a slight advantage
in today's immunity challenge.

247
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:33,000
Good luck."

248
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:34,793
I thought I was going home. Like...

249
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:39,034
<i>to have this and to earn my way</i> <i>
to the final four on my own</i>

250
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:41,379
<i>and not have to rely on anybody,</i> <i>
like, this is huge.</i>

251
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,068
Did you get it?

252
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:47,689
<i>So Lindsay came back into camp,</i>

253
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:49,137
and she had the advantage.

254
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:51,103
<i>And I was ecstatic for her.</i>

255
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,172
"Congratulations.

256
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,793
"In a season where you had

257
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:55,034
"you will have

00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:56,344
in today's immunity challenge.
Good luck."

259
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,379
Nice.

260
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:59,310
<i>
As much as I don't like</i>

261
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:02,103
<i>the spot that I'm in,</i> <i>
I do have faith in myself.</i>

262
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:03,965
Like, I have
so much fire under my ass.

263
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,241
That résumé
is looking mighty fine.

264
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,034
<i>I have nothing else to lose,</i> <i>
so screw it.</i>

265
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:10,965
Savagery is what's
gonna happen right now.

266
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,586
And I'm balls to the wall,

267
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,827
<i>going all out to win this today.</i>

268
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:45,103
Come on in.

269
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:48,275
Hell yeah.
- Yes.

270
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:53,517
Come on,
how cool is this challenge?

271
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:54,551
This looks amazing.
- Badass.

272
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,275
Pretty epic.
- Yes!

273
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,344
I was dreaming for
a station challenge.

274
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,344
Dreaming!

275
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,551
Hell yeah.

276
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:07,862
All right. Shall we get

277
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:09,827
to your final five
immunity challenge?

278
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:11,103
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

279
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:13,137
Lindsay,
come to take the necklace.

280
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:16,000
This is amazing.

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,689
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

282
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:23,137
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

283
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:24,689
<i>For today's challenge,</i> <i>
you're gonna race</i>

284
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:25,931
<i>through a series of obstacles,</i>

285
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,551
<i>collecting puzzle pieces</i> <i>
along the way.</i>

286
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:30,034
<i>Once you have all the pieces,</i>

287
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,344
<i>you're gonna use them</i> <i>
to solve a circular puzzle.</i>

288
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:37,551
First to finish wins immunity,

289
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,172
guaranteed a spot
in the final four,

290
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:40,896
which means, at the very least,

291
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:43,482
you'll be making fire
to get to three.

292
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:45,379
In addition, today
you're playing for a reward.

293
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:47,137
Want to know what you're playing for?

294
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.
First to finish will enjoy, back at camp,

295
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:52,448
- pasta.
- No. You guessed it.

296
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,034
- You guessed it.
- Spaghetti.

297
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,137
Garlic bread.

298
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:56,344
Garlic bread?

299
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:57,620
You want some meat sauce?

300
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:58,862
Yes.
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

301
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,103
- Yes!
- Yes.

302
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:02,448
- How about some cake?
- Yes!
- Yeah!

303
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:04,172
- Little salad?
- Yes!
- Yes!

304
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:06,137
- And red wine.
- Yeah!

305
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,517
Get your buzz on.

306
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:12,965
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody

307
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,758
will be voted out of this game
and fall this short.

308
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:18,206
Come this close.

309
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:19,310
It won't happen.

310
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:21,241
Big stakes.

311
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:22,689
- Get to it? Yes, sir.
- Yeah!

312
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:24,689
All right.
Jeff, I also have an advantage

313
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,000
I would like to tell you about.

314
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,586
Tell me.
All right.

315
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,000
I solved a riddle,

316
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:33,620
and I gained a final advantage,

317
00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:36,275
which says that I will have

318
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,758
a slight advantage
in today's immunity challenge.

319
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,896
Yes. Okay, so here's how
it's gonna work.

320
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:44,689
Lindsay, while everybody else
will have to untie six knots

321
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:46,241
at every station...

322
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:49,137
...you will untie one knot.

323
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,517
- Nice!
- Wow.

324
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:51,482
It's a big advantage.

325
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,586
Should get you here
to the puzzle first.

326
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,000
- Then it's on you. All right.
- Cool.

327
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:57,275
Take your spots. We'll get
started. Good luck, everybody.

328
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,310
Yeah!
Nice.

329
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,827
All right, here we go.

330
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,379
For a guaranteed spot
in the final four.

331
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:05,896
Survivors ready.

332
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,172
Go!

333
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:12,517
This challenge is on.

334
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,275
Lindsay with the big advantage.

335
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,413
She has one knot,

336
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:18,586
which means
she should start getting

337
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,206
on these obstacles
faster than anybody else.

338
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:24,689
But Jonathan gets there first.

339
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,758
Lindsay is right behind.

340
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:32,689
Lindsay's back. Jonathan's back.

341
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:33,862
Got to put it on the nail.

342
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:36,620
There you go.
Jonathan heading back out.

343
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,206
Lindsay heading back out.

344
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:41,655
Mike struggling.

345
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,793
That's a tough one.

346
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:45,172
Some of these
are a little easier.

347
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:47,310
Some are very difficult.

348
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,862
Everybody's got to do
all of 'em.

349
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,862
Romeo through the first
obstacle. He's back.

350
00:16:57,896 --> 00:17:00,517
Mike with his first bag.

351
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:02,448
Jonathan back
with his second bag.

352
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:06,000
Here comes Lindsay, struggling.

353
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:08,000
She's got the rope.
She's across.

354
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:10,551
You're good.
Lindsay with her second bag.

355
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:15,310
Jonathan's
got his six knots undone.

356
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,137
Wow! That was quick.

357
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,000
Jonathan is on fire.

358
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:24,000
Third bag.

359
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:25,620
Ripping through this.

360
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,586
Mike's back with another bag.

361
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:33,827
Lindsay's across.
Tearing up those knees.

362
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:35,310
Come on, Maryanne.

363
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:36,862
- Keep digging.
- Okay.

364
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:39,103
Drop those planks when you're done.
- Okay.

365
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:41,965
Here comes Romeo.

366
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:44,103
Maryanne's across.

367
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:46,034
Here comes Jonathan.

368
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:51,379
Lindsay's across, quickly.

369
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:53,655
There you go.
Another bag for Lindsay.

370
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:59,137
Here comes Mike,
one rope at a time, hanging on.

371
00:17:59,172 --> 00:18:01,482
Jonathan using those planks.

372
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:03,379
On his feet, not even crawling.

373
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:04,724
It's a lot of balance.

374
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:06,172
That is dangerous.

375
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:07,413
He's going for it.

376
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:09,379
Here comes Romeo.
He's going again.

377
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,551
Mike's across.
He's got another bag.

378
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:15,448
Maryanne, back on her hands and knees,

379
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:17,586
taking on
another tough obstacle.

380
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:20,206
Here comes Lindsay.

381
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:21,586
She's now in the lead.

382
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,517
Lindsay with one bag left.

383
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:25,758
Here comes Romeo.
He's got another bag.

384
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:28,310
Jonathan back with another bag.

385
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:30,793
Jonathan down to two bags left.
Here goes Lindsay.

386
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:34,862
Lindsay with her sixth
and final bag.

387
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,517
Maryanne is back
with another bag.

388
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,379
Jonathan heading
back with his fifth bag.

389
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:44,448
Wow!

390
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:47,000
Jonathan ripped
through that obstacle.

391
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:53,448
Lindsay drops.
Got to go back and start again.

392
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:54,896
And that is a big setback.

393
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:58,448
That will eat up the advantage
she had from this morning.

394
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,965
Mike with his fourth bag.

395
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,931
Here comes Romeo,

396
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:08,482
balancing,
reaching for that rope.

397
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:12,068
Here comes Mike.

398
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:14,586
Mike banging up those knees
to get here fast.

399
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,655
You're good, Mike.

400
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:20,206
Romeo with another bag.

401
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:24,310
Jonathan is eating
this challenge up right now.

402
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,137
- Here comes Maryanne, Jonathan. Little collision.
- Oh.

403
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:29,586
That's how you do it
on <i>Survivor.</i>

404
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,758
Jonathan back with all his bags.

405
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:35,620
Jonathan first to the puzzle.
Start working on it.

406
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,517
Lindsay's back now.

407
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:42,241
She can start working
on her puzzle.

408
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:44,206
It is Jonathan and Lindsay.

409
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:46,551
A very familiar sight
in challenges.

410
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,413
These two showing down
next to each other.

411
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:51,517
Here comes Romeo.

412
00:19:51,551 --> 00:19:53,379
He's fighting to stay in this.

413
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:56,137
Romeo with his fifth.
He's got one left.

414
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:00,586
Maryanne's back
with another bag.

415
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:05,206
Mike is back.

416
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:07,137
He can start
working on the puzzle.

417
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:09,862
Lindsay trying to get a piece.

418
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:11,931
Jonathan trying
to find a piece.

419
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:14,206
This is a difficult puzzle,
as you would expect

420
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:17,034
on day 24 and final five.

421
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:20,103
Romeo, drop those planks.
Let's go!

422
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:23,620
Maryanne with her final bag.
You're good.

423
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,000
We're going to have everybody
on the puzzle on day 24.

424
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,931
Five players left.

425
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:32,862
One's going to be guaranteed
a spot in the final four.

426
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:36,862
Lindsay off to a fast start
on the puzzle.

427
00:20:36,896 --> 00:20:38,586
Jonathan right there with her.

428
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,586
It is very close right now.

429
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,655
Mike would like to get in it
with his first piece.

430
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:46,103
Jonathan with another piece.

431
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:50,793
It is Jonathan and Lindsay
almost identical puzzles.

432
00:20:50,827 --> 00:20:54,275
It's been one of the best
matchups we've seen on <i>Survivor.</i>

433
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,827
Often coming down
to Lindsay and Jonathan.

434
00:20:57,862 --> 00:21:01,275
But Mike, Maryanne and Romeo
would like to change that up.

435
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,689
Spoiler. Spoiler. Yeah.

436
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:07,793
Mike with another piece.

437
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:10,068
It is Mike now in the lead.

438
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,689
Jonathan and Lindsay
trying to keep up.

439
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,655
Lindsay finds one that fits.

440
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:19,758
It is now Lindsay and Mike,
with Jonathan

441
00:21:19,793 --> 00:21:22,275
and Maryanne trailing.

442
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,344
Romeo right where he started.

443
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:27,586
- Nothing.
- I suck at puzzles, Jeff.

444
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,931
Don't say that.
You always have a chance, Romeo.

445
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:34,310
Jonathan's been stuck
in the same spot for a while.

446
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,724
Lindsay with another piece.

447
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:40,793
Mike with another piece.

448
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:43,103
A little momentum going now.

449
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:45,517
Lindsay right on his tail.

450
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:51,172
Mike with another piece,
extending his lead.

451
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:54,965
Mike can feel it now.

452
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,827
He can see it starting
to come together.

453
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:00,448
Now he's got the outside
of the circle complete.

454
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:01,931
It's just the guts.

455
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:03,517
Lindsay with another piece.

456
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:06,344
Lindsay is still in this.
This is not over.

457
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:08,689
This is Mike and Lindsay
right now.

458
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:16,482
Mike has the advantage.
And another piece by Mike.

459
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:18,034
Lindsay trying to find one.

460
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:19,965
It's a big one.
Does it fit?

461
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,448
It does.
Lindsay with another piece.

462
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,137
Mike being very careful
with that puzzle.

463
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:31,275
You get too aggressive,
it could fall apart.

464
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,655
Meanwhile,
Lindsay picking up the pace.

465
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:35,413
She's got another piece.

466
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:40,275
Mike has been on the same piece
for a long time,

467
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,413
trying to get it in there

468
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:45,103
without knocking anything over.
That's opening the door

469
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:49,310
for Lindsay, and she is
taking advantage of it.

470
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,517
Mike's got it in.

471
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:54,517
Lindsay's now the one
losing time,

472
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:57,206
trying to wedge a piece in.

473
00:22:57,241 --> 00:23:01,068
Mike with another piece.
He's down to five pieces.

474
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,655
Lindsay now starting
to fall apart.

475
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,689
It's losing its shape.

476
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:09,931
She can feel it.

477
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:12,620
That's a scary spot.

478
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:17,310
Lindsay's got it in.

479
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:20,034
She's back in business.
Got to pick up the pace again.

480
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:22,482
Lindsay with another piece.

481
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:25,551
Lindsay with another piece.

482
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:27,206
We are dead even right now.

483
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,517
Mike and Lindsay--
five pieces each.

484
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,827
Both trying to wedge a piece in.

485
00:23:32,862 --> 00:23:34,827
Mike has his piece in.
Mike is down

486
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:38,172
to four now.
Lindsay now down
to four pieces.

487
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:40,896
Michael with another piece.
This couldn't be any closer.

488
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:42,310
Mike with another piece.

489
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:44,344
He's down to two pieces.

490
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:46,413
Lindsay with another piece.

491
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:50,137
This could come down to seconds
between Mike and Lindsay.

492
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:52,517
Mike's got another piece.

493
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:56,172
He's down to his last piece, but
he's got to get it in without

494
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:59,034
destroying everything else,
and that will take a second.

495
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:00,896
Mike working it.

496
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:04,689
He's using his whole body
to hold the puzzle together,

497
00:24:04,724 --> 00:24:08,103
which is what you have to do.
Lindsay down to two pieces.

498
00:24:08,137 --> 00:24:10,103
Lindsay has another piece.

499
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:13,344
- Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!
- Mike has it!

500
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:16,103
- Yes! Yes!
- Mike pulls it out by one piece!

501
00:24:16,137 --> 00:24:17,896
Come on! Jeff!

502
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:19,827
Mike going to the final four!
- Yeah!

503
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:22,241
What a finish. Wow.
- Yeah!

504
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:24,103
I've been waiting 21 years
for this.

505
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:27,482
Whoa. One piece away, Lindsay.

506
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:30,172
Man, my kids are going
to be proud right now.

507
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:33,482
Holy crap, Jeff. Wow.

508
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:36,000
I've been waiting 21 years
for this.

509
00:24:39,482 --> 00:24:41,586
Jeff, look at it.

510
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,931
- That's good, right?
- Look at that.

511
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:44,275
- Look at that.
- Those are points in Hoboken.

512
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,689
- In Hoboken, those are points.
- Those are points.

513
00:24:45,724 --> 00:24:48,000
Those are well-earned <i>
Survivor</i> scars.

514
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:49,034
This is what you got right here.

515
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:53,517
Oh, I bet they are.
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah.

516
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:55,896
- My man!
- 21 years.

517
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,758
Yeah. Badass.
- So tell me about that.

518
00:24:57,793 --> 00:25:00,620
Because it... You can just
say that, but that means,

519
00:25:00,655 --> 00:25:02,068
from season one,
you've been watching.

520
00:25:02,103 --> 00:25:03,655
Season one,
I watched in the firehouse.

521
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:07,931
And for me to be here now
standing with Jeff Probst with

522
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,275
an immunity necklace
around my neck,

523
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,551
again
with these great competitors,

524
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:14,034
- and I'm sitting up here at the end?
- You killed it.

525
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:15,655
- Give me a hug. Thank you, man.
- You got it, man.

526
00:25:15,689 --> 00:25:17,482
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

527
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,068
Here's where things stand.

528
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:21,620
You are guaranteed a spot
in final four.

529
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:23,034
That means,
at the very least,

530
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:24,965
you're making fire
for a shot at three.

531
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,482
Jonathan, Maryanne,
Romeo, Lindsay,

532
00:25:27,517 --> 00:25:30,241
tonight one of you--
the dream will end.

533
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:33,586
You'll go to the jury.
It will not be you. You've also

534
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,068
- earned pasta.
- I forgot about that.

535
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:38,241
- Yeah. Garlic bread, cake.
- Oh, my God.

536
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:41,137
Choose one person to join you.

537
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,655
So think
about what you're doing.

538
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:47,586
You're fueling your competition
or you're buying favor.

539
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,965
Actually, I'm deciding
about buying favor.

540
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,034
There's somebody here
that's been dizzy every day.

541
00:25:52,068 --> 00:25:54,758
He started at 250.
He's down to, like, 210.

542
00:25:54,793 --> 00:25:56,448
He's got nothing left
in the tank.

543
00:25:56,482 --> 00:25:58,413
And I love you guys.
I just think, right now,

544
00:25:58,448 --> 00:25:59,965
he hasn't had a reward in a while.
Of course.

545
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,586
And I got to bring Jonathan.

546
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,758
I love you, bro.

547
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,310
Jonathan will be joining...

548
00:26:04,344 --> 00:26:06,448
- Want to give me another one?
- No.

549
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,586
- Okay. All right.
- That's it.

550
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,551
Maryanne, Romeo, Lindsay,
got nothing for you.

551
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:11,551
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

552
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:13,241
- See you tonight at Tribal.
- Thank you.

553
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:15,379
Thank you. Oh.

554
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:18,241
<i>
Ugh! So close!</i>

555
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:18,689
<i>Being</i>

556
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:20,793
one piece away?

557
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:24,206
<i>It just sucks, but I'm not going</i> <i>
to quit. I'm not going</i>

558
00:26:24,241 --> 00:26:26,793
to stop playing because
people don't want me there.

559
00:26:26,827 --> 00:26:28,827
<i>Screw that.</i> <i>
I'm making it to the end,</i>

560
00:26:28,862 --> 00:26:30,896
<i>and I'll apologize later.</i>

561
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:54,620
- Thank you.
- Look at this!

562
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:58,448
- Thank you, God, and thank you, Mike. Ah!
- Oh, my God.

563
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:00,137
Vanilla cake.

564
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:02,620
Oh, Mike, give me a hug!

565
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,310
Ah!

566
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:06,862
Holy crap.

567
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:09,068
I was one piece.

568
00:27:09,103 --> 00:27:10,896
I had one piece left.

569
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:12,310
Jonathan didn't even
keep doing the puzzle.

570
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:15,000
He just watched Mike do it.
Like, such a cocky ass.

571
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,448
Cheers to our brotherhood.

572
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:18,000
History will be made with us.

573
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:20,068
There are good ships,
there are bad ships,

574
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:22,517
but there are no ships
like friendships.

575
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:24,068
That's a good one.
That's a good one.

576
00:27:24,103 --> 00:27:26,034
<i>
And to just have him,</i> <i>
like, be able</i>

577
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:29,482
to gloat about me leaving
before him just, like, irks me

578
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,827
because I'm a way better player
than Jonathan.

579
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:34,344
Mmm.

580
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:35,689
Today at the immunity challenge,</i>

581
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:37,517
<i>I won this necklace.</i>

582
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:39,068
<i>I'm playing against</i>

583
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:40,517
kids that are 30 years younger
than me.

584
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:41,965
Two of them have been

585
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,379
<i>immunity beasts.</i>

586
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,413
<i>And Lindsay had</i> <i>
a distinct advantage today,</i>

587
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:50,896
<i>and I still won immunity,</i> <i>
and it feels unbelievable.</i>

588
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:52,793
I have a little bit of power.

589
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:54,310
You have a lot of power,
brother. Come on, dude.

590
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:55,862
<i>
I have immunity.</i>

591
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:58,034
<i>Plus, I have an idol</i> <i>
in my pocket.</i>

592
00:27:58,068 --> 00:28:00,965
<i>Now I got to figure out</i> <i>
what I'm gonna do with it,</i>

593
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,724
which I'm not exactly sure yet.

594
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:05,724
<i>I just know that I'm gonna</i> <i>
play it for somebody and take</i>

595
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:08,034
who I want to the final four.

596
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:09,137
Romeo's saying he has an idol.

597
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,068
We got to take away
our biggest threat.

598
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,448
<i>
The plan tonight is</i> <i>
to get Lindsay out.</i>

599
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:21,241
<i>She is an absolute beast.</i>

600
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:23,206
<i>She's really good at puzzles.</i>

601
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:25,068
She's physically strong.

602
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,551
She's got a good head
on her shoulders. She talks.

603
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:29,724
<i>So she's somebody</i> <i>
that you don't want</i>

604
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:32,206
<i>to be sitting by</i> <i>
in the final three.</i>

605
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,448
I just feel like
they're coming after me, Mike,

606
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:36,068
'cause you know they're talking
about me right now.

607
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:38,793
Of course they are, but, dude,
you're not going home tonight.

608
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:43,310
- I got one favor to ask of you.
- Uh-huh.

609
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:46,310
If she pulls an idol,
will you play it on me?

610
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,344
That would help.

611
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:53,068
So give me... give me your word
right now, please.

612
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:55,586
I don't have to save you. I
swear on this. I'm telling you.

613
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,586
Okay.

614
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,310
<i>
I don't know how the hell</i>

615
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:00,620
I'm gonna make it out of here.

616
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,689
He's gonna give his idol to Jon.

617
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:02,896
Exactly.
No.

618
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,137
He gave me his word.

619
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:07,620
He gave me his word
about stuff, too,

620
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:08,965
and it means nothing.

621
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,862
<i>
Today was a challenge</i>

622
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:14,896
that I absolutely needed to win.

623
00:29:14,931 --> 00:29:16,517
<i>So now the only possible way</i>

624
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:19,586
<i>that I'm going</i> <i>
to get through this is to</i>

625
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,448
vote for Jonathan--
all three of us--

626
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:22,896
<i>and hope that Mike</i>

627
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:25,586
<i>gives his idol</i> <i>
to either myself or Maryanne.</i>

628
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,448
He gave me his word that he
would play his idol for me.

629
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:30,620
Did he give you the same word?

630
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:32,793
He kind of said it to me
on the beach that he might.

631
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:34,172
He didn't guarantee it.

632
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,068
I really, truly do think

633
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:38,068
Jonathan won't be here tomorrow.

634
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:40,103
I have faith.

635
00:29:40,137 --> 00:29:42,103
<i>
Maryanne is</i> <i>
extremely confident that</i>

636
00:29:42,137 --> 00:29:44,344
Mike is going
to play his immunity idol

637
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:47,379
<i>for her,</i> <i>
but I can't rely on that.</i>

638
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:50,413
<i>So my plan is to pitch</i> <i>
to Mike hard</i>

639
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:53,344
to make him feel
extremely guilty

640
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:56,655
<i>that he'd be breaking his word</i> <i>
if he didn't pick me.</i>

641
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:05,413
So, I'm just begging

642
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:08,206
to not go home.

643
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:11,793
I valued how much
that you feel like your word,

644
00:30:11,827 --> 00:30:14,517
as long as someone shows trust
back, you show trust to them.

645
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:17,620
I feel like I very much
earned that with the trust

646
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:19,206
that I've given you.

647
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:20,689
We had a bond--
you, me, and Omar--

648
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:22,689
we're going
to make it to the end.

649
00:30:22,724 --> 00:30:25,862
Omar burned you,
but I stayed true to my word,

650
00:30:25,896 --> 00:30:29,275
and you saying to me,
"I would love to see you get

651
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,034
- to the end."
- That's still true.

652
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:33,034
- But you have the power of that.
- I know. Yeah.

653
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:35,862
So if I leave,
then it makes me feel

654
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:38,724
that that was a lie.

655
00:30:38,758 --> 00:30:41,413
It's not a lie.
I still feel that way.

656
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:44,172
<i>Honestly, I love Lindsay.</i>

657
00:30:44,206 --> 00:30:45,862
<i>I think she's a great girl.</i> <i>
I really do.</i>

658
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:47,379
<i>I see my own daughter in her.</i>

659
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:48,896
I think she got caught up
in the wrong place

660
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,517
and with the wrong person.

661
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:52,758
<i>Other than that,</i> <i>
she's been loyal to me.</i>

662
00:30:52,793 --> 00:30:54,620
<i>But on the other hand, it's fair</i>

663
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:56,448
that I protect Jonathan
'cause he protected me,

664
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:59,103
<i>and Maryanne has been a person</i> <i>
of good character.</i>

665
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:00,724
She's kept her word,

666
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,827
<i>and that means a lot to me.</i>

667
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,275
I'm gonna tell you my dilemma.

668
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,310
When that happened with Omar

669
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:08,103
- and-and you, I thought...
- Mm-hmm.

670
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:10,448
<i>
...I went to Maryanne</i> <i>
and made a promise to her.</i>

671
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:12,448
Then this is what's hard
for me, Mike,

672
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:14,724
because I feel like
I've proven myself to you

673
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:16,620
in so many ways, and now,

674
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:18,620
because you now made
a last-minute promise

675
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,655
to Maryanne, everything
that I did meant ....

676
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:22,655
No, that's not true.

677
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:24,448
Mike, look at me in my eyes.

678
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:29,172
I 100% never lied to you once.

679
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:31,724
I promise you, I swear

680
00:31:31,758 --> 00:31:33,034
- on everything.
- I believe you. Yeah.

681
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:35,000
I had your back
and told you everything.

682
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:36,068
And this is your time

683
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,655
to-to show me the trust back.

684
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,448
I'm very torn. I...

685
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,206
Honestly,
I don't have my-my mind made up.

686
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:43,758
<i>I've put myself</i> <i>
in a position where</i>

687
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:45,379
<i>I have to make a decision</i> <i>
that's going to</i>

688
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:47,103
hurt somebody,

689
00:31:47,137 --> 00:31:49,275
<i>and it sucks.</i>

690
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,275
I'm not 100% any way right now.

691
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,724
<i>But now I got to figure out</i> <i>
what's the right thing to do.</i>

692
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:09,068
Right, he's got to... You know
what, though? You're right.

693
00:32:09,103 --> 00:32:10,551
But listen.

694
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:16,000
I... Like, my mind says, like,
I think I can squeeze it out.

695
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,793
<i>Right now
Lindsay is a sitting duck, but</i>

696
00:32:19,827 --> 00:32:22,275
<i>not only do I have my idol,</i> <i>
which is</i>

697
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:26,103
the only secret that has been
kept in this entire game,

698
00:32:26,137 --> 00:32:29,758
<i>but also Mike might give</i> <i>
his idol to me at Tribal.</i>

699
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:32,758
<i>So this means that my idol--</i> <i>
I can use it to save Lindsay</i>

700
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:35,413
<i>and blindside Jonathan.</i> <i>
The question is,</i>

701
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:37,413
<i>what gives me</i> <i>
my best chance of winning?</i>

702
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:44,068
Emotionally, yes.

703
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,965
<i>
Lindsay's played</i> <i>
such a great game.</i>

704
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,344
<i>She's won immunities</i> <i>
and taken major risks,</i>

705
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:54,172
and the jury loves that.

706
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,655
<i>But voting out someone
who knows they're going home--</i>

707
00:32:56,689 --> 00:32:58,379
<i>that's not a big move.</i>

708
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:03,827
<i>
But if I play my idol</i>

709
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:05,724
<i>on Lindsay</i> <i>
and blindside Jonathan,</i>

710
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:07,344
the jury will know
that I am here to play

711
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:08,931
and that I'm a contender.

712
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:12,482
<i>But it all comes down</i> <i>
to what Mike does,</i>

713
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:15,034
<i>and this could make</i> <i>
or break my game.</i>

714
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:55,068
Let's start this morning.

715
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:57,620
Lindsay, you wake up,
and you each have a riddle

716
00:33:57,655 --> 00:33:59,862
to solve.
Walk me through what happened.

717
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:02,793
We each get this envelope
that says,

718
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:04,931
you have
to fix the word scramble.

719
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:06,724
Once you figure that out,

720
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:08,413
you're off to the races
to solve the riddle

721
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:09,758
and find a secret advantage.

722
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:11,827
And I was the only one

723
00:34:11,862 --> 00:34:13,896
who solved the riddle.

724
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:15,931
- I-I had to have been gone for at least 40 minutes.
- At least.

725
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:18,206
Jonathan, it's got
to be frustrating

726
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:19,655
because it's an advantage.

727
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:21,413
It's offering you something
in the game

728
00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:22,793
if you can just solve it.

729
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,206
Yeah, that's the thing.

730
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:27,758
I haven't felt normal
in days, Mr. Jeff,

731
00:34:27,793 --> 00:34:29,655
because of how hard
this has been.

732
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:31,344
It took four people.

733
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,034
- Yeah.
- No, we didn't get it.
- And we still didn't get it.

734
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:34,517
No, Lindsay had
to come back and tell us.

735
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:36,620
Yeah. We said... we said,
"Lindsay, can you tell us

736
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:38,344
what it was?" She's like,
"Well, yeah, I got it now."

737
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:39,793
- It was "sleeping."
- It was "sleeping." It was "sleeping."

738
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,103
It was "sleeping."
We look at the word.

739
00:34:41,137 --> 00:34:42,310
We said, "We can't believe
it was 'sleeping.'"

740
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:44,344
So, Lindsay, you get

741
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:45,896
the advantage, but did you feel,

742
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:47,241
going into the challenge,

743
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:50,000
that that advantage
would be helpful?

744
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:52,793
Absolutely. I knew
if I didn't win, I'm going home.

745
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:56,482
And I was one puzzle piece short

746
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:58,793
from beating Mike.
Super happy for Mike.

747
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:00,551
Really proud of him
that he got it.

748
00:35:00,586 --> 00:35:01,896
Just sucks
that in return of that,

749
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:03,413
I'm most likely going home.

750
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:06,103
So what's giving you
that feeling?

751
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,241
Based on last Tribal.
Everyone else,

752
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,862
apparently, already kind of knew
that Omar was working everybody.

753
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:14,137
I didn't until afterwards.

754
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:17,068
And then there was a lot
of damage control to do,

755
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:19,793
and some that wasn't able
to be repaired, it seems.

756
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,896
Jonathan, then,
what was the vibe at camp?

757
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:23,965
I thought it would be fireworks

758
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,620
with people running around
everywhere. Was it not?

759
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:28,413
Is everybody locked in
that it's Lindsay?

760
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:30,275
Uh, you can never know
for sure,

761
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,344
of course, because then
comfort sets in,

762
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:34,172
and we know that
that kills people in this game.

763
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:39,551
But people do recognize Lindsay
as a big threat, which she is.

764
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:43,310
Maryanne, what was your take
on what was going down at camp?

765
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,206
In my perspective,
I had to decide

766
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:47,448
on whether I wanted
to vote emotionally

767
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:50,103
on who I feel
I want it to be in the end,

768
00:35:50,137 --> 00:35:53,241
and strategically on who
I feel is the best combination

769
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:55,172
of people to have in the end.

770
00:35:55,206 --> 00:35:57,896
And everyone here knows that
I wear my heart on my sleeve,

771
00:35:57,931 --> 00:35:59,413
so that was something that
was difficult for me because

772
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,310
I love every single person here,
and I...

773
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:03,620
but I need to go and recognize
that, like,

774
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:05,172
I want to play this game for me,

775
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,620
and that means
that I might have

776
00:36:06,655 --> 00:36:08,517
to, like, go back on my word,
or, like, that means

777
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:11,000
that I might have to go back
on an alliance, and that sucks.

778
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:13,862
So, Lindsay, do you feel

779
00:36:13,896 --> 00:36:17,241
that you were the only one that
was openly feeling desperate?

780
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,689
- Yes.
- So that was clear to everybody?

781
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah, so it's calm

782
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:23,379
because no one has
to really make a decision.

783
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:26,758
It was more me having
to plead my case of why

784
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:29,379
I would like to stay.
I mean, on one end,

785
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:31,758
I got deceived by Omar
this entire time,

786
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:35,068
so my social game clearly sucks,
strategic game sucks, because

787
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:36,793
all I have
is my competitive edge.

788
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,551
That's only one...
That's one note.

789
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:41,413
So, in terms of fighting
against the jury,

790
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:45,137
that's not really a big case.
That's only one end of that.

791
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:46,793
No, absolutely not.
Every time Lindsay

792
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:50,655
communicates with people,
they have a bond with her.

793
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:52,965
It's not just
because you got tricked

794
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,551
that makes you
a bad social player at all.

795
00:36:55,586 --> 00:36:58,413
You're social with everyone,
and everyone loves you.

796
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:00,448
And that's the truth.

797
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:02,344
And so, Lindsay,
this is a question

798
00:37:02,379 --> 00:37:04,275
I can never figure out
what I would do.

799
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,206
How do you stop trying?
Because I'm sure, at some point,

800
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:09,413
you go, "Well, okay, I guess
that's it. But wait, Mike,

801
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:11,793
let me just... Can I...? Let me
just try it one more time."

802
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:13,310
- Is that what happened?
- That's literally what I did.

803
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,275
- That's exactly what happened. Yes.
- Okay.

804
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,586
I'm doing it right now. Like,
I have to just pitch my case

805
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,482
as best as I can.
Until you snuff that torch

806
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:22,103
and my name is up there,
I have to just hope

807
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:25,758
that I can just say one
last thing and offer one last...

808
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:27,448
I don't know. I-I don't know.

809
00:37:27,482 --> 00:37:29,931
It's like guns blazing,
whatever I have left.

810
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:31,620
I'm just throwing anything
out there.

811
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:34,413
Jonathan, how do you feel about

812
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:36,827
that aspect of the game
in this sense?

813
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:39,103
The better player you are,

814
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:41,689
the more likely
you are to be taken out.

815
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:44,172
In theory, in a lot of games,
the better player you are,

816
00:37:44,206 --> 00:37:46,620
the more likely you are to win
'cause you're better.

817
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:50,448
It's a fine line. If you aren't
a great player, then

818
00:37:50,482 --> 00:37:52,758
people want
to keep you till the end, but

819
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:55,413
if you're looked at
as too strong, then done.

820
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:57,310
Or finding the person

821
00:37:57,344 --> 00:37:59,724
or people
that you really can trust,

822
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:01,862
and they... you work together
to get to the end,

823
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:03,413
even if you're a good player,
that helps out.

824
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:07,034
But again, it is <i>Survivor.</i>
That changes quickly.

825
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:08,862
And what does that mean?

826
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,551
That you can be a good player,

827
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:12,448
and if you find
another good player

828
00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:14,103
that you trust,
then maybe the two of you bond

829
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:15,586
and you protect each other?

830
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,034
Yeah. You don't even have
to be two good players.

831
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:18,344
Just two people that really know

832
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,620
that they have
each other's back.

833
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:21,758
As long as one of them
doesn't feel

834
00:38:21,793 --> 00:38:24,827
the other one has an upper hand,
you kind of work together.

835
00:38:24,862 --> 00:38:26,827
I mean,
but it's a hard thing to find.

836
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:30,793
Well, Maryanne, the key is,
you have to align with people

837
00:38:30,827 --> 00:38:32,620
that you believe you can beat,

838
00:38:32,655 --> 00:38:34,586
and the trick is,
they're aligning with you

839
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,379
because they believe
they can beat you.

840
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:40,931
Exactly, and so many people have
tried to play that fine line

841
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:42,793
and played it a little too well.

842
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:45,103
That's truly why I think
Omar is there, because he...

843
00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:47,482
I thought I was his number one,
but then

844
00:38:47,517 --> 00:38:50,413
I realized that if I did take
my number one to the end,

845
00:38:50,448 --> 00:38:52,655
I'd be taken
and herded as a goat.

846
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:56,241
But you have to realize,
"Okay, no. I have

847
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:57,724
"to go, and I now have
to find new allies

848
00:38:57,758 --> 00:38:59,586
"who are round the same level
as me

849
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,724
so I actually have a chance
to win at the end."

850
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:05,137
So, Romeo, if you were gonna
give this vote a title,

851
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:09,689
this chapter is called what?
What's the vote about?

852
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:12,517
I would call it "The Fighter."

853
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,551
Whoever it is didn't give up.

854
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:18,827
They kept fighting till the
very end, and that's admirable.

855
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:20,827
So, Lindsay,
you think he's talking to you?

856
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:22,931
It's "Lindsay: The Fighter"?

857
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:25,068
Yeah, but I-I like that title.
I'm cool with it.

858
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:27,620
If-if the reason
for me leaving is because

859
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:29,931
no one thinks they can beat me,

860
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:32,103
that's the best way
for me to leave.

861
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:37,241
All right, well, it sounds
like it is time to vote.

862
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,310
Romeo, you're up.

863
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:14,068
All right, if anybody has
an advantage or an idol,

864
00:40:14,103 --> 00:40:17,689
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

865
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,034
Jeff.

866
00:40:24,103 --> 00:40:27,551
I waited 21 years
to do this, also.

867
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:29,413
However, I can't play it
for myself,

868
00:40:29,448 --> 00:40:31,586
but I want to repay
somebody's loyalty to me.

869
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:37,724
I'm gonna play this
for Maryanne, okay?

870
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:43,000
You deserve it. I want you
to be here tomorrow.

871
00:40:43,034 --> 00:40:45,551
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

872
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:48,758
This is a hidden immunity idol.

873
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:51,793
Any votes cast
for Maryanne will not count.

874
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,241
Jeff?

875
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:56,241
Um, I will...

876
00:40:56,275 --> 00:41:00,137
not be playing this
for myself because

877
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:01,586
it is a fake idol.

878
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,482
I made it at camp. So I'm going
to throw it in the fire.

879
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:06,068
Good for you. Good for you. Okay.

880
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:12,896
All right, I'll read the votes.

881
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:17,172
First vote-- Lindsay.

882
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:22,793
Jonathan. One vote-- Lindsay,
one vote-- Jonathan.

883
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:33,034
Lindsay. Two votes-- Lindsay,
one vote-- Jonathan.

884
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:40,517
14th person voted out
of <i>Survivor 42--</i> Lindsay.

885
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:42,862
It's three. It's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

886
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:48,000
It was fun
while it lasted, guys.

887
00:41:48,034 --> 00:41:50,413
Love you, girl.

888
00:41:54,068 --> 00:41:55,655
Good luck.

889
00:41:55,689 --> 00:41:58,172
- I love you so much.
- Good luck to you.

890
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:03,793
Ugh.

891
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:07,517
Lindsay, the tribe has spoken.

892
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:12,344
Time for you to go. Ah.

893
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:14,793
- Good luck, guys.
- Bye, Lindsay.

894
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:16,896
I'm gonna eat so much food!

895
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:19,241
Enjoy it.

896
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:28,000
All right, you've made it
to the final four.

897
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:32,931
Tomorrow you'll compete in
your final immunity challenge.

898
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:34,344
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

899
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:36,551
Good night.
Thanks, Jeff.

900
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:42,551
I love that the label's
"The Fighter," and I like

901
00:42:42,586 --> 00:42:45,172
<i>that that's my tagline
for this because I really felt</i>

902
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:47,241
<i>like I fought my way</i> <i>
throughout this whole game.</i>

903
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:49,413
<i>And I'm incredibly proud</i> <i>
of myself</i>

904
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:52,000
<i>of how far I got.</i> <i>
This was so much fun.</i>

905
00:42:52,034 --> 00:42:55,103
<i>I got to experience</i> <i>
so many</i> Survivor <i>things</i>

906
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:57,000
<i>that so many people</i> <i>
don't get to have.</i>

907
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,068
Of course,
I'm a little upset right now,

908
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:02,551
but this was the best ever.

909
00:43:22,068 --> 00:43:23,413
Come on in.

910
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:30,000
I can hear you breathing just
walking up the steps, Maryanne.

911
00:43:30,034 --> 00:43:32,344
Oh, yeah.

912
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:34,206
Good morning, Jeff.

913
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:36,551
Good morning, Mr. Jeff.

914
00:43:36,586 --> 00:43:37,793
Good morning.

915
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:39,793
Oh, wow.

916
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:42,172
It is a <i>Survivor</i> classic.

917
00:43:43,965 --> 00:43:45,896
- You know the name?
- Yes, sir.

918
00:43:45,931 --> 00:43:47,896
All right, so,
let me just check in.

919
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:50,931
How are you doing, day 25?

920
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:52,448
Mike, what are you feeling?

921
00:43:52,482 --> 00:43:54,896
Obviously we're very depleted.
It's day 25.

922
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:58,241
But I always say,
"Big games, big players."

923
00:43:58,275 --> 00:44:00,172
And that's when you reach deeper
than you've ever reached

924
00:44:00,206 --> 00:44:02,655
into everything you have
and put it out there,

925
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:04,551
and this is
the last immunity challenge.

926
00:44:04,586 --> 00:44:06,551
And whatever's left in the tank,

927
00:44:06,586 --> 00:44:09,034
you have to leave right here
on this platform today.

928
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:12,275
How about you, Romeo?
When you're about

929
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,241
to take on this challenge,
who all do you think of?

930
00:44:15,275 --> 00:44:17,413
Do you draw
on inspiration right now?

931
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:19,413
Definitely. Family back home.

932
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:23,034
All the strong, independent
women that I coach back home.

933
00:44:23,068 --> 00:44:25,137
They're looking at me
and saying, "Hang in there.

934
00:44:25,172 --> 00:44:28,517
You know, you taught me
to push for what you want."

935
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:30,517
And now I'm showing them that
I'm pushing for what I want.

936
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:32,103
I want final three.

937
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:35,379
How about you, Jonathan?
What do you draw on right now?

938
00:44:35,413 --> 00:44:39,275
We've been working this hard
for this moment, Mr. Jeff.

939
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:43,103
And for me
it comes down to this.

940
00:44:43,137 --> 00:44:46,241
And everything that I have, I'm
going to pour it into this game,

941
00:44:46,275 --> 00:44:48,034
and I'm going to give it my all

942
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:51,310
so that if I do get kicked off,
then I'll say,

943
00:44:51,344 --> 00:44:54,344
"Hey, I fought the good fight.
I did everything I could do."

944
00:44:54,379 --> 00:44:58,275
Maryanne, right now
you've been so vocal all season

945
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,620
of sharing your emotions.

946
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:02,689
You even say,
"I wear 'em on my sleeve."

947
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:04,482
What are you feeling right now?

948
00:45:04,517 --> 00:45:08,000
What are you drawing on
to get you pumped up?

949
00:45:09,068 --> 00:45:12,068
Um... right now...

950
00:45:12,103 --> 00:45:14,448
I'm sorry.

951
00:45:14,482 --> 00:45:19,448
I'm right now
drawing on knowing that

952
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:24,068
my whole family's going to be
watching me doing this, and...

953
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:26,758
one of my family members
is not talking

954
00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:28,517
to the rest of my family,

955
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:30,103
so we haven't really
been together

956
00:45:30,137 --> 00:45:31,689
for more than a year,
and it hurts.

957
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:35,103
But to know that at this moment,

958
00:45:35,137 --> 00:45:37,103
even if they're separate,

959
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:39,793
we're together right now,
cheering me on

960
00:45:39,827 --> 00:45:42,275
is the thing that's driving me
and pushing me.

961
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:46,172
So you being on <i>Survivor</i>
could bring your family back?

962
00:45:49,241 --> 00:45:51,827
I want it more
than a million dollars, Jeff.

963
00:45:53,241 --> 00:45:55,344
I want it more
than a million dollars.

964
00:45:57,068 --> 00:45:59,275
How do you now take that emotion

965
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:03,655
and turn it into energy
rather than sorrow or sadness?

966
00:46:03,689 --> 00:46:07,034
I sit in the sorrow and sadness.

967
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:10,379
It's okay to feel sad,
but the thing is,

968
00:46:10,413 --> 00:46:11,931
sadness doesn't take you anywhere.

969
00:46:11,965 --> 00:46:13,344
It's what you do with that.

970
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:15,793
What am I going to do
with my sadness?

971
00:46:15,827 --> 00:46:17,793
I'm going to turn it
into passion and drive

972
00:46:17,827 --> 00:46:21,034
so that I push myself,
and I do the best that I can,

973
00:46:21,068 --> 00:46:22,862
and I win this competition.

974
00:46:24,689 --> 00:46:26,655
All right,
all four of you feel very ready.

975
00:46:26,689 --> 00:46:28,896
You know what's driving you.

976
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:31,137
Let's get to it.
First things first, Mike.

977
00:46:31,172 --> 00:46:32,724
Jeff, you might have to wrestle
me for this. I don't know.

978
00:46:32,758 --> 00:46:34,724
- Ah, I don't want to wrestle you, man.
- Ah.

979
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,206
- I want love.
- You always get love, brother.

980
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:37,620
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

981
00:46:40,068 --> 00:46:42,034
It comes down to this, Mr. Jeff.

982
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:44,551
It comes down to this.
- Man, I'm stoked!

983
00:46:44,586 --> 00:46:46,689
Come on!

984
00:46:46,724 --> 00:46:51,206
For the last time,
immunity is back up for grabs.

985
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,758
<i>For today's challenge,</i> <i>
you're going</i>

986
00:46:52,793 --> 00:46:54,482
<i>to have one hand tied</i> <i>
behind your back.</i>

987
00:46:54,517 --> 00:46:56,931
<i>You're going
to drop a ball down the chute.</i>

988
00:46:56,965 --> 00:47:00,448
<i>It's going to spiral around.</i> <i>
You're going to catch it.</i>

989
00:47:00,482 --> 00:47:02,241
<i>You're going to drop it again.</i> <i>
At regular intervals,</i>

990
00:47:02,275 --> 00:47:05,551
<i>we will add another ball,</i> <i>
making it more difficult.</i>

991
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:08,137
<i>If at any point a ball drops,</i>

992
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:10,448
<i>you're out.</i>

993
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:13,448
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

994
00:47:13,482 --> 00:47:16,379
guaranteed a spot
at the final three

995
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:19,448
where you will get a shot
to plead your case to the jury

996
00:47:19,482 --> 00:47:21,344
that you helped vote out,

997
00:47:21,379 --> 00:47:23,448
why you deserve
the title of Sole Survivor

998
00:47:23,482 --> 00:47:24,862
and the million dollars.

999
00:47:24,896 --> 00:47:28,172
Plus, you decide,
"Who do I take with me

1000
00:47:28,206 --> 00:47:31,655
to put in that second seat, and
who do I force to make fire?"

1001
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:34,275
All the power will be
in the hands

1002
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,068
of the person
who wins this challenge.

1003
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,620
Never has a challenge been
more important

1004
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,068
in this season
than this one right here.

1005
00:47:40,103 --> 00:47:41,724
Are you ready?

1006
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,275
Yes.
- Yes, sir.
Let's get to it.

1007
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:44,758
Yes.

1008
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,896
All right, everybody pick up
your first ball.

1009
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,034
Here we go. Final four.

1010
00:47:57,068 --> 00:48:00,034
Win this, you're in three. Everybody,

1011
00:48:00,068 --> 00:48:03,137
drop your first ball.

1012
00:48:05,965 --> 00:48:09,034
This challenge is on.

1013
00:48:12,482 --> 00:48:15,655
Everything riding right here

1014
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:19,137
on this beautifully-designed,
hypnotic game.

1015
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:24,172
What started
as an art department project

1016
00:48:24,206 --> 00:48:26,655
in <i>Survivor: China</i> by somebody

1017
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:30,137
who had some free time
on his hands, named Simo,

1018
00:48:30,172 --> 00:48:33,758
turned into a challenge
that we used

1019
00:48:33,793 --> 00:48:36,586
in <i>Survivor: Tocantins,</i>
and is now worth

1020
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,724
a million dollars to somebody.

1021
00:48:38,758 --> 00:48:40,586
Right now you're just getting

1022
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,379
warmed up,
getting a feel of this.

1023
00:48:45,655 --> 00:48:48,344
Mike drops.
Mike, you're out.

1024
00:48:48,379 --> 00:48:50,586
Mike is out with one ball.

1025
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,655
Unbelievable.
Never seen that happen.

1026
00:48:54,689 --> 00:48:58,275
Mike has no control tonight.

1027
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,413
I'm still in shock. What happened?
So am I.

1028
00:49:00,448 --> 00:49:02,689
Took my eye off of it
to put it in.

1029
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:04,551
I mean,
we're in the warmup phase.

1030
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:06,655
I literally had it in my hand.

1031
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:08,758
It slipped out of my hand.

1032
00:49:11,724 --> 00:49:14,551
All right, we're down to three.

1033
00:49:14,586 --> 00:49:18,172
In a moment you're going
to add a second ball,

1034
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:21,827
and that's when this challenge
will really start to kick in.

1035
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:24,482
You'll have 15 seconds to do it.

1036
00:49:24,517 --> 00:49:27,000
You don't need to rush.

1037
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:31,724
You just saw, with Mike,
how quickly it can be over.

1038
00:49:31,758 --> 00:49:35,000
Stay engaged.

1039
00:49:35,034 --> 00:49:37,241
Your 15 seconds starts now.

1040
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:39,724
Maryanne drops.

1041
00:49:39,758 --> 00:49:41,689
Jonathan drops.

1042
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:45,965
Romeo drops.

1043
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Everybody now
with two balls in motion.

1044
00:49:51,413 --> 00:49:55,620
The key to this challenge
is that gate.

1045
00:49:55,655 --> 00:49:58,655
It's going to send one ball
to the right,

1046
00:49:58,689 --> 00:50:01,034
and then the next ball
to the left.

1047
00:50:02,068 --> 00:50:05,000
It's going to come down
to the spacing.

1048
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:19,689
That sound is hypnotic.

1049
00:50:19,724 --> 00:50:22,172
You got to stay very engaged.

1050
00:50:22,206 --> 00:50:25,068
Mike still stunned.

1051
00:50:25,103 --> 00:50:29,172
You never know what is going
to get you on <i>Survivor.</i>

1052
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:31,241
Oh, Maryanne drops.

1053
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:35,172
Maryanne is out, and now,
quickly, we are down to two.

1054
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:37,689
And we only have two balls
in play.

1055
00:50:37,724 --> 00:50:39,689
It speaks to mental exhaustion.

1056
00:50:42,034 --> 00:50:45,793
This is not a difficult phase
of this challenge.

1057
00:50:45,827 --> 00:50:47,862
Lots of kids watching
could do this.

1058
00:50:49,482 --> 00:50:51,758
But they've been sleeping
and eating.

1059
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:56,068
Mike and Maryanne--

1060
00:50:56,103 --> 00:51:00,275
their fate will be decided
by either Jonathan or Romeo.

1061
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,620
Whoever wins this challenge
will hold

1062
00:51:03,655 --> 00:51:06,793
all the power tonight
at Tribal Council.

1063
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:12,413
You're gonna get ready
to place a third ball.

1064
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:15,931
You'll have 15 seconds

1065
00:51:15,965 --> 00:51:17,172
starting now.

1066
00:51:17,206 --> 00:51:19,413
Based on what's happened so far,

1067
00:51:19,448 --> 00:51:21,862
three balls might be it.

1068
00:51:21,896 --> 00:51:23,551
Romeo drops.

1069
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:26,103
Jonathan drops, and we're now

1070
00:51:26,137 --> 00:51:27,931
into the next phase--
three balls.

1071
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:32,344
Those balls now feel like
they're spinning more quickly.

1072
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:35,413
That spacing is really critical.

1073
00:51:35,448 --> 00:51:39,655
Every part of you is focused
on one thing--

1074
00:51:39,689 --> 00:51:41,241
left, then right.

1075
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:44,137
Left, then right.

1076
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:50,344
This is it.

1077
00:51:50,379 --> 00:51:53,275
Who will have the power tonight

1078
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,965
to try to control what happens?

1079
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,896
Romeo and Jonathan,

1080
00:51:57,931 --> 00:52:01,413
if you hear a thud
of that ball hitting the plank,

1081
00:52:01,448 --> 00:52:04,172
that's going to echo
in your mind for a lifetime

1082
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:05,689
if you lose <i>Survivor.</i>

1083
00:52:10,724 --> 00:52:14,103
All right, in a moment, we're
going to add a fourth ball,

1084
00:52:14,137 --> 00:52:16,793
and it's going
to get very difficult.

1085
00:52:16,827 --> 00:52:18,965
So you need to start thinking

1086
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,827
about where you want
to put that fourth ball.

1087
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:27,034
You'll have 15 seconds
to do it

1088
00:52:27,068 --> 00:52:28,931
starting now.

1089
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,172
You can drop any time
in that window.

1090
00:52:33,206 --> 00:52:35,413
Romeo drops.

1091
00:52:37,793 --> 00:52:40,827
Jonathan drops.

1092
00:52:40,862 --> 00:52:42,448
Jonathan drops, and he's out.

1093
00:52:42,482 --> 00:52:44,310
Can't make the transition.

1094
00:52:44,344 --> 00:52:47,586
Romeo wins
his first individual immunity,

1095
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,620
and it could not have come at a bigger time.

1096
00:52:51,655 --> 00:52:54,586
Romeo is in charge
of everything tonight.

1097
00:52:57,344 --> 00:52:59,206
Congratulations.
- Wow. What a challenge.

1098
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:01,517
- On any given day...
- I'm proud of you. Great job.

1099
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:03,068
...anybody can win anything.

1100
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,551
You have the inspiration
in your heart.

1101
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:08,724
Romeo, what is it right now?

1102
00:53:08,758 --> 00:53:11,931
I want to know right now.

1103
00:53:11,965 --> 00:53:15,344
I feel like I've been at the
bottom of this game for so long,

1104
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:18,724
and I've just been hanging on
by my fingernails.

1105
00:53:18,758 --> 00:53:20,862
Every Tribal, my name comes up.

1106
00:53:20,896 --> 00:53:24,344
Every single Tribal,
Romeo was always the "in case."

1107
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:27,482
In case somebody pulls an idol,
throw some votes on Romeo.

1108
00:53:27,517 --> 00:53:28,931
It's just... it's exhausting.

1109
00:53:28,965 --> 00:53:31,551
I've been fighting so hard,
and this feels good.

1110
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:35,241
And I'm going to go back home,

1111
00:53:35,275 --> 00:53:37,344
and to all those young women
that I work with

1112
00:53:37,379 --> 00:53:39,103
and tell them, "That's what
I tried to teach you.

1113
00:53:39,137 --> 00:53:41,689
"Just-just don't give up
because, hey,

1114
00:53:41,724 --> 00:53:43,344
you could be in the final three
of <i>Survivor."</i>

1115
00:53:43,379 --> 00:53:45,827
This is a dream come true.

1116
00:53:46,827 --> 00:53:49,000
Let me come to you.

1117
00:53:49,034 --> 00:53:51,896
- Yeah!
- Great job.

1118
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:53,793
- Jeff.
- Final four immunity.

1119
00:53:53,827 --> 00:53:55,793
You are not only safe.

1120
00:53:55,827 --> 00:53:59,103
Every decision that happens
tonight will be yours.

1121
00:53:59,137 --> 00:54:02,068
All right, everybody, grab
your stuff, head back to camp.

1122
00:54:02,103 --> 00:54:04,068
I will see you tonight
for the biggest Tribal

1123
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:05,482
- of the season. Congrats.
- Thank you.

1124
00:54:05,517 --> 00:54:07,344
See you, Jeff.
Great job, man. Hey.

1125
00:54:07,379 --> 00:54:09,517
<i>It was</i> <i>
extremely emotional for me</i>

1126
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:12,689
because I felt like, after
winning this, for the first time

1127
00:54:12,724 --> 00:54:15,034
<i>in a long time, I had security.</i>

1128
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:18,034
<i>
This is definitely</i>

1129
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:20,655
my Miss America moment. The
spotlight's going to be on me.

1130
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:23,172
<i>I have the shiniest dress.</i>

1131
00:54:23,206 --> 00:54:26,206
I have the most expensive dress
and the most coveted dress, so

1132
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:28,275
<i>we'll see what I do tonight.</i>

1133
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:45,655
Good job, Romeo.
Good job, Romeo.

1134
00:54:45,689 --> 00:54:47,862
Way to come through
when it counted, brother.

1135
00:54:47,896 --> 00:54:48,896
Thank you, guys.

1136
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:51,655
<i>Coming back from the challenge,</i> <i>
I felt like</i>

1137
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:56,482
MVP, Miss Universe
and prom queen all combined.

1138
00:54:56,517 --> 00:55:01,034
<i>I beat Jonathan in the final</i> <i>
immunity challenge.</i>

1139
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:04,034
<i>I am just thrilled,</i>

1140
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:07,000
and I think this necklace looks
a lot better on me

1141
00:55:07,034 --> 00:55:08,965
than it does
on big-ass Jonathan.

1142
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:13,517
All good.

1143
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:18,206
<i>This big victory going into</i>

1144
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:21,068
<i>one of the most important</i> <i>
Tribal Councils--</i>

1145
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:25,103
it's just kind of like vengeance
for all those horrible Tribals

1146
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:28,793
where people just dismissed me

1147
00:55:28,827 --> 00:55:31,448
and-and just threw my name
out there just in case.

1148
00:55:31,482 --> 00:55:34,793
<i>So it feels amazing,</i> <i>
and I'm enjoying it.</i>

1149
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:37,724
Oh, Romeo, unless you have
your mind made up, and you want

1150
00:55:37,758 --> 00:55:39,793
- to say something, I'd like to talk to you first.
- Sure.

1151
00:55:39,827 --> 00:55:41,000
- Hey, I'll talk to everybody...
- Has nothing to do with...

1152
00:55:41,034 --> 00:55:42,000
It has nothing to do
with strategy.

1153
00:55:42,034 --> 00:55:43,586
It's about my personal feeling.

1154
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,448
<i>Romeo has to send me</i> <i>
to make fire because</i>

1155
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:51,482
<i>it's the consensus</i> <i>
that I'm the most dangerous.</i>

1156
00:55:51,517 --> 00:55:55,275
It's a compliment and a curse.
It is what it is.

1157
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,310
<i>I think I can beat Maryanne.</i>

1158
00:55:57,344 --> 00:55:59,379
<i>Jonathan could be</i> <i>
a different story, though.</i>

1159
00:55:59,413 --> 00:56:02,793
I'm in deep water,
but I didn't drown yet.

1160
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:04,689
I know you're gonna have
to ask me to make fire.

1161
00:56:04,724 --> 00:56:08,000
I want you to know
that there's no animosity.

1162
00:56:08,034 --> 00:56:10,206
If I'm being 100% honest,
I know I'm the right move.

1163
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,000
You'd be silly not to send me.

1164
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:13,758
- That's why I know it's going to happen.
- I respect that a lot.

1165
00:56:13,793 --> 00:56:15,965
You need to think
about the other two.

1166
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,862
- <i>-
- If I go against Jonathan...</i> <i> Yeah.</i>

1167
00:56:17,896 --> 00:56:20,206
<i>...and I beat Jonathan,</i> <i>
then you have to deal</i>

1168
00:56:20,241 --> 00:56:21,586
<i>with me and Maryanne.</i>

1169
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,379
- That's true.
- But if you make me make fire

1170
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,482
against Maryanne
instead of Jonathan,

1171
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:27,172
- you only got to deal with one of us.
- Yeah.

1172
00:56:27,206 --> 00:56:29,620
<i>I do have to send Mike</i> <i>
to make fire,</i>

1173
00:56:29,655 --> 00:56:31,724
<i>but he has a good point.</i>

1174
00:56:31,758 --> 00:56:35,310
<i>If he goes against Jonathan</i> <i>
and he beats Jonathan,</i>

1175
00:56:35,344 --> 00:56:36,862
now I'm going to be going

1176
00:56:36,896 --> 00:56:38,931
against the two most likable
people in the final three--

1177
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:40,620
Mike and Maryanne.

1178
00:56:40,655 --> 00:56:42,344
You need to make a bold move.
That's up to you.

1179
00:56:42,379 --> 00:56:44,172
- Listen, I'm giving you advice. I'm just telling you...
- Yeah.

1180
00:56:44,206 --> 00:56:45,551
- that's how I would think about it.
- Yeah.

1181
00:56:45,586 --> 00:56:47,517
<i>I'm weighing everything</i> <i>
at this point</i>

1182
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:50,241
<i>because what good would it do</i> <i>
for me</i>

1183
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:53,068
<i>to get to the top three</i> <i>
and end up</i>

1184
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:55,965
third place or second place?
I want to win.

1185
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,172
Jonathan, are you ready?

1186
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:59,275
- Yes.
- Go.

1187
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,275
Oh, that's a good amount.

1188
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,034
- Oh, nice. Whoa!
- Hold on.

1189
00:57:10,068 --> 00:57:13,206
<i>Jonathan is</i> <i>
very good at making fire,</i>

1190
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:17,344
<i>and my fire-making, I would say,</i> <i>
is decent, but the thing is,</i>

1191
00:57:17,379 --> 00:57:19,379
you never know what's going
to happen at Tribal.

1192
00:57:19,413 --> 00:57:20,517
Maybe I'm going to choke.

1193
00:57:20,551 --> 00:57:22,793
Maybe Mike is like,
"I'm a super good fire maker."

1194
00:57:22,827 --> 00:57:25,655
<i>So, the best thing</i> <i>
for me is for Romeo</i>

1195
00:57:25,689 --> 00:57:27,724
to put Jonathan and Mike
for fire,

1196
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:29,344
<i>and Jonathan wins.</i>

1197
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,758
You're good.
You just have to focus on, like,

1198
00:57:30,793 --> 00:57:32,310
building a fast teepee up,

1199
00:57:32,344 --> 00:57:34,103
'cause the trick is
to get the sticks to catch.

1200
00:57:34,137 --> 00:57:36,448
- They're caught. Mm-hmm.
- Once the sticks catch, you've won.

1201
00:57:36,482 --> 00:57:38,655
- So the sticks are caught. Do you see that?
- Then you're good.

1202
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:40,586
<i>I've been telling Jonathan</i> <i>
all the tips</i>

1203
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,310
<i>and tricks to go</i> <i>
and make fire because</i>

1204
00:57:42,344 --> 00:57:45,206
I don't want Mike here
in the final three with me.

1205
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:46,931
I want Jonathan and Romeo

1206
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:49,000
because that is my best shot
at winning.

1207
00:57:49,034 --> 00:57:51,758
- So, what was that? Like, 30 seconds?
- Yeah, that was, like,

1208
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:54,034
surprisingly fast.

1209
00:57:54,068 --> 00:57:55,620
Jon, do you want
to go talk, my brother?

1210
00:57:55,655 --> 00:57:57,034
- Yeah, I do.
- Look at you practicing, huh?

1211
00:57:57,068 --> 00:57:58,517
You don't need practice.

1212
00:57:58,551 --> 00:58:00,310
I need practice now.

1213
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:03,068
<i>The first thing you do to
prepare for a night like tonight</i>

1214
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:04,965
is you start a lot of fires.

1215
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,206
So I've been starting
a lot of fires.

1216
00:58:07,241 --> 00:58:08,551
And I've been
starting 'em quick,

1217
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:12,034
<i>but no one has seen Mike</i> <i>
make a fire.</i>

1218
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:13,517
I'm gonna try like hell to beat
your ass tonight in fire.

1219
00:58:13,551 --> 00:58:15,724
- You better, man. If you don't...
- Hey...

1220
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:17,275
- If you don't, I would be ashamed.
- I get one last...

1221
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:19,000
I got...
I got one last little bit in me.

1222
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:21,965
- I hope... I hope you try.
- Oh, I'm definitely gonna try.

1223
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,275
I ain't giving it to you.

1224
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,724
If you want it,
you got to take it off me.

1225
00:58:24,758 --> 00:58:26,724
Be honest. You start fires
a lot, don't you?

1226
00:58:26,758 --> 00:58:28,965
- I don't know.
- Ah, yes, you do.

1227
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,931
- Ah.
- I think that you've been dealing with fire too long

1228
00:58:31,965 --> 00:58:34,931
for you not
to be a good fire-starter.

1229
00:58:37,586 --> 00:58:39,137
I'll tell you what, though.

1230
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:41,724
If Romeo gives you an out
not to make fire,

1231
00:58:41,758 --> 00:58:43,827
take it.

1232
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:46,586
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1233
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,620
Don't lose your spot.
I'm telling you.

1234
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:50,965
- Yeah.
- Listen, you'll be the favorite,

1235
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,275
definitely, to beat me,

1236
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:54,482
but don't risk your spot
for that, man.

1237
00:58:54,517 --> 00:58:55,862
- I'm telling you right now.
- Yeah.

1238
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:57,172
<i>I know Mike's plan,</i>

1239
00:58:57,206 --> 00:58:58,517
and I know what he's doing.

1240
00:58:58,551 --> 00:58:59,655
He's trying to get in my head.

1241
00:58:59,689 --> 00:59:01,551
I'm being serious.

1242
00:59:01,586 --> 00:59:03,758
If he gives you the out,
take it.

1243
00:59:03,793 --> 00:59:06,896
Mike, that's not going to work
for me, buddy.</i>

1244
00:59:06,931 --> 00:59:09,137
I love you,
but you can't get in my head.

1245
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:11,379
You're just going
to get me hyped to beat you.

1246
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,724
This is exactly what I wanted.

1247
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,793
We need him, like, spooked.

1248
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:25,448
He's practicing right now.

1249
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:28,034
He doesn't know if he's going
against his buddy or you,

1250
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,827
and I want to keep it that way. Okay.

1251
00:59:45,103 --> 00:59:47,758
<i>
I can't sit down and relax</i> <i>
and be comfortable.</i>

1252
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,896
I have to be prepared to make
fire, because, in the end,

1253
00:59:49,931 --> 00:59:52,172
<i>Romeo has all the power.</i>

1254
00:59:52,206 --> 00:59:53,586
<i>He might blindside me,</i>

1255
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,655
<i>and I might have</i> <i>
to make fire against Mike.</i>

1256
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:56,931
'Cause the trick is,

1257
00:59:56,965 --> 00:59:59,482
you just want to get
the tiny sticks to ignite

1258
00:59:59,517 --> 01:00:01,482
'cause once you have
those tiny sticks ignited...

1259
01:00:01,517 --> 01:00:02,931
- Yeah.
- ...it's game over.

1260
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:06,620
<i>
For 21 years,</i> <i>
I've been watching</i> Survivor.

1261
01:00:08,344 --> 01:00:10,413
<i>I always had one dream</i> <i>
in my life.</i>

1262
01:00:10,448 --> 01:00:12,000
The last thing that I would
want to put on the top

1263
01:00:12,034 --> 01:00:15,241
of my résumé of life-- and
I have a pretty good résumé--

1264
01:00:15,275 --> 01:00:16,379
<i>it would be to win</i> Survivor.

1265
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,448
<i>So tonight,</i> <i>
whether I have to make fire</i>

1266
01:00:28,482 --> 01:00:31,517
<i>against Maryanne or Jonathan,</i> <i>
there's only one choice--</i>

1267
01:00:31,551 --> 01:00:33,482
<i>for me to win.</i>

1268
01:00:33,517 --> 01:00:35,793
My fate is in my own hands,

1269
01:00:35,827 --> 01:00:39,724
<i>and I truly feel that if I win</i> <i>
at making fire tonight,</i>

1270
01:00:39,758 --> 01:00:42,724
<i>I will win a million dollars.</i> <i>
So,</i>

1271
01:00:42,758 --> 01:00:44,413
this is for me to lose.

1272
01:01:13,206 --> 01:01:17,827
All right, let's talk
about the past couple of days.

1273
01:01:17,862 --> 01:01:19,827
If you start yesterday morning,
you had a riddle.

1274
01:01:19,862 --> 01:01:21,965
Lindsay solves it.
She gets an advantage

1275
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,241
in the immunity challenge.
Turns out, the time advantage

1276
01:01:25,275 --> 01:01:27,758
was enough, in theory,
to have won.

1277
01:01:27,793 --> 01:01:30,896
But Mike ends up winning,
the guy that some would say,

1278
01:01:30,931 --> 01:01:33,413
least likely to win
on a complicated puzzle.

1279
01:01:33,448 --> 01:01:35,448
- You said it many times.
- Absolutely.

1280
01:01:35,482 --> 01:01:37,034
We get to Tribal Council.

1281
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,724
Lindsay can't persuade you
to keep her

1282
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:41,448
because she's too big a threat.
She's now on the jury.

1283
01:01:41,482 --> 01:01:45,034
We get to today. Romeo,
a lot of people would have said,

1284
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,482
if you're gonna look
at past history,

1285
01:01:46,517 --> 01:01:48,068
you're the long shot to win.

1286
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:50,344
And then you win.
And what it reminded me

1287
01:01:50,379 --> 01:01:54,551
is that so much of what
we accomplish in life starts

1288
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:56,206
with showing up,

1289
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:59,068
and by showing up,
you're still in the game,

1290
01:01:59,103 --> 01:02:01,793
and you have
all the power tonight.

1291
01:02:01,827 --> 01:02:05,793
So, as you sit here,
what is that feeling of knowing,

1292
01:02:05,827 --> 01:02:08,482
"I hung in there long enough,
and when I needed to,

1293
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:10,206
I did what I had to do"?

1294
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:13,172
I mean, I work with all types
of people back home,

1295
01:02:13,206 --> 01:02:16,448
and I encourage them to be
the very best that they can be.

1296
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:20,689
And somehow, in this game,
for the first time,

1297
01:02:20,724 --> 01:02:24,517
I had to use that advice
that I give them on myself.

1298
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:28,413
No matter how low I'm feeling,
I still had to keep pushing.

1299
01:02:28,448 --> 01:02:33,206
It's just a reminder that
if you just hang on long enough,

1300
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:35,068
it can happen.

1301
01:02:35,103 --> 01:02:37,068
And that's why
I was so emotional today

1302
01:02:37,103 --> 01:02:39,655
because I did it,
and I'm very proud of myself.

1303
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:43,241
All right, before we get
to your decision,

1304
01:02:43,275 --> 01:02:45,068
let me check in
with everybody else. Maryanne,

1305
01:02:45,103 --> 01:02:47,862
- how you feeling?
- You know, you always feel like

1306
01:02:47,896 --> 01:02:49,413
you're going to vomit
'cause it's like,

1307
01:02:49,448 --> 01:02:52,586
I've watched the show and,
like, I've seen people be like,

1308
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,137
yeah, they do fire at camp,
and they get here,

1309
01:02:54,172 --> 01:02:56,413
and they can't do... They can't
even catch a flame, right?

1310
01:02:56,448 --> 01:02:59,586
So, like, even, like, how
confident I feel, it's like

1311
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:02,379
anything can happen
at Tribal, so...

1312
01:03:02,413 --> 01:03:03,793
Did you practice making fire?

1313
01:03:03,827 --> 01:03:05,275
Yes, I did.

1314
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:08,103
Jonathan, how are you feeling
about your fire-making skills?

1315
01:03:08,137 --> 01:03:10,517
I'm pretty good at making fires,
Mr. Jeff.

1316
01:03:11,724 --> 01:03:13,482
Mike, what was your take
on the afternoon?

1317
01:03:13,517 --> 01:03:15,896
Well, the worst
kept secret at camp was

1318
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:18,862
I'm definitely making fire tonight.

1319
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:21,448
I mean, it's
obviously ironic a bit

1320
01:03:21,482 --> 01:03:22,931
that the fireman
would be making fire,

1321
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,551
but it doesn't mean
you know how to make them

1322
01:03:25,586 --> 01:03:27,551
just because you have
a living of putting them out.

1323
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:28,793
Very true.

1324
01:03:28,827 --> 01:03:31,586
I watched Jonathan make fire
for the last 12 to 13 days.

1325
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,758
He's very good at it.

1326
01:03:32,793 --> 01:03:34,724
I will give it my best shot.

1327
01:03:34,758 --> 01:03:37,827
So you feel like it's you and
Jonathan. That's what I heard.

1328
01:03:37,862 --> 01:03:39,620
And that's exactly
what I'm saying.

1329
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:41,758
I feel like it's me and Jonathan.

1330
01:03:41,793 --> 01:03:43,896
They're putting their best
fire maker against me.

1331
01:03:43,931 --> 01:03:45,862
So you're the target?

1332
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:48,827
Absolutely.

1333
01:03:48,862 --> 01:03:50,137
All right,
well, let's find out.

1334
01:03:50,172 --> 01:03:52,379
So, Romeo, before you tell me,
just walk me through

1335
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:55,413
the different things
you considered and why.

1336
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:57,827
Yeah, I mean, I felt
like Miss Universe,

1337
01:03:57,862 --> 01:04:00,172
and this was my crown, and
everybody wanted to talk to me.

1338
01:04:00,206 --> 01:04:01,724
It felt great, uh,

1339
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:05,034
but it's not as easy
as-as they think it is.

1340
01:04:05,068 --> 01:04:06,793
It was like
a tennis match in my head.

1341
01:04:06,827 --> 01:04:09,034
Am I making the right choice?
I don't know.

1342
01:04:09,068 --> 01:04:11,896
I might be making a million-
dollar mistake, or not.

1343
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:15,172
I-I don't know, but I've played
my game since day one

1344
01:04:15,206 --> 01:04:18,379
based on my gut feeling,
and I'm still here.

1345
01:04:18,413 --> 01:04:19,931
So obviously
I did something right.

1346
01:04:19,965 --> 01:04:22,103
And, uh, I'm going
with my gut tonight.

1347
01:04:22,137 --> 01:04:24,448
Okay. So, congratulations.

1348
01:04:24,482 --> 01:04:26,896
First spot at the final three
is yours.

1349
01:04:26,931 --> 01:04:28,931
You will get a chance to
plead your case tomorrow night

1350
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:29,965
to this jury.

1351
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,620
The next decision is

1352
01:04:31,655 --> 01:04:33,413
who's going to be sitting
next to you

1353
01:04:33,448 --> 01:04:36,206
in that second spot
at the final three.

1354
01:04:38,517 --> 01:04:40,586
Who's that gonna be?

1355
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,793
Ah.

1356
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,448
I'm taking Maryanne with me.

1357
01:04:49,206 --> 01:04:50,655
And these two are making fire.

1358
01:04:51,689 --> 01:04:54,034
All right, so, Maryanne,
you are now in the final three.

1359
01:04:54,068 --> 01:04:56,965
You, too, will get a chance to plead your case

1360
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,689
to the jury tomorrow night.

1361
01:04:58,724 --> 01:05:01,344
The only question left
is to see who is going to be

1362
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:03,793
- the third person next to you.
- I love you, brother.

1363
01:05:03,827 --> 01:05:04,931
I love you, too, man.

1364
01:05:04,965 --> 01:05:05,931
You guys can take your spots.

1365
01:05:05,965 --> 01:05:07,551
Good luck, guys.

1366
01:05:10,758 --> 01:05:13,137
Give you a minute
to look at everything,

1367
01:05:13,172 --> 01:05:14,551
and then we'll begin.

1368
01:05:27,517 --> 01:05:29,689
All right, so,
what you're looking to do

1369
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:32,103
is make a flame high enough
and hot enough

1370
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:33,793
to burn through
and raise that flag.

1371
01:05:33,827 --> 01:05:35,241
First to do it will be sitting

1372
01:05:35,275 --> 01:05:36,931
at the final Tribal Council tomorrow.

1373
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:38,793
The other person will
be sitting on the jury.

1374
01:05:39,827 --> 01:05:41,103
Stakes don't get bigger. No.

1375
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,034
- Are you both ready?
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1376
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:44,551
Let's begin.

1377
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:48,965
Been doing this since season 35.

1378
01:05:49,965 --> 01:05:53,827
Both guys get some coconut husk
and start shaving magnesium.

1379
01:05:54,896 --> 01:05:57,344
That magnesium is what's
gonna give you that igniter.

1380
01:06:02,137 --> 01:06:05,000
Jonathan,
now trying to get a spark going.

1381
01:06:08,379 --> 01:06:10,068
It's one thing to do it at camp,

1382
01:06:10,103 --> 01:06:12,310
it's another to do it on
the stage at Tribal Council

1383
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:15,034
with the million dollars
potentially on the line.

1384
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,275
No flame yet.

1385
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:21,862
That's pretty normal, too.

1386
01:06:27,689 --> 01:06:29,655
Jonathan going back
for sparks again.

1387
01:06:29,689 --> 01:06:31,620
Had a little something.
Can he get it? No.

1388
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,103
Jonathan once again
trying to nurture

1389
01:06:42,137 --> 01:06:43,206
a little spark into a flame.

1390
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:44,896
Can't do it.

1391
01:06:44,931 --> 01:06:46,482
Mike still working.

1392
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,310
Mike's got flame first.

1393
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:56,724
You only have a limited amount
of coconut husk,

1394
01:06:56,758 --> 01:06:58,034
so you don't want
to use all of it.

1395
01:06:58,068 --> 01:06:59,931
It burns quickly,

1396
01:06:59,965 --> 01:07:03,620
but it also burns out
just as fast.

1397
01:07:04,655 --> 01:07:07,896
So once you get a flame,
it's what you do with it.

1398
01:07:09,517 --> 01:07:11,034
Mike going for it.

1399
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,000
He's putting a lot
of coconut husk up there.

1400
01:07:14,517 --> 01:07:15,965
Just dumping sticks on.

1401
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,275
Got to keep it going.

1402
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:18,965
Jonathan now has
a little something.

1403
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,827
He's working it.
Can he get it to take hold?

1404
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,172
Jonathan's got flame now.

1405
01:07:28,172 --> 01:07:29,172
He's in it.

1406
01:07:29,206 --> 01:07:31,068
He's gonna add
more coconut husk.

1407
01:07:31,103 --> 01:07:33,000
Takes a lot
to burn through that rope.

1408
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:35,655
The occasional glance
off of the fibers

1409
01:07:35,689 --> 01:07:37,172
of that rope won't be enough.

1410
01:07:37,206 --> 01:07:40,172
You got to get a flame that's
gonna be on there for a moment.

1411
01:07:40,206 --> 01:07:42,310
Mike's is now
starting to hit the rope

1412
01:07:42,344 --> 01:07:44,344
a little more consistently.

1413
01:07:44,379 --> 01:07:46,310
It's shooting pretty high.

1414
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:49,551
Jonathan has his going.

1415
01:07:49,586 --> 01:07:51,517
Now he's trying
to build something.

1416
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:52,620
Side by side.

1417
01:07:52,655 --> 01:07:54,862
25 days into <i>Survivor 42.</i>

1418
01:07:54,896 --> 01:07:56,724
A million dollars on the line.

1419
01:07:56,758 --> 01:07:59,068
Mike's flame burning high again.

1420
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:02,034
You can see that rope burning
little by little.

1421
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:06,793
Jonathan doing a nice job
to get his fire going.

1422
01:08:06,827 --> 01:08:09,379
We've got two good fires
going right now.

1423
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:15,275
Mike adding more sticks.

1424
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:17,241
No real pattern with Mike.

1425
01:08:17,275 --> 01:08:20,000
He's just putting timber
on the flame.

1426
01:08:21,896 --> 01:08:23,896
Jonathan a little more organized,

1427
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:26,275
trying to build something,
more of a structure.

1428
01:08:27,413 --> 01:08:30,965
Mike is more of a backyard, and
he's burning through that rope.

1429
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:35,827
Now the wind is
blowing Mike's flame sideways,

1430
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,827
almost into Jonathan.

1431
01:08:37,862 --> 01:08:39,620
You're both still in this,

1432
01:08:39,655 --> 01:08:41,965
but Mike has
a big fire going right now.

1433
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,482
Jonathan has a small fire.

1434
01:08:46,448 --> 01:08:50,068
And Mike's flame
is really starting to burn.

1435
01:08:50,103 --> 01:08:52,517
It is right where you want it.
It is killing it.

1436
01:09:01,482 --> 01:09:04,413
- Yeah! Yes!
- There it is. It's over.

1437
01:09:04,448 --> 01:09:08,413
Yes!
Mike will have the final seat

1438
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:11,034
at the final Tribal Council
of <i>Survivor 42.</i>

1439
01:09:11,068 --> 01:09:13,103
Oh, my God.
Great matchup.

1440
01:09:13,137 --> 01:09:14,965
Both guys got fire. Boom.

1441
01:09:16,206 --> 01:09:18,034
The fireman pulled it out.

1442
01:09:18,068 --> 01:09:19,034
Mm.

1443
01:09:20,275 --> 01:09:22,413
Jonathan, before you pack up,
have a seat.

1444
01:09:22,448 --> 01:09:24,413
Yeah.

1445
01:09:24,448 --> 01:09:25,724
So what are you thinking,

1446
01:09:25,758 --> 01:09:27,517
Jonathan, when you're
looking at your fire?

1447
01:09:27,551 --> 01:09:28,862
Which is still going.

1448
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:31,551
That's a decent fire
in the fire-making challenge.

1449
01:09:31,586 --> 01:09:33,655
Mike just built an inferno.

1450
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:34,724
Yeah.

1451
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:37,551
Yeah.

1452
01:09:37,586 --> 01:09:39,965
You know what, Jeff?
I was thinking when I got here,

1453
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,793
if-if I lose,
then I was meant to lose.

1454
01:09:41,827 --> 01:09:43,482
I-I gave it what I had.

1455
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:46,034
Mike's just-- he beat me.

1456
01:09:47,034 --> 01:09:49,000
Yeah, it's that simple.

1457
01:09:49,034 --> 01:09:51,206
Mike, what are you feeling,

1458
01:09:51,241 --> 01:09:53,620
because you're the guy
that just took Jonathan out

1459
01:09:53,655 --> 01:09:55,862
and earned your spot
in the final three?

1460
01:09:55,896 --> 01:09:59,034
You know, it's--
obviously I'm... I-I'm...

1461
01:09:59,068 --> 01:10:01,034
ecstatic over
what just happened.

1462
01:10:01,068 --> 01:10:02,931
Um, I'm happy that
I went against Jonathan,

1463
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:04,827
because Jonathan
has been known as

1464
01:10:04,862 --> 01:10:06,344
the best fire-starter
in the camp.

1465
01:10:06,379 --> 01:10:08,310
He's been very, very good at it.

1466
01:10:08,344 --> 01:10:12,241
It made it that much more,
um, rewarding for me,

1467
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:14,000
that I went against somebody
that was...

1468
01:10:14,034 --> 01:10:15,517
not a pushover.

1469
01:10:16,482 --> 01:10:19,655
Jonathan,
you lasted 25 of 26 days.

1470
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:22,000
You got almost
as far as you can go.

1471
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:23,551
It's time to grab your torch.

1472
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:32,482
I love you, brother.
I love you, guys.

1473
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:37,275
And, Mr. Jeff, I got to say.

1474
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,275
Say it.

1475
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:40,068
I fought the good fight.

1476
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:41,758
And, Jonathan...

1477
01:10:41,793 --> 01:10:44,655
The tribe has spoken.

1478
01:10:46,482 --> 01:10:47,517
Time for you to go.

1479
01:10:49,655 --> 01:10:51,689
Hey, my friends.

1480
01:10:53,068 --> 01:10:54,586
All love.
The same.

1481
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,068
Bye, Jon.

1482
01:11:00,655 --> 01:11:04,241
All right,
Mike, Romeo, Maryanne.

1483
01:11:05,034 --> 01:11:06,862
Regardless how you got here,

1484
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:10,793
you did what 15 other players
in this game could not do.

1485
01:11:10,827 --> 01:11:13,758
You made it to the final three.
Your work is not done.

1486
01:11:13,793 --> 01:11:17,000
Your last job is to
claim your victory,

1487
01:11:17,034 --> 01:11:18,758
and that happens
tomorrow night

1488
01:11:18,793 --> 01:11:21,655
when the power shifts

1489
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:24,793
to this jury, plus Jonathan,
who will be there tomorrow.

1490
01:11:24,827 --> 01:11:27,482
Tomorrow night they're
gonna put you through a Q and A.

1491
01:11:27,517 --> 01:11:29,896
Their job is to hold you
accountable for your actions

1492
01:11:29,931 --> 01:11:32,206
and make you prove
why you deserve

1493
01:11:32,241 --> 01:11:34,482
the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars,

1494
01:11:34,517 --> 01:11:36,482
rather than the other two.

1495
01:11:36,517 --> 01:11:38,862
This is your last night in Fiji.

1496
01:11:38,896 --> 01:11:41,206
I hope you enjoy it.
I hope you get some sleep.

1497
01:11:41,241 --> 01:11:43,793
I'll see you tomorrow night
for your final Tribal Council.

1498
01:11:43,827 --> 01:11:46,000
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much. Thank you...
- Thanks, Jeff.

1499
01:11:46,965 --> 01:11:49,448
Oh.

1500
01:11:49,482 --> 01:11:52,344
I got to tell you,
I was so shocked

1501
01:11:52,379 --> 01:11:54,241
to see how fast

1502
01:11:54,275 --> 01:11:57,689
my main man Mike
started that fire.

1503
01:11:57,724 --> 01:11:59,758
<i>He beat me fair and square.</i>

1504
01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:03,103
<i>He earned his spot</i> <i>
in the top three.</i>

1505
01:12:03,137 --> 01:12:06,793
<i>And if I get the chance,</i> <i>
you better believe</i>

1506
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:09,482
<i>that I'm gonna be</i> <i>
right back out here.</i>

1507
01:12:09,517 --> 01:12:12,241
Thank you, God.
Thank you, <i>Survivor.</i>

1508
01:12:12,275 --> 01:12:14,620
Thank you for the opportunity.

1509
01:12:29,034 --> 01:12:30,586
Look at the sun.

1510
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:32,379
See it right there,
starting to peek through?

1511
01:12:32,413 --> 01:12:34,793
Oh, my God. I love the sun.
Oh, my goodness. That's beautiful.

1512
01:12:34,827 --> 01:12:38,655
It's gonna get warm. It's the 26th day.
Oh, my God.

1513
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:40,275
There it is.

1514
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:41,586
Know what's even more beautiful?

1515
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,275
Look how different
all three of us are.

1516
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:44,482
- And we're still here.
- I know.

1517
01:12:45,517 --> 01:12:48,241
So, it's the morning
of the 26th,

1518
01:12:48,275 --> 01:12:49,758
the last day
you're on <i>Survivor.</i>

1519
01:12:49,793 --> 01:12:53,344
<i>But, of course, I feel</i> <i>
like this game ain't over.</i>

1520
01:12:53,379 --> 01:12:55,241
<i>This game's not over at all.</i>

1521
01:12:55,275 --> 01:12:57,068
<i>And immediately</i> <i>
what goes through my head is:</i>

1522
01:12:57,103 --> 01:12:58,655
what am I gonna say
to the jury?

1523
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:03,241
How am I gonna talk to the jury?

1524
01:13:03,275 --> 01:13:06,586
<i>Eight jury members are gonna</i> <i>
ask hard-hitting questions.</i>

1525
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,000
I think I'm sitting
in a good spot,

1526
01:13:09,034 --> 01:13:10,172
but does that mean
I'm in a good spot?

1527
01:13:10,206 --> 01:13:11,827
If Mike comes out tonight
and says,

1528
01:13:11,862 --> 01:13:15,310
"My strategy was
to play a man of integrity

1529
01:13:15,344 --> 01:13:17,620
and to stab you in the back,"
fantastic.

1530
01:13:17,655 --> 01:13:20,172
<i>
Mike played a very good game.</i>

1531
01:13:20,206 --> 01:13:22,551
He was able to disarm
and manipulate a lot of people,

1532
01:13:22,586 --> 01:13:26,034
<i>
Mike, using his social game,</i>

1533
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,310
hit the hearts

1534
01:13:27,344 --> 01:13:28,862
<i>of a lot of players.</i>

1535
01:13:28,896 --> 01:13:30,931
<i>
I need Mike to own</i>

1536
01:13:30,965 --> 01:13:32,758
that he was a snake.

1537
01:13:32,793 --> 01:13:35,551
<i>If that was intentional,</i> <i>
he could get my vote</i>

1538
01:13:35,586 --> 01:13:37,034
for a million dollars.

1539
01:13:38,862 --> 01:13:41,068
Oh, my God!
Yes! Yes!

1540
01:13:41,103 --> 01:13:42,275
Oh!

1541
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:44,965
There's, look, look.
I told you, Danishes.

1542
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,103
Oh, my goodness,
Look at... Give me some, brother.

1543
01:13:47,137 --> 01:13:49,379
Oh, my God!
Yeah.

1544
01:13:49,413 --> 01:13:51,206
If you're voting for the person</i>

1545
01:13:51,241 --> 01:13:52,551
<i>that played the best game,</i>

1546
01:13:52,586 --> 01:13:53,551
give it to me.

1547
01:13:53,586 --> 01:13:55,034
I'm the ultimate underdog.

1548
01:13:55,068 --> 01:13:57,793
Cheers for the most unlikely
final three.

1549
01:13:57,827 --> 01:14:01,034
And one of us winning a million dollars.

1550
01:14:01,068 --> 01:14:04,689
<i>
Now we're going</i> <i>
into the final pageant,</i>

1551
01:14:04,724 --> 01:14:07,551
and I want that crown
and that Miss <i>Survivor</i> sash.

1552
01:14:07,586 --> 01:14:08,758
That's what I want.

1553
01:14:08,793 --> 01:14:11,689
Romeo's strength
was the fact that he was weak.

1554
01:14:11,724 --> 01:14:14,689
<i>He played the game</i> <i>
on a weaker level,</i>

1555
01:14:14,724 --> 01:14:16,137
<i>so he could be forgotten.</i>

1556
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:18,034
And if that was his strategy
and that's the way he played,

1557
01:14:18,068 --> 01:14:19,241
that's brilliant, dude.

1558
01:14:20,275 --> 01:14:21,896
<i>
Romeo's game might deserve</i>

1559
01:14:21,931 --> 01:14:23,896
<i>a little bit more</i> <i>
credit and respect,</i>

1560
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:26,827
<i>because basically he said,</i> <i>
"Think of me as a goat."</i>

1561
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,034
Take me to the end,

1562
01:14:28,068 --> 01:14:29,862
and I'm gonna tell you
exactly why I'm not.

1563
01:14:30,896 --> 01:14:33,310
<i>
A lot of us want to reward</i> <i>
the most aggressive player,</i>

1564
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:37,034
<i>but why is it</i> <i>
more impressive to be</i>

1565
01:14:37,068 --> 01:14:38,758
an elephant than a cockroach,

1566
01:14:38,793 --> 01:14:40,620
who's gonna survive
the apocalypse?

1567
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,068
I'm truly so full right now.

1568
01:14:44,068 --> 01:14:45,068
No. Come on.

1569
01:14:46,517 --> 01:14:47,586
I know.

1570
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,551
<i>To be successful tonight,</i>

1571
01:14:49,586 --> 01:14:52,482
I need to go and be honest
about my game.

1572
01:14:52,517 --> 01:14:53,724
<i>At this point,</i>

1573
01:14:53,758 --> 01:14:55,586
<i>the roller coaster</i> <i>
has already moved.</i>

1574
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,344
<i>There's no getting out,</i>

1575
01:14:57,379 --> 01:14:59,172
<i>which means,</i> <i>
when I go down, I have to</i>

1576
01:14:59,206 --> 01:15:00,551
raise my hands and scream
and be like,

1577
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:02,965
"This is what I did
in these past 26 days."

1578
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,206
<i>I want to show</i> <i>
that I can still be myself</i>

1579
01:15:06,241 --> 01:15:07,586
<i>and I can still be weird,</i>

1580
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:09,448
but in the end I can succeed.

1581
01:15:09,482 --> 01:15:12,448
People think she was just used
as a vote, as a pawn,

1582
01:15:12,482 --> 01:15:16,000
<i>which is why I need Maryanne</i> <i>
to articulate what she did</i>

1583
01:15:16,034 --> 01:15:17,896
to drive the season.

1584
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:20,206
I am so happy for Maryanne.

1585
01:15:20,241 --> 01:15:23,793
<i>She made herself seem</i> <i>
like this silly, younger girl</i>

1586
01:15:23,827 --> 01:15:25,275
<i>who can't be taken seriously,</i>

1587
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:26,689
but I know there's
a lot more to Maryanne

1588
01:15:26,724 --> 01:15:28,137
than other people are seeing.

1589
01:15:28,172 --> 01:15:29,827
<i>
I was with Maryanne</i> <i>
from day one,</i>

1590
01:15:29,862 --> 01:15:32,344
<i>and yet I have all this unknown.</i>

1591
01:15:32,379 --> 01:15:34,310
<i>You had all this potential</i> <i>
and all this knowledge.</i>

1592
01:15:34,344 --> 01:15:35,655
What did you do with it?

1593
01:15:35,689 --> 01:15:39,344
I hope Maryanne sways me.

1594
01:15:39,379 --> 01:15:40,551
<i>I am a feminist.</i>

1595
01:15:40,586 --> 01:15:42,862
<i>I want to give a woman</i> <i>
some money,</i>

1596
01:15:42,896 --> 01:15:44,344
<i>but I'm also a competitor</i>

1597
01:15:44,379 --> 01:15:46,379
<i>and I can't, in good faith,</i>

1598
01:15:46,413 --> 01:15:48,896
just give someone money
because I like them.

1599
01:15:48,931 --> 01:15:52,241
I did everything
except for win a challenge,

1600
01:15:52,275 --> 01:15:53,793
I believe, on my bucket list.

1601
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:57,482
And we should be proud,

1602
01:15:57,517 --> 01:15:58,310
'cause we're the last ones
of our tribe.

1603
01:15:58,344 --> 01:15:59,241
Yup.

1604
01:15:59,275 --> 01:16:02,344
One Taku, one Vati, one Ika.

1605
01:16:02,379 --> 01:16:02,931
Yup.

1606
01:16:02,965 --> 01:16:04,034
<i>Don't ever give up.</i>

1607
01:16:04,068 --> 01:16:05,448
<i>You fight and fight and fight.</i>

1608
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:06,689
This is the final fight.

1609
01:16:06,724 --> 01:16:08,241
You don't, you don't quit
in the fourth quarter.

1610
01:16:08,275 --> 01:16:12,275
I know I can close the deal and
be the winner of <i>Survivor 42.</i>

1611
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:14,482
<i>
They're about to be</i> <i>
surprised tonight.</i>

1612
01:16:14,517 --> 01:16:18,517
Deep inside this little man,
there's a, uh, a monster.

1613
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:20,310
We did it, guys. Final three.
We did.

1614
01:16:20,344 --> 01:16:21,620
Good luck tonight, all right? <i>
My vote</i>

1615
01:16:21,655 --> 01:16:23,551
is up for grabs.

1616
01:16:23,586 --> 01:16:26,689
<i>
I'm hoping</i> <i>
somebody comes with some beef</i>

1617
01:16:26,724 --> 01:16:28,034
that deserves
that million dollars.

1618
01:16:28,068 --> 01:16:29,758
<i>
I can only expect</i>

1619
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:31,758
<i>that the ending of season 42</i>

1620
01:16:31,793 --> 01:16:34,896
will be the most
unpredictable ever.

1621
01:16:38,034 --> 01:16:41,655
<i>
I am making the decision</i> <i>
to change someone's life.</i>

1622
01:16:41,689 --> 01:16:45,103
<i>
What was your move?</i> <i>
How did you drive the game?</i>

1623
01:16:45,137 --> 01:16:46,034
Convince me

1624
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:48,413
<i>why you deserve my vote.</i>

1625
01:16:48,448 --> 01:16:50,379
Give me straight-up honesty,

1626
01:16:50,413 --> 01:16:52,241
<i>'cause that's</i> <i>
what we're gonna respect.</i>

1627
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:54,862
And I want them to fight.

1628
01:16:54,896 --> 01:16:56,206
Fight.

1629
01:16:58,068 --> 01:17:00,275
Wow. Here we are.

1630
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:02,482
Final Tribal Council.

1631
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,758
Romeo, Maryanne, Mike.

1632
01:17:04,793 --> 01:17:07,413
There are stages to <i>Survivor.</i>

1633
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:10,758
You have the beginning, where
you need to form a strong tribe.

1634
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:13,586
Then you have
the individual game.

1635
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,068
And then, when
you get down to about five,

1636
01:17:15,103 --> 01:17:16,482
you have that final push,

1637
01:17:16,517 --> 01:17:19,241
and tonight is the last phase:
claim your victory.

1638
01:17:19,275 --> 01:17:20,241
This is it.

1639
01:17:20,275 --> 01:17:22,241
You have to convince

1640
01:17:22,275 --> 01:17:24,137
this group of people
that you voted out--

1641
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,482
you're the reason
they're over there--

1642
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,310
you deserve
the title of Sole Survivor

1643
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:30,000
and the million dollars
that goes with it.

1644
01:17:30,034 --> 01:17:32,896
If you sit back
and you're passive,

1645
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:34,551
you will not win this game.

1646
01:17:34,586 --> 01:17:36,586
Juries have shown this repeatedly.

1647
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:38,517
You got to stand up and take it.

1648
01:17:38,551 --> 01:17:39,827
Demand it.

1649
01:17:39,862 --> 01:17:42,827
Jury, your job is
to hold them accountable.

1650
01:17:42,862 --> 01:17:44,655
Tribal Council has always been

1651
01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:47,655
where you are held accountable
for your actions.

1652
01:17:47,689 --> 01:17:49,793
You're gonna put them
through an interrogation

1653
01:17:49,827 --> 01:17:52,482
that I feel confident
will be tough and respectful.

1654
01:17:52,517 --> 01:17:54,275
Both can exist.

1655
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:56,103
All right, I'm gonna give

1656
01:17:56,137 --> 01:17:57,379
everybody here a moment.

1657
01:17:59,379 --> 01:18:03,000
One big, deep breath,
and then we'll begin.

1658
01:18:14,965 --> 01:18:16,931
All right, it's time
for our final

1659
01:18:16,965 --> 01:18:19,689
Tribal Council Q and A
from the jury.

1660
01:18:19,724 --> 01:18:21,344
We're gonna examine the game tonight

1661
01:18:21,379 --> 01:18:25,344
from three different areas:
social, physical, strategic.

1662
01:18:25,379 --> 01:18:28,655
And I realize that they often
overlap, and that's okay.

1663
01:18:28,689 --> 01:18:31,103
All right. Who wants
to get us started? Omar.

1664
01:18:31,137 --> 01:18:32,551
All right.

1665
01:18:32,586 --> 01:18:35,068
It's been so long since
we've been able to talk to you,

1666
01:18:35,103 --> 01:18:37,103
so I wanted to congratulate
all three of you.

1667
01:18:37,137 --> 01:18:40,931
And this season
has been so unpredictable.

1668
01:18:40,965 --> 01:18:42,758
And it's so fitting
that you three,

1669
01:18:42,793 --> 01:18:46,172
who may be perceived
as three unexpected players,

1670
01:18:46,206 --> 01:18:48,551
are the ones that made it here.

1671
01:18:48,586 --> 01:18:51,206
And similar to Darwin's theory
of natural selection

1672
01:18:51,241 --> 01:18:52,793
and survival of the fittest,

1673
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:54,482
it's not always
the mighty elephant

1674
01:18:54,517 --> 01:18:57,310
or the powerful lion
that's gonna win.

1675
01:18:57,344 --> 01:19:00,793
Sometimes it's the honeybee,
which causes prosperity

1676
01:19:00,827 --> 01:19:02,655
in agriculture
across the world,

1677
01:19:02,689 --> 01:19:05,241
or even the cockroach,

1678
01:19:05,275 --> 01:19:07,827
who survives this apocalyptic game...

1679
01:19:07,862 --> 01:19:10,241
that we've had in season 42.

1680
01:19:10,275 --> 01:19:11,896
So, for tonight,

1681
01:19:11,931 --> 01:19:13,586
what we really want you
to do is present

1682
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,827
your survival of the fittest strategy

1683
01:19:15,862 --> 01:19:18,310
and make us sure that
you deserve to win,

1684
01:19:18,344 --> 01:19:21,793
because all our votes
are open tonight for any of you.

1685
01:19:21,827 --> 01:19:24,655
- So fight for your life tonight.
- That's right.

1686
01:19:25,655 --> 01:19:27,620
All right,
let's start with social.

1687
01:19:27,655 --> 01:19:31,241
Okay, so, Mike,
my perception of you,

1688
01:19:31,275 --> 01:19:34,482
from the outside looking in, is
that you're a man of integrity,

1689
01:19:34,517 --> 01:19:36,862
you're a man of honor,
your word means something,

1690
01:19:36,896 --> 01:19:38,862
- you really value a handshake.
- Yeah.

1691
01:19:38,896 --> 01:19:42,931
It appears that you do not want
to lie or deceive in this game.

1692
01:19:42,965 --> 01:19:46,689
Maryanne, my perception of you
is that you're bubbly, young,

1693
01:19:46,724 --> 01:19:49,241
you're talkative,
you're silly and goofy.

1694
01:19:49,275 --> 01:19:50,586
Sometimes you might
take parts of the game

1695
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:53,896
less seriously than others,
is how it appears.

1696
01:19:53,931 --> 01:19:56,137
And, Romeo,
my perception of you is,

1697
01:19:56,172 --> 01:19:59,206
there are times when
you are quiet, more reserved,

1698
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:01,793
you know, scattered with bouts
of frantic paranoia

1699
01:20:01,827 --> 01:20:02,793
and random votes at Tribal.

1700
01:20:02,827 --> 01:20:04,379
So my question, to all of you,

1701
01:20:04,413 --> 01:20:07,655
with that perception, is,
is that accurate?

1702
01:20:07,689 --> 01:20:10,275
Is that accurate of how you
played the game, who you are?

1703
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,931
And if not, what am I missing?
Was there more to it?

1704
01:20:12,965 --> 01:20:15,448
- Mike.
- I think it's a great question.

1705
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,551
Um, I think you described me
pretty well.

1706
01:20:17,586 --> 01:20:19,655
Um, I think I've absolutely
played the game

1707
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:21,482
as honorable
as I could play a game

1708
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:24,448
that is about deception,
about backstabbing.

1709
01:20:24,482 --> 01:20:26,827
There was only one time
I went against my word,

1710
01:20:26,862 --> 01:20:29,482
and that was to Rocksroy, and
I owe him an apology for that,

1711
01:20:29,517 --> 01:20:31,172
but I think
I've played the game true

1712
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:33,068
to how I wanted
to play the game.

1713
01:20:33,103 --> 01:20:34,724
Maryanne.

1714
01:20:34,758 --> 01:20:37,241
So, I agree with almost
all of your perception with me.

1715
01:20:37,275 --> 01:20:39,000
The only part
which I don't agree with

1716
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:41,310
was when you said that I don't
really take the game seriously.

1717
01:20:41,344 --> 01:20:44,137
So, me not taking the game seriously

1718
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:45,896
was actually
a part of my strategy.

1719
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:49,103
When I came into the merge, I
realized that there was a trend.

1720
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:51,689
If you were young,
like under 25, and you seemed

1721
01:20:51,724 --> 01:20:54,034
like you were strategic,
you would be voted out.

1722
01:20:54,068 --> 01:20:57,344
Zach got voted out-- under 25.
Swati got voted out-- under 25.

1723
01:20:57,379 --> 01:20:59,793
Lydia got voted out-- under 25.

1724
01:20:59,827 --> 01:21:01,241
Tori, you were under 25.

1725
01:21:01,275 --> 01:21:02,517
You showed that
you were strategic,

1726
01:21:02,551 --> 01:21:04,586
and you were on the bottom
for the whole time.

1727
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,379
So I basically had to pretend
that I had no strategy,

1728
01:21:07,413 --> 01:21:08,758
and then,
when there were fewer people,

1729
01:21:08,793 --> 01:21:10,758
I'd be able
to start to show my strategy

1730
01:21:10,793 --> 01:21:12,482
further and further in the game.

1731
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:14,724
Romeo.

1732
01:21:14,758 --> 01:21:16,931
So, the only negative word
that you said about me

1733
01:21:16,965 --> 01:21:18,620
was, uh, "paranoid."

1734
01:21:18,655 --> 01:21:20,482
And, at a certain point, I was,

1735
01:21:20,517 --> 01:21:23,517
because, when we got
to the merge of Kula Kula,

1736
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:26,413
I quickly went from
feeling like I was the boss

1737
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:27,862
to the employee.

1738
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:30,379
And I was at the bottom
of every single Tribal Council.

1739
01:21:30,413 --> 01:21:32,413
And the random votes,

1740
01:21:32,448 --> 01:21:34,413
yes, I did do that,
but that was purposely,

1741
01:21:34,448 --> 01:21:37,206
because I didn't want to vote
for the person that was going.

1742
01:21:37,241 --> 01:21:39,689
Chanelle, I knew you were going.
I didn't vote for you.

1743
01:21:39,724 --> 01:21:42,103
Tori, I'm glad that
I didn't have to vote.

1744
01:21:42,137 --> 01:21:43,965
Hai, you saved me,

1745
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,517
and I told you I wasn't gonna
vote for you when you went,

1746
01:21:45,551 --> 01:21:47,068
and I voted for Jonathan. Um...

1747
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:50,793
But your strategy of throwing
hinky votes to rile people up,

1748
01:21:50,827 --> 01:21:52,896
you did that to me,
it succeeded,

1749
01:21:52,931 --> 01:21:54,896
and you proceeded
to gaslight me.

1750
01:21:54,931 --> 01:21:57,310
So, was that part
of your social game?

1751
01:21:57,344 --> 01:21:59,034
No, I did not gaslight you.

1752
01:21:59,068 --> 01:22:00,965
You saved me, and
I didn't want to vote for you.

1753
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,586
I refused to vote for you.
Let me, let me specify.

1754
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:04,137
The gaslighting was
when I asked you

1755
01:22:04,172 --> 01:22:06,551
if you threw the hinky vote
at me at the Chanelle vote-off.

1756
01:22:06,586 --> 01:22:08,034
And you said, "No, I did not."

1757
01:22:08,068 --> 01:22:09,034
Yes.

1758
01:22:09,068 --> 01:22:10,448
So you did gaslight me.

1759
01:22:10,482 --> 01:22:11,827
For that time, yes,

1760
01:22:11,862 --> 01:22:13,103
because you came at me aggressively.

1761
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,724
But you came at me aggressively, too.

1762
01:22:14,758 --> 01:22:17,448
I was just-- I let my feelings
get to me.

1763
01:22:17,482 --> 01:22:18,689
And it-it came from Drea,

1764
01:22:18,724 --> 01:22:20,103
'cause I felt Drea
replaced me with you.

1765
01:22:20,137 --> 01:22:22,413
You were so good
that you... that you were...

1766
01:22:22,448 --> 01:22:23,931
that she replaced me,
and I'm sorry.

1767
01:22:23,965 --> 01:22:25,724
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Thank you for owning that.

1768
01:22:25,758 --> 01:22:26,862
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

1769
01:22:26,896 --> 01:22:28,862
You admitting that
me getting close to Drea

1770
01:22:28,896 --> 01:22:31,068
made you threatened, I respect that.
Yeah. Yeah.

1771
01:22:31,103 --> 01:22:32,586
So thank you for being truthful.

1772
01:22:33,586 --> 01:22:35,413
Anyone else, social?

1773
01:22:35,448 --> 01:22:38,034
Uh, yeah, um, Mike,

1774
01:22:38,068 --> 01:22:40,068
you touted a lot around camp

1775
01:22:40,103 --> 01:22:43,758
about honesty, integrity,
you're a man of your word.

1776
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:46,448
- Yes.
- And you said earlier, is that the only time

1777
01:22:46,482 --> 01:22:48,344
you've ever lied in the game
was to Rocksroy.

1778
01:22:48,379 --> 01:22:51,862
But did you not lie to Drea
on the beach

1779
01:22:51,896 --> 01:22:54,551
about going after Romeo
to make her feel comfortable?

1780
01:22:54,586 --> 01:22:58,724
And you said, "Omar,
we got to vote out Drea.

1781
01:22:58,758 --> 01:23:01,586
You know I'm just trying to make her comfortable, right?"

1782
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,137
Well, I never purposely

1783
01:23:03,172 --> 01:23:05,689
sacrificed my integrity,
but there were times

1784
01:23:05,724 --> 01:23:08,862
that I had to do things
that maybe I didn't want to do.

1785
01:23:08,896 --> 01:23:10,862
I had to protect myself.

1786
01:23:10,896 --> 01:23:13,517
That's honor for myself, also.

1787
01:23:13,551 --> 01:23:16,413
Mike, I don't think
I hear you owning up

1788
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:18,310
to what we're asking you. Okay.

1789
01:23:18,344 --> 01:23:19,896
And so, I just want to kind of

1790
01:23:19,931 --> 01:23:21,448
- really dig in.
- Okay.

1791
01:23:21,482 --> 01:23:24,448
How many people in this game
did you shake their hands,

1792
01:23:24,482 --> 01:23:26,827
did you look in their eyes,
did you give your word,

1793
01:23:26,862 --> 01:23:28,586
and then did
you lie to their faces?

1794
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:29,896
I'm gonna be honest,

1795
01:23:29,931 --> 01:23:32,103
there's only one person
that I shook their hand

1796
01:23:32,137 --> 01:23:34,000
and said something,
and that was Rocksroy.

1797
01:23:34,034 --> 01:23:36,689
Everybody else,
I absolutely kept my word,

1798
01:23:36,724 --> 01:23:40,724
and, until, no, no,
until they deceived me first.

1799
01:23:40,758 --> 01:23:42,034
And I'll explain what happened.

1800
01:23:42,068 --> 01:23:44,206
Rocksroy says to me,
I say to him,

1801
01:23:44,241 --> 01:23:46,206
"Is this easy as it is?"
We shook hands.

1802
01:23:46,241 --> 01:23:47,517
I said, "I'm voting Romeo."

1803
01:23:47,551 --> 01:23:49,172
At the last minute,
you came up to me and said,

1804
01:23:49,206 --> 01:23:51,000
"Listen, we have
to vote Rocksroy off."

1805
01:23:51,034 --> 01:23:52,172
I said,
"I can't vote Rocksroy off.

1806
01:23:52,206 --> 01:23:53,586
I just told him
I wasn't voting him off."

1807
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:55,068
And you said, "No, we have to."

1808
01:23:55,103 --> 01:23:57,068
I said, "If we're in an alliance
and I'm your number one,

1809
01:23:57,103 --> 01:23:59,655
"how come I didn't know
until 30 minutes prior

1810
01:23:59,689 --> 01:24:00,896
to us going to a Tribal?"

1811
01:24:00,931 --> 01:24:02,827
You shook my hand,
and you blindsided me.

1812
01:24:02,862 --> 01:24:04,793
I was never deceitful. Your words are...
Yes, but then, okay.

1813
01:24:04,827 --> 01:24:07,068
So you're telling me
that you weren't deceitful?

1814
01:24:07,103 --> 01:24:09,310
- Then-then I...
- I think somebody else might have lied to you.

1815
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,034
You don't realize that Omar was
lying to you the entire time?

1816
01:24:12,068 --> 01:24:14,137
But then you weren't talking to me.
Yes, I was, Mike.

1817
01:24:14,172 --> 01:24:16,034
I didn't even know you were
in an alliance with them.

1818
01:24:16,068 --> 01:24:17,379
I told you.

1819
01:24:17,413 --> 01:24:19,379
It kind of comes down to,
anybody who's aligned with you

1820
01:24:19,413 --> 01:24:21,551
is not allowed
to talk to other people...

1821
01:24:21,586 --> 01:24:24,275
- Mm.
- ...when that's how people get information

1822
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:26,827
to be able to give you,
yet you are allowed

1823
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:29,206
to talk to lots of different
people and have one-on-ones.

1824
01:24:29,241 --> 01:24:31,517
And that's where
it seems inconsistent.

1825
01:24:31,551 --> 01:24:33,275
That's true.
But was that the strategy?

1826
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,655
We're trying to understand,
was that strategy,

1827
01:24:34,689 --> 01:24:35,689
or was that just like...?
It was.

1828
01:24:35,724 --> 01:24:37,172
It was absolutely strategy
to use

1829
01:24:37,206 --> 01:24:39,172
my social game for the alliance
I was in and for myself

1830
01:24:39,206 --> 01:24:41,068
to advance in the game.
Okay, but you just claimed

1831
01:24:41,103 --> 01:24:45,344
that your game was to be honest
and have dignity.

1832
01:24:45,379 --> 01:24:48,034
That is not what
it's sounding like, Mike.

1833
01:24:48,068 --> 01:24:50,206
- You need to own your game.
- Well... I am, I'm saying it right now.

1834
01:24:50,241 --> 01:24:52,034
I just want to,
I just want us to settle down

1835
01:24:52,068 --> 01:24:53,379
because we all lied to people.

1836
01:24:53,413 --> 01:24:58,206
Mike, I actually think
your social game was on point.

1837
01:24:58,241 --> 01:25:00,896
You were very social
with everyone.

1838
01:25:00,931 --> 01:25:03,482
And kudos to you,
as a 57-year-old,

1839
01:25:03,517 --> 01:25:06,034
staying in the talks
with all of us--

1840
01:25:06,068 --> 01:25:07,862
people who are half your age
most of the time.

1841
01:25:07,896 --> 01:25:11,344
Thank you. Fortunately my social
game is what I am in real life.

1842
01:25:11,379 --> 01:25:13,586
I'm a very social person.
I like people.

1843
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:14,758
I want to know
what makes them tick.

1844
01:25:14,793 --> 01:25:16,896
And you guys
opened up your world to me,

1845
01:25:16,931 --> 01:25:18,551
introducing me to places, cultures,

1846
01:25:18,586 --> 01:25:21,206
religions that I never knew
before, and I just ate it up.

1847
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:24,068
So when I talk to people,
people like me,

1848
01:25:24,103 --> 01:25:26,827
and they would just come up
to me and give me information.

1849
01:25:26,862 --> 01:25:29,206
I-I respect that,
'cause your social game

1850
01:25:29,241 --> 01:25:30,724
is the reason I went home,
straight up.

1851
01:25:30,758 --> 01:25:32,241
Like, it saved you.

1852
01:25:32,275 --> 01:25:33,551
Thank you.

1853
01:25:33,586 --> 01:25:35,655
- I have a question for you, Maryanne.
- Mm-hmm.

1854
01:25:35,689 --> 01:25:38,517
At Taku,
I felt that your social game

1855
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:41,241
put you on the bottom.

1856
01:25:41,275 --> 01:25:45,413
Did you realize
that your sloppy social game

1857
01:25:45,448 --> 01:25:46,862
was putting you in danger,

1858
01:25:46,896 --> 01:25:50,172
and did you do anything to
change that later in the game?

1859
01:25:50,206 --> 01:25:52,103
Yep. And I can understand that,

1860
01:25:52,137 --> 01:25:53,379
and thank you
for pointing it out

1861
01:25:53,413 --> 01:25:54,965
and giving me the chance
to explain my social game.

1862
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,034
To be completely honest,

1863
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:59,965
I didn't realize that
my social game was as sloppy

1864
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,586
as I thought it was
until the fake merge.

1865
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:03,655
I truly was sitting there,

1866
01:26:03,689 --> 01:26:05,413
being like, "Wow,
I'm doing such a great job.

1867
01:26:05,448 --> 01:26:07,034
I'm living such a great life."

1868
01:26:07,068 --> 01:26:08,241
And, like,
I'm gonna be honest about that.

1869
01:26:08,275 --> 01:26:10,310
Like, I feel
as if that's because

1870
01:26:10,344 --> 01:26:11,344
when I got comfortable,
I started to play

1871
01:26:11,379 --> 01:26:12,413
a little bit more emotionally.

1872
01:26:12,448 --> 01:26:13,724
When I play emotionally,

1873
01:26:13,758 --> 01:26:15,448
I'm someone where I love
to tell everyone everything.

1874
01:26:15,482 --> 01:26:17,931
And you literally
can't do that on <i>Survivor.</i>

1875
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:19,241
Does that answer your question?

1876
01:26:19,275 --> 01:26:21,206
- Yeah.
- I want to piggyback off of that.

1877
01:26:21,241 --> 01:26:23,517
Mm-hmm.
Was there any particular people

1878
01:26:23,551 --> 01:26:26,068
that you were
able to draw in yourself

1879
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:29,103
for a vote,
or just for an alliance?

1880
01:26:29,137 --> 01:26:31,310
The person who I feel
I specifically went

1881
01:26:31,344 --> 01:26:34,413
and drew in for a vote
was Romeo at your vote, Omar,

1882
01:26:34,448 --> 01:26:37,172
because Romeo and I were kind of
working back and forth together,

1883
01:26:37,206 --> 01:26:41,000
and you two were very gung ho
already about voting Omar out.

1884
01:26:41,034 --> 01:26:43,275
- So it was time to take out Omar. But the...
- Hold on.

1885
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:45,482
- That's not... That's not how you knew.
- Yeah.

1886
01:26:45,517 --> 01:26:49,310
- I told Mike to team up with you to take Omar out.
- Yeah.

1887
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:52,034
This wasn't a move
that you came up with.

1888
01:26:52,068 --> 01:26:54,241
Yes, you two did go
and think of it first,

1889
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:55,517
but I can tell you and promise

1890
01:26:55,551 --> 01:26:57,137
that I was
already thinking about it.

1891
01:26:57,172 --> 01:26:59,724
I was deciding whether
I'd take him out at six or five,

1892
01:26:59,758 --> 01:27:03,000
and I will agree that Mike and
you talking to me is what said,

1893
01:27:03,034 --> 01:27:04,517
"Okay, it needs to be at six."

1894
01:27:04,551 --> 01:27:05,689
Okay.

1895
01:27:05,724 --> 01:27:08,896
So I want to hear
the same thing from Romeo.

1896
01:27:08,931 --> 01:27:12,172
What is a big social move
that you did, Romeo?

1897
01:27:12,206 --> 01:27:15,413
So, for me, I'm more
of a one-on-one conversation,

1898
01:27:15,448 --> 01:27:16,689
as opposed to
sitting around camp

1899
01:27:16,724 --> 01:27:18,655
and just speaking out loud
in front of groups.

1900
01:27:18,689 --> 01:27:19,827
That's not what I do.

1901
01:27:19,862 --> 01:27:21,931
Back home,
I work with women one-on-one,

1902
01:27:21,965 --> 01:27:24,379
and that's what I did with each
and every one of you,

1903
01:27:24,413 --> 01:27:26,620
I felt like, whether I was
in alliance with you or not,

1904
01:27:26,655 --> 01:27:27,965
I had a relationship.

1905
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,068
So, to answer your question,
that was my social move--

1906
01:27:30,103 --> 01:27:32,000
making alliances
with every single person.

1907
01:27:32,034 --> 01:27:33,344
- Okay. Got it.
- Like I made with you.

1908
01:27:33,379 --> 01:27:35,344
Like I made
with Omar and Maryanne.

1909
01:27:35,379 --> 01:27:36,758
Like I made with Drea and Rocks.

1910
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:38,931
Like I made
with every single person.

1911
01:27:41,413 --> 01:27:42,448
All right, I'm gonna move this

1912
01:27:42,482 --> 01:27:44,482
into the physical part
of the game.

1913
01:27:44,517 --> 01:27:48,517
Rocksroy, I can't think of a Survivor in recent memory...

1914
01:27:48,551 --> 01:27:51,482
- ...who's enjoyed the physical part of the game as much as you.
- Yeah, buddy.

1915
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:54,206
- Yeah.
- So why don't you get us started in this section?

1916
01:27:54,241 --> 01:27:57,896
Uh, one of the things I noticed
is, uh, for a lot of players

1917
01:27:57,931 --> 01:27:59,793
this year, is just basic skills.

1918
01:27:59,827 --> 01:28:02,448
Doing physical work,
building a shelter,

1919
01:28:02,482 --> 01:28:04,413
identifying plants or whatever.

1920
01:28:04,448 --> 01:28:07,344
What skills did you guys think
you brought to the game?

1921
01:28:07,379 --> 01:28:08,793
Maryanne?

1922
01:28:08,827 --> 01:28:11,310
So, one of the things which
I did was weave palm fronds.

1923
01:28:11,344 --> 01:28:13,827
So, when we were all still gung
ho about weaving palm fronds,

1924
01:28:13,862 --> 01:28:15,689
I showed most of my tribe,
"Hey, this is how we weave it."

1925
01:28:15,724 --> 01:28:17,034
And I also used it
for other things.

1926
01:28:17,068 --> 01:28:19,103
I made Omar's prayer mat.
This is just an example

1927
01:28:19,137 --> 01:28:20,586
to show that
I weave palm fronds.

1928
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:22,000
Another thing
which I knew how to do

1929
01:28:22,034 --> 01:28:25,482
was, I was very, very good
at scaling and gutting fish.

1930
01:28:25,517 --> 01:28:28,724
My family were-were Luo--
which is a tribe from Kenya--

1931
01:28:28,758 --> 01:28:30,172
and we love eating tilapia.

1932
01:28:30,206 --> 01:28:31,793
So when you buy it in, like,
little buckets of it,

1933
01:28:31,827 --> 01:28:34,344
you have to individually
scale them and gut them.

1934
01:28:34,379 --> 01:28:36,827
So I've always been growing up,
watching my mom doing this.

1935
01:28:36,862 --> 01:28:38,862
So, even though
I can't catch a fish,

1936
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:40,793
I can go and be like, "Thank you
for bringing this fish.

1937
01:28:40,827 --> 01:28:43,275
I'm going to prepare it so
you don't have to do that work."

1938
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:44,586
Mike.

1939
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:45,827
Um, I think
the most important thing,

1940
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:48,034
in regards to strength,
is my work ethic.

1941
01:28:48,068 --> 01:28:51,896
I didn't stop moving once
in the 26 days I was out here.

1942
01:28:51,931 --> 01:28:53,586
Every single time something
was needed to be done,

1943
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,965
even if I didn't know
how to do it. I cut bamboo.

1944
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,034
I went and got wood. I built.

1945
01:28:58,068 --> 01:29:01,310
You are the only reason
we had a merge shelter.

1946
01:29:01,344 --> 01:29:02,862
It was incredible
to watch you work

1947
01:29:02,896 --> 01:29:04,310
- the first two weeks of Vati.
- And I got to be honest with you,

1948
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:05,655
I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.

1949
01:29:05,689 --> 01:29:07,862
It was fantastic,
and you did it so fast.

1950
01:29:07,896 --> 01:29:09,310
- Yeah. It was a nice shelter.
- Yeah.

1951
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,344
Thank you. Romeo.

1952
01:29:10,379 --> 01:29:13,034
So I'm gonna
be honest with everyone.

1953
01:29:13,068 --> 01:29:15,896
I've never been camping
a day in my life.

1954
01:29:15,931 --> 01:29:18,551
I just learned how to swim
to come out on <i>Survivor.</i>

1955
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:19,862
I-I was just...
That was very impressive

1956
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,896
considering
you just learned how to swim.

1957
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:23,655
I thought you did really, really well.
I was, I was not...

1958
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:24,758
Number one,
I'm terrified of heights.

1959
01:29:24,793 --> 01:29:25,862
And I just learned how to swim.

1960
01:29:25,896 --> 01:29:26,931
And now I have to do both,

1961
01:29:26,965 --> 01:29:28,896
and on national TV,
in my underwear.

1962
01:29:28,931 --> 01:29:30,172
So, I'm like...

1963
01:29:30,206 --> 01:29:33,241
And you hate hearing Jeff say,
"Romeo dead last."

1964
01:29:33,275 --> 01:29:36,551
And-- but-but that last challenge,

1965
01:29:36,586 --> 01:29:38,379
I knew I was gonna win.
I didn't care what it was.

1966
01:29:38,413 --> 01:29:40,310
I was like,
"I'm not leaving <i>Survivor</i>

1967
01:29:40,344 --> 01:29:42,758
without my dream
of wearing that necklace."

1968
01:29:42,793 --> 01:29:45,344
And I pulled it through, and I,
and I was so proud of myself.

1969
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:47,931
And I think that was the most
important immunity challenge,

1970
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:49,724
'cause it gave me power.

1971
01:29:49,758 --> 01:29:51,344
And it felt good
to have power in this game,

1972
01:29:51,379 --> 01:29:55,068
so it meant the world to me.

1973
01:29:56,103 --> 01:29:57,655
All right,
let's move into strategy.

1974
01:29:57,689 --> 01:30:00,586
So, my vote, just so you know,

1975
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:04,275
is off of game strategy--
how you played this game.

1976
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:07,034
So I want to know
what your biggest move

1977
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:11,655
that you did on your own,
in this game, was.

1978
01:30:11,689 --> 01:30:12,862
Um, Romeo.

1979
01:30:12,896 --> 01:30:15,793
For me, my game
quickly shifted into,

1980
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:18,551
unfortunately,
a self-preservation game,

1981
01:30:18,586 --> 01:30:21,448
'cause my name
was always at the bottom.

1982
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:23,103
I had to make as many alliances
as I could,

1983
01:30:23,137 --> 01:30:25,172
and hopefully
that would push me through,

1984
01:30:25,206 --> 01:30:26,379
and that did.

1985
01:30:26,413 --> 01:30:27,862
But somebody's just gonna say,
"Okay, well,

1986
01:30:27,896 --> 01:30:29,413
we'll take Romeo,
'cause we could beat him."

1987
01:30:29,448 --> 01:30:31,655
So I figure,
"Okay, I need to do something."

1988
01:30:31,689 --> 01:30:35,241
And the first thing was
create a fake immunity idol.

1989
01:30:35,275 --> 01:30:36,896
Whether it worked or didn't,

1990
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,620
that was just to get people's
attention away from me,

1991
01:30:39,655 --> 01:30:40,862
to not vote for me.

1992
01:30:40,896 --> 01:30:43,000
Then the last and final
immunity challenge,

1993
01:30:43,034 --> 01:30:44,310
I knew I had to win,

1994
01:30:44,344 --> 01:30:47,310
to show that nobody carried me
to the final three.

1995
01:30:47,344 --> 01:30:48,517
I put myself there.

1996
01:30:48,551 --> 01:30:50,344
Why did you take Maryanne
to three?

1997
01:30:50,379 --> 01:30:52,034
Mm. Good question.

1998
01:30:52,068 --> 01:30:54,827
I felt that she didn't
have a strategy,

1999
01:30:54,862 --> 01:30:57,482
and my best move was
to bring somebody that was

2000
01:30:57,517 --> 01:30:59,482
perceived
to be playing a similar game.

2001
01:30:59,517 --> 01:31:02,206
And I secured my own fate
by putting myself

2002
01:31:02,241 --> 01:31:06,172
in the final three, and-and...
and the rest is up to you guys.

2003
01:31:06,206 --> 01:31:09,241
Mike, what's something that
you solely did on your own?

2004
01:31:10,241 --> 01:31:11,241
Once we got to the merge,

2005
01:31:11,275 --> 01:31:12,896
I decided to make my big move.

2006
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:15,206
And I thought
Hai was too strong.

2007
01:31:15,241 --> 01:31:17,206
I was nervous
that he was coming at me.

2008
01:31:17,241 --> 01:31:19,620
And I organized
a blindside on Hai.

2009
01:31:19,655 --> 01:31:21,241
And that's when
I started working

2010
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:22,620
with, uh, Lindsay and Omar

2011
01:31:22,655 --> 01:31:24,172
to better my game strategically.

2012
01:31:24,206 --> 01:31:27,620
Do you think you played
an emotionally-charged game,

2013
01:31:27,655 --> 01:31:29,931
or do you think
you played a strategic game?

2014
01:31:29,965 --> 01:31:31,517
I think I played both.

2015
01:31:31,551 --> 01:31:33,000
I think I played
a strategic game,

2016
01:31:33,034 --> 01:31:34,724
but I also think I played
an emotional game, too.

2017
01:31:34,758 --> 01:31:37,241
Sometimes my emotion
got the best of me.

2018
01:31:37,275 --> 01:31:38,689
Um...

2019
01:31:38,724 --> 01:31:41,137
- I'm-
- I'm being told that I gave my word,

2020
01:31:41,172 --> 01:31:42,379
and I, and I went
against it a lot.

2021
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:44,275
Well, if I'm being honest
with you,

2022
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:46,413
maybe I didn't play as much

2023
01:31:46,448 --> 01:31:48,482
with integrity as I thought
I did, to be honest with you.

2024
01:31:48,517 --> 01:31:51,172
And I, maybe I misconstrued
exactly what I was doing.

2025
01:31:51,206 --> 01:31:54,517
But again, you have to say
some stuff that is not true,

2026
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:55,827
or else you're
gonna get steamrolled.

2027
01:31:55,862 --> 01:31:56,896
You're gonna be voted out.

2028
01:31:56,931 --> 01:31:58,758
I would have
been out a long time ago

2029
01:31:58,793 --> 01:32:01,137
if I didn't do what I did--
I know I would have.

2030
01:32:01,172 --> 01:32:04,034
So at seven on, I realized I'm
playing the game of <i>Survivor.</i>

2031
01:32:04,068 --> 01:32:06,620
I used the beginning
of the game to set up that game,

2032
01:32:06,655 --> 01:32:08,310
and then, from seven down,
I played the game

2033
01:32:08,344 --> 01:32:10,586
that I thought that would
best get me to the end.

2034
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,551
Maryanne, I'm really,
really interested

2035
01:32:13,586 --> 01:32:15,379
in what you have to say,
'cause we slept together

2036
01:32:15,413 --> 01:32:16,724
by the fire every night,

2037
01:32:16,758 --> 01:32:18,724
and I don't know what
you really did in the game.

2038
01:32:18,758 --> 01:32:22,724
My one big move
that I did was set myself up

2039
01:32:22,758 --> 01:32:24,689
to be in the final three,
with multiple combinations

2040
01:32:24,724 --> 01:32:27,551
with Omar's vote.
Let me explain to you why.

2041
01:32:27,586 --> 01:32:30,206
When I voted out Omar,
Mike gave me his word

2042
01:32:30,241 --> 01:32:32,931
that he will give me
his idol at the final five,

2043
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:35,068
and that would
guarantee me the final four.

2044
01:32:35,103 --> 01:32:36,482
But then, you know,
you might be like,

2045
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:39,137
"Mike backed on his word.
So, like, how were you so sure?"

2046
01:32:39,172 --> 01:32:42,344
And the reason is, I kept
the only secret in this game.

2047
01:32:42,379 --> 01:32:45,620
I, actually, after your vote,
Tori, had the merge idol.

2048
01:32:45,655 --> 01:32:46,931
I can show it to you right now.

2049
01:32:46,965 --> 01:32:48,896
And I told no one about it.

2050
01:32:48,931 --> 01:32:50,000
You can see it over here.

2051
01:32:50,034 --> 01:32:52,000
Here's the idol.
Here's the note.

2052
01:32:52,034 --> 01:32:54,068
So now we're then
off to my final four

2053
01:32:54,103 --> 01:32:57,275
of Jonathan, Mike, me and Romeo.

2054
01:32:57,310 --> 01:32:59,172
So that meant that if I won,

2055
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:01,551
I'm going to the end,
because I'm not making fire.

2056
01:33:01,586 --> 01:33:04,034
If Mike won, he gave me his word
that I would go to the end.

2057
01:33:04,068 --> 01:33:05,344
If Romeo won,

2058
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:07,068
Romeo was afraid of Mike,
he would take me to the end.

2059
01:33:07,103 --> 01:33:08,655
And if Jonathan won,
he would want to go

2060
01:33:08,689 --> 01:33:11,482
and have that final big move
to take Mike out,

2061
01:33:11,517 --> 01:33:12,965
and Romeo and I
would be at the end.

2062
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,344
By taking you out, Omar,

2063
01:33:14,379 --> 01:33:16,758
I gave myself the best position
to be sitting here.

2064
01:33:19,034 --> 01:33:20,034
Touché.

2065
01:33:20,068 --> 01:33:21,620
I have a question.

2066
01:33:21,655 --> 01:33:23,034
What's your story

2067
01:33:23,068 --> 01:33:25,034
of your personal evolution
playing this game?

2068
01:33:25,068 --> 01:33:26,482
Like, what did you learn
about yourself?

2069
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:28,000
Romeo, I'd like you to start.

2070
01:33:28,034 --> 01:33:30,034
Um, I felt like,

2071
01:33:30,068 --> 01:33:32,517
for at least
the second part of this game,

2072
01:33:32,551 --> 01:33:35,310
I was holding on
by the skin of my teeth.

2073
01:33:35,344 --> 01:33:39,000
And back home I would say,

2074
01:33:39,034 --> 01:33:40,965
"Screw it. Let me just
try something else."

2075
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,689
But out here,
I couldn't do that

2076
01:33:42,724 --> 01:33:46,689
because I was not just
representing me.

2077
01:33:54,793 --> 01:33:57,103
That was not the game
I wanted to play.

2078
01:33:57,137 --> 01:33:58,724
I didn't want to play
from the bottom,

2079
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:00,482
but that was the game
that was dealt to me.

2080
01:34:00,517 --> 01:34:04,137
And I-I-I... and I saw
an opening and a window

2081
01:34:04,172 --> 01:34:06,137
for these two people
that were going to play with me.

2082
01:34:06,172 --> 01:34:07,482
And then, the next vote,

2083
01:34:07,517 --> 01:34:08,862
these three people want
to play with me.

2084
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,275
And then this person was gone,
so then

2085
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:12,000
I had to find another person,
and I just kept going

2086
01:34:12,034 --> 01:34:14,034
until I won that final immunity,

2087
01:34:14,068 --> 01:34:15,793
and that's what I'm going
to take away from this game,

2088
01:34:15,827 --> 01:34:19,586
is, no matter
how hard this game was--

2089
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:21,137
and I can tell this
to the girls

2090
01:34:21,172 --> 01:34:23,275
that I work with,
empowering back home--

2091
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:25,068
I didn't give up.

2092
01:34:25,103 --> 01:34:29,000
I didn't give up.
I'm leaving this game

2093
01:34:29,034 --> 01:34:31,344
as a free man
who will no longer have to hide

2094
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:33,689
because I'm scared
of what people might think--

2095
01:34:33,724 --> 01:34:35,344
even my religious family
back home--

2096
01:34:35,379 --> 01:34:37,793
just because I'm gay,
and they won't accept me.

2097
01:34:37,827 --> 01:34:40,793
I'm going to... I'm going
to leave this game as a free man

2098
01:34:40,827 --> 01:34:45,379
to live my life the way I wanted
to live since I was 19.

2099
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:47,793
And it took me
in my 30s to figure it out.

2100
01:34:47,827 --> 01:34:49,482
And just a quick shout-out
to you

2101
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:52,275
for making me comfortable
to do that.

2102
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:54,551
Thank you.
Thank you. Mike?

2103
01:34:54,586 --> 01:34:57,172
So, for me, I think
that I proved that

2104
01:34:57,206 --> 01:34:58,793
people that are older,
like myself

2105
01:34:58,827 --> 01:35:01,172
and Rocksroy, can come out here,

2106
01:35:01,206 --> 01:35:03,862
compete in the game,
play the game hard,

2107
01:35:03,896 --> 01:35:07,034
and get along
with the younger generation,

2108
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:09,137
which sometimes is not so easy.

2109
01:35:09,172 --> 01:35:12,206
For myself, I-I learned that

2110
01:35:12,241 --> 01:35:14,034
I can still do what I thought
I couldn't do anymore.

2111
01:35:14,068 --> 01:35:17,413
You know, I-I-I talked a lot
about my kids, and it just...

2112
01:35:17,448 --> 01:35:19,551
For my kids
to see me come out here

2113
01:35:19,586 --> 01:35:23,241
and do what I did
and... and-and compete

2114
01:35:23,275 --> 01:35:26,620
and-and... and succeed
to a certain level,

2115
01:35:26,655 --> 01:35:28,344
that they would see
that they can do anything

2116
01:35:28,379 --> 01:35:29,620
that they've put their mind
to it,

2117
01:35:29,655 --> 01:35:31,034
and that there was no...

2118
01:35:31,068 --> 01:35:32,689
There's no boundaries
as to what they can accomplish

2119
01:35:32,724 --> 01:35:34,172
in their life.

2120
01:35:34,206 --> 01:35:36,586
So that's what I learned
about myself.

2121
01:35:38,103 --> 01:35:39,517
Maryanne?
So,

2122
01:35:39,551 --> 01:35:42,448
the thing which I really learned
about myself is that,

2123
01:35:42,482 --> 01:35:44,344
a lot of times we talk about
how <i>Survivor</i> breaks you down,

2124
01:35:44,379 --> 01:35:45,689
how it takes your insecurities.

2125
01:35:45,724 --> 01:35:48,413
And I realized, I,
with the Omar vote,

2126
01:35:48,448 --> 01:35:50,586
made my path to the end.

2127
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,655
But there was a chance that
I was going to lose the game

2128
01:35:52,689 --> 01:35:54,034
and not know why.

2129
01:35:54,068 --> 01:35:56,793
So then I started
to self-sabotage myself.

2130
01:35:56,827 --> 01:35:58,655
I really wanted
to bring Lindsay to the end,

2131
01:35:58,689 --> 01:36:00,793
but in my mind, I'm like,
"I cannot beat Lindsay."

2132
01:36:00,827 --> 01:36:02,310
'Cause that means
that I wanted to go

2133
01:36:02,344 --> 01:36:03,655
and give myself an easy out

2134
01:36:03,689 --> 01:36:05,000
because I didn't want

2135
01:36:05,034 --> 01:36:07,620
to feel that rejection
of friendship.

2136
01:36:07,655 --> 01:36:09,896
Even recently in my life,
a couple years ago,

2137
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:12,793
someone spread a rumor about me,
and I lost so many friends,

2138
01:36:12,827 --> 01:36:14,689
and I didn't want
to feel that again.

2139
01:36:14,724 --> 01:36:17,931
I kind of knew
that that's how I self-sabotage.

2140
01:36:17,965 --> 01:36:19,965
Like, when I was young,
I used to push people away

2141
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,965
so they couldn't go
and hurt me first.

2142
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,620
And it's like,
to know that I'd do it

2143
01:36:23,655 --> 01:36:26,275
in something that I love, too,
it's like, it shows

2144
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:28,034
that I still need
to grow as a person,

2145
01:36:28,068 --> 01:36:30,034
and I'm still growing,
which is why, like,

2146
01:36:30,068 --> 01:36:31,448
I'm still proud of myself.

2147
01:36:31,482 --> 01:36:33,344
Because I really,
really was so, so close

2148
01:36:33,379 --> 01:36:34,827
to playing my idol for you,

2149
01:36:34,862 --> 01:36:37,448
like, before we went to Tribal.
But I'm like, "Maryanne,

2150
01:36:37,482 --> 01:36:39,931
you need to grow and you need
to make yourself open." Like,

2151
01:36:39,965 --> 01:36:43,034
I knew that I still had
to take that chance to lose

2152
01:36:43,068 --> 01:36:46,586
because I deserve
that chance to win.

2153
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:51,241
Thank you.
Thank you for your transparency.

2154
01:36:51,275 --> 01:36:54,689
Jury, I have to say,
one of the best

2155
01:36:54,724 --> 01:36:57,241
final Tribals
that I can remember.

2156
01:36:57,275 --> 01:36:59,137
You held them accountable, but

2157
01:36:59,172 --> 01:37:00,862
you were always respectful
and at times

2158
01:37:00,896 --> 01:37:02,862
even encouraging
and inspiring them

2159
01:37:02,896 --> 01:37:04,241
to try to give a better answer.

2160
01:37:04,275 --> 01:37:07,034
And, Romeo, Maryanne and Mike,
you did a great job.

2161
01:37:07,068 --> 01:37:08,724
It's very hard to sit over there

2162
01:37:08,758 --> 01:37:10,379
and take that from them,

2163
01:37:10,413 --> 01:37:11,793
- but that is what you want.
- Very hard.

2164
01:37:11,827 --> 01:37:14,965
You want the opportunity
for them to grill you,

2165
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,448
and I think all three of you
held yourself in really

2166
01:37:17,482 --> 01:37:19,862
high regard. You should be
very proud of yourselves.

2167
01:37:19,896 --> 01:37:21,931
- We're going to take a moment.
- Thank you guys.

2168
01:37:21,965 --> 01:37:23,137
We're going
to let the jury take in

2169

Thanks.

01:39:24,137 --> 01:39:27,551
BE EASY SEASON OF SURVIVOR.
THERE'S NOT AN EASY DAY OF

2179
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:30,137
SURVIVOR.
YOU COULD ARGUE THERE IS NOT AN

2180
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:33,827
EASY MINUTE OF SURVIVOR.
YOU ARE STRIPPED OF EVERYTHING.

2181
01:39:33,862 --> 01:39:37,413
DROPPED IN A JUNGLE WITH A BUNCH
OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TAKE YOU

2182
01:39:37,448 --> 01:39:38,724
OUT.
AND YOU DID IT.

2183
01:39:38,758 --> 01:39:41,000
YOU MADE IT TO THE FINAL THREE.
NOW ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW IS WHO

2184
01:39:41,034 --> 01:39:43,896

THERE IS ONE MORE TWIST THIS

2185
01:39:43,931 --> 01:39:45,793
SEASON.

2186
01:39:45,827 --> 01:39:47,655
OH WOW.
Probst: BECAUSE WE SHOOT

01:39:47,689 --> 01:39:50,965
OUR SEASONS BACK TO BACK YOU

2188
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,241
HAPPENED IN SURVIVOR 41.
AND WHAT WE DID IN SURVIVOR 41

2189
01:39:55,275 --> 01:40:01,172
WAS WE READ THE VOTES IN THE
JUNGLE OF FIJI AND THAT'S WHAT

2190
01:40:01,206 --> 01:40:05,137
WE ARE GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW.
NO!

2191
01:40:05,172 --> 01:40:07,310
Probst: WE'RE GOING TO READ
THESE VOTES.

2192
01:40:07,344 --> 01:40:10,275
WE'RE GOING TO FIND THE WINNER
OF SURVIVOR 42.

2193
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:13,551
ARE WE READY?
YEAH!

2194
01:40:13,586 --> 01:40:15,758
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK.

2195
01:40:15,793 --> 01:40:18,103

01:41:01,724 --> 01:41:05,896
MARIANNE, WITH FIVE, THAT'S

2203
01:41:05,931 --> 01:41:10,241
CHEESIER CHEESIER.
Probst: COME ON OVER, JURY,

2204
01:41:10,275 --> 01:41:13,379
COME ON OVER.
WHAT ELSE THEY DON'T KNOW IS

2205
01:41:13,413 --> 01:41:15,379
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING A
SURVIVOR AFTER SHOW WITH

2206
01:41:15,413 --> 01:41:17,758
EVERYBODY RIGHT NOW.
WHICH WE ALSO DID LAST SEASON.

2207
01:41:17,793 --> 01:41:21,620
BRING OUT THE CHAMPAGNE.
BRING IN THE SIGNS.

2208
01:41:21,655 --> 01:41:26,137
LET'S BRING IT ALL IN.
THIS IS THE BEST PART.

2209
01:41:26,172 --> 01:41:27,413
THE SURPRISE OF SHOOTING BACK TO
BACK SEASONS THEY DIDN'T KNOW

2210
01:41:27,448 --> 01:41:30,413
EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
WE WILL BRING A COUPLE CAMERAS

2211
01:41:30,448 --> 01:41:32,482
AROUND, BRING IN MORE FIRE.
WHEN WE COME BACK WE WILL HAVE

2212
01:41:32,517 --> 01:41:38,724
EVERYBODY HERE AND WHEN THEY ARE
STILL IN THIS GREAT RAW ENERGY,

2213
01:41:38,758 --> 01:41:40,655
I WILL TAKE SOME CHAMPAGNE RIGHT HERE.

2214
01:41:40,689 --> 01:41:42,758
SURVIVOR 42 AFTER PARTY COMING
UP AFTER THIS.

2215
01:41:59,896 --> 01:42:02,448
Probst: ALL RIGHT, SO WE
ARE STILL IN THE JUNGLES OF

2216
01:42:02,482 --> 01:42:05,655
FIJI.
WE'VE JUST CROWNED OUR WINNER,

2217
01:42:05,689 --> 01:42:09,482
23 YEAR OLD MARYANNE WHO JUST
WON SURVIVOR 42.

2218
01:42:09,517 --> 01:42:13,620
ONE OF THE YOUNGER WINNERS IN
OUR 42 SEASONS.

2219
01:42:13,655 --> 01:42:17,551
LET'S START WITH YOU.
WHAT IS THIS FEELING RIGHT NOW?

2220
01:42:17,586 --> 01:42:21,103
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT
TO ASK THE JURY, I THINK THEY

2221
01:42:21,137 --> 01:42:23,517
CAME IN UNDECIDED.
I THINK YOU SWAYED THEM TONIGHT.

2222
01:42:23,551 --> 01:42:27,241
DID YOU FEEL THAT HAPPENING?
AT FIRST I FELT AS IF I

2223
01:42:27,275 --> 01:42:30,413
WASN'T BEING ASKED QUESTIONS AND
THAT WAS DEMORALIZING BECAUSE

2224
01:42:30,448 --> 01:42:34,413
OH, THEY EITHER KNOW MY STORY
AND THAT SAY GOOD THING OR THEY

2225
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:37,344
DON'T WANT TO KNOW MY STORY AND
THAT IS A GOOD THING BUT

2226
01:42:37,379 --> 01:42:41,103
HONESTLY I KNEW THE PIVOTAL
MOMENTS WAS TELL BEING THE IDOL

2227
01:42:41,137 --> 01:42:43,586
AND HOW I SET MYSELF IN THE END,
I KNEW COMPARED TO OTHER PEOPLE

2228
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:45,620
ON THE JURY I DIDN'T REALLY PLAN
A BIG STRATEGIC GAME, I WILL TO

2229
01:42:45,655 --> 01:42:50,241
PROVE I WAS HERE TO PLAY, NOT
JUST TO GET TO THE END.

2230
01:42:50,275 --> 01:42:54,206
I WANTED-- TO BE THE 40th
WINNER OF THE SHOW IS, LIKE I

2231
01:42:54,241 --> 01:42:56,965
STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.

2232
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,413
Probst: CLARIFYING BECAUSE
TWO PEOPLE HAVE WON TWICE.

2233
01:43:00,448 --> 01:43:02,724
YES, SORRY.
Probst: SHOW OF HANDS, WHO

2234
01:43:02,758 --> 01:43:09,517
HERE CAME IN UNDECIDED?
OKAY, SO VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY.

2235
01:43:09,551 --> 01:43:13,344
WHEN HAI WHEN YOU SAY UNDECIDED
WERE YOU SWAYED BY MARYANNEOR

2236
01:43:13,379 --> 01:43:17,103
LEANING ONE WAY THE OTHER.
I DON'T WANT MY SHIRT TO

2237
01:43:17,137 --> 01:43:18,655
THROW YOU OFF.
I WAS UNDECIDED MOSTLY BECAUSE

2238
01:43:18,689 --> 01:43:21,482
WE DIDN'T WORKING TO FOR A LARGE
PART OF THE GAME.

2239
01:43:21,517 --> 01:43:24,931
AND WE ALL CAME IN WANTING TO
KNOW YOUR STRATEGY.

2240
01:43:24,965 --> 01:43:27,275
BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY ELUSIVE TO
A LOT OF US.

2241
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:30,275
SAME WITH ROMEO.
I THINK MIKE WAS A LITTLE MORE

2242
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:31,862
VISIBLE.
BUT FOR US WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU

2243
01:43:31,896 --> 01:43:34,172
AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

2244
01:43:34,206 --> 01:43:37,000
AND YOU DID IT SO ELOQUENTLY.
Probst: SO DREA WITH SO

2245
01:43:37,034 --> 01:43:41,620
MANY PEOPLE COMING IN UNDECIDED,
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED?

2246
01:43:41,655 --> 01:43:43,275
BECAUSE IT WAS A 7-1 VOTE, THE
OTHER TWO VOTES WERE MARY ANN'S

2247
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:45,448
AS WELL.
RIGHT, I THINK, AND I KNOW IT

2248
01:43:45,482 --> 01:43:48,724
CAME OFF AS IF I WAS COMING OFF HARSH.

2249
01:43:48,758 --> 01:43:52,344
BUT WE KNEW THAT MIKE HAD BEEN
PLAYING THE GAME SINCE DAY ONE.

2250
01:43:52,379 --> 01:43:56,172
SO I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE HER
THE HARD QUESTIONS SO SHE COULD

2251
01:43:56,206 --> 01:43:57,551
EXPLAIN HERSELF IN DETAIL.
Probst: WAS THERE ANYBODY

2252
01:43:57,586 --> 01:44:03,034
WHO WAS LEANING TOWARD MIKE THAT
GOT SWAYED BY MARYANNE?

2253
01:44:03,068 --> 01:44:05,620
ME.
Probst: REALLY?

2254
01:44:05,655 --> 01:44:11,172
SO ROCKSROY, TORI, LINDSAY, A
LITTLE BIT OMAR AND WERE ALL

2255
01:44:11,206 --> 01:44:13,724
LEANING MIKE.
WAS IT THAT MIKE FALTERED AT THE

2256
01:44:13,758 --> 01:44:17,034
END OR MARYANNE STEPPED UP.
FOR ME IT WAS TWO FACTORS.

2257
01:44:17,068 --> 01:44:20,241
ONE IS THAT MIKE PLAYED A MORE
OBVIOUSLY STRATEGIC GAME.

2258
01:44:20,275 --> 01:44:23,172
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS REALLY
LIKING FOR MIKE WAS YEAH, I

2259
01:44:23,206 --> 01:44:26,310
PLAYED THE HONOR, I PLAYED THE
INTEGRITIES CARD BUT I WAS

2260
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:29,620
PLAYING TO WIN THE WHOLE TIME.
AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I GOT

2261
01:44:29,655 --> 01:44:30,931
THAT.
WHEREAS MARYANNE I WAS REALLY

2262
01:44:30,965 --> 01:44:33,482
TIGHT WITH HER FROM THE START,
HER STRATEGIC MIND WAS BRILLIANT

2263
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:36,724
BUT I NEVER SAW THE EXECUTION
UNTIL SHE PULLED OUT THAT I HAD

2264
01:44:36,758 --> 01:44:39,862
A BACKUP PLAN AT FINAL FIVE AND
THAT IDOL THAT EVERYBODY IS

2265
01:44:39,896 --> 01:44:41,896
ELUSIVELY LOOKING FOR, SHE HAD
IT FOR AWHILE.

2266
01:44:41,931 --> 01:44:45,206
SO THAT REALLY CINCHED THE DEAL
FOR ME.

2267
01:44:45,241 --> 01:44:47,517
IT WAS A COMBINATION OF MIKE
LOSING IT AND MARYANNE SNATCHING

2268
01:44:47,551 --> 01:44:50,931
IT RIGHT AT THE VERY END.
Probst: MIKE, LET'S TALK

2269
01:44:50,965 --> 01:44:52,275
ABOUT THIS.
YOU JUST HEARD THEM SAY THAT A

2270
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:56,206
LOT OF PEOPLE CAME IN HERE,
LEANING TOWARD YOU.

2271
01:44:56,241 --> 01:45:00,000
AND THEN MARYANNE STEPPED UP AND
TOOK T EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T

2272
01:45:00,034 --> 01:45:01,448
WIN.
YOU FOUND AN IDOL.

2273
01:45:01,482 --> 01:45:05,931
YOU WON AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
YOU WON THE FIRE-MAKING, YOU HIT

2274
01:45:05,965 --> 01:45:09,689
ALMOST ALL OF THE BIG ICONIC
MOMENTS IN SURVIVOR.

2275
01:45:09,724 --> 01:45:13,068
SO WHAT IS THAT FEELING RIGHT
NOW FOR YOU, EVEN AS A

2276
01:45:13,103 --> 01:45:15,137
RUNNER-UP?
SO IT IS IN BETWEENMENT I

2277
01:45:15,172 --> 01:45:18,896
PLAYED SURVIVOR, I PLAYED THE
HARDEST CAN I PLAY, I HAVE NO

2278
01:45:18,931 --> 01:45:23,000
REGRETS AND AFTER HEARING
MARYANNE'S STORY TONIGHT, I

2279
01:45:23,034 --> 01:45:26,758
THINK SHE EARNED IT.
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

2280
01:45:26,793 --> 01:45:28,068
ANIMOSITY.
I AM GOOD, I PLAYED SURVIVOR AT

2281
01:45:28,103 --> 01:45:32,724
THE AGE OF 57 AFTER WATCHING IN
21 YEARS, I DID A LOT OF THINGS

2282
01:45:32,758 --> 01:45:35,275
THAT HONESTLY THAT I WATCHED ON
TV, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

2283
01:45:35,310 --> 01:45:37,517
SO IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR ME TOO,
IT IS.

2284
01:45:37,551 --> 01:45:40,758
Probst: AND ROMEO, ST
ALWAYS HARD WHEN SOMEBODY MAKES

2285
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:42,793
IT THIS DEEP AND DOESN'T GET ANY VOTES.

2286
01:45:42,827 --> 01:45:46,896
WHAT IS THE FEELING YOU HAVE?
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE YOU MOVED A

2287
01:45:46,931 --> 01:45:50,551
LOT OF PEOPLE TONIGHT.
AND PROBABLY GOT CLOSER TO THEIR

2288
01:45:50,586 --> 01:45:52,931
VOTE THAN YOU WERE WHEN YOU
WALKED IN.

2289
01:45:52,965 --> 01:45:55,965
AND I'M SEEING A LOT OF PEOPLE
NODDING RIGHT NOW, DID YOU FEEL

2290
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,275
THAT AS WELL.
COULD YOU FEEL THAT YOU WERE

2291
01:45:57,310 --> 01:46:00,724
MOVING THEM?
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, JEFF, FOR

2292
01:46:00,758 --> 01:46:02,896
ME I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR A
MILLION DOLLARS.

2293
01:46:02,931 --> 01:46:06,241
I CAME HERE TO SEE IF I COULD
OUT, YOU KNOW, MAKE IT TO THE

2294
01:46:06,275 --> 01:46:09,517
END OF SURVIVOR.
AND I DID THAT.

2295
01:46:09,551 --> 01:46:13,655
AND I'M LEAVING THIS GAME WITH
LIFE EXPERIENCES THAT I WOULD

2296
01:46:13,689 --> 01:46:15,551
HAVE NEVER GOTTEN IF I HADN'T
BEEN HERE.

2297
01:46:15,586 --> 01:46:17,965
SO I HAVE NO REGRETS.
AND TO ME BEING ABLE TO LEAVE

2298
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,862
THE JUNGLES OF FIJI AND BE FREE
AND LIVE THE LIFE THAT I WANTED

2299
01:46:21,896 --> 01:46:27,275
TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME MEANS
MORE TO ME THAN WINNING A

2300
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:29,448
MILLION DOLLARS.
SO I FEEL LIKE I'M LEAVING HERE

2301
01:46:29,482 --> 01:46:30,724
A WINNER.
Probst: ALL RIGHT, I HAVE A

2302
01:46:30,758 --> 01:46:34,103
LOT MORE TO TALK ABOUT.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK

2303
01:46:34,137 --> 01:46:36,517
BREAK, ANYBODY THAT NEEDS TO GET
A REFILL ON CHAMPAGNE, LET'S

2304
01:46:36,551 --> 01:46:40,344
LOAD IT UP.
WE'LL BRING IN MORE PIZZA AND

2305
01:46:40,379 --> 01:46:41,931
CONTINUE WITH THE SURVIVOR 42 AFTERSHOW.

2306
01:46:41,965 --> 01:46:47,103
MIKE, YOU'RE STARVING, ART YOU.
LET'S BRING IN A BUNCH OF PIES,

2307
01:46:47,137 --> 01:46:49,448
JUST FOR MIKE.
UP NEXT, PLAYERS RECOUNT SOME OF

2308
01:46:49,482 --> 01:46:51,172
THE BEST MOMENTS OF THE SEASON.

2309

PLUS LATER, YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
SURVIVOR 43.

2310
01:47:01,931 --> 01:47:05,103

2311
01:47:05,137 --> 01:47:08,896
PIZZAS ARE BEING DELIVERED,
CHAMPAGNE IS BEING DRUNK.

2312
01:47:08,931 --> 01:47:13,758
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME GAME MOMENTS.

2313
01:47:13,793 --> 01:47:16,551
LINDSAY, DREA AND HAI, STRAIGHT
OUT OF THE GATE, DOES EVERYBODY

2314
01:47:16,586 --> 01:47:20,241
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
OPENING CHALLENGE.

2315
01:47:20,275 --> 01:47:24,448
STOP, YOU MUST WAIT FOR ALL
THREE PLAYERS BEFORE YOU MAKE

2316
01:47:24,482 --> 01:47:26,413
THE DECISION.
GOOD NEWS IT REQUIRES EFFORT

2317
01:47:26,448 --> 01:47:28,655
FROM YOU.
IF YOU WANT YOU CAN GRAB YOUR

2318
01:47:28,689 --> 01:47:31,758
PADDLES AND RACE BACK TO YOUR
TRIBE OR YOU CAN AGREE TO

01:47:31,793 --> 01:47:36,241
SECRETLY WORK TOGETHER AND EACH
EARN AN ADVANTAGE IN THE

2320
01:47:36,275 --> 01:47:37,482
PROCESS.
Probst: LING SAI, IS THE

2321
01:47:37,517 --> 01:47:40,758
FASTEST THE THREE OF YOU DID
THAT A SIGN OF HOW YOU HAVE TO

2322
01:47:40,793 --> 01:47:43,103
PLAY SURVIVOR IN THAT IT WAS ONE
MINUTE INTO DAY ONE AND YOU HAD

2323
01:47:43,137 --> 01:47:45,413
ALREADY MADE YOUR DECISION TO GO
FOR IT.

2324
01:47:45,448 --> 01:47:49,689
YEAH, I MEAN THEY BOTH
PERSUADED ME INTO SAYING YES.

2325
01:47:49,724 --> 01:47:55,448
BECAUSE I KIND OF SAID NO.
AND THEN I READ IT AND I'M LIKE

2326
01:47:55,482 --> 01:47:56,689
WELL THIS IS DEFINITELY WORSE
THAN GOOD.

2327
01:47:56,724 --> 01:47:59,206
SO I HAVE TO HOPE THAT THEY
DON'T BELOW UP THEIR OWN GAME

2328
01:47:59,241 --> 01:48:02,241
AND BELOW UP MY GAME.
AND IT ENDED UP WORKING OUT

2329
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:05,034
GREAT.
WHERE NONE OF US WANTED TO GO

2330
01:48:05,068 --> 01:48:06,758
AFTER EACH OTHER.
WE ACTUALLY ALL WANTED TO WORK

2331
01:48:06,793 --> 01:48:09,379
TOGETHER.
AND IT WAS JUST LIKE WEIRD.

2332
01:48:09,413 --> 01:48:11,551
BUT AWESOME.
AND I THINK THAT JUST KIND OF

2333
01:48:11,586 --> 01:48:15,448
SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT ALL OF US.
I DON'T KNOW, THERE WAS A HUGE

2334
01:48:15,482 --> 01:48:19,448
RESPECT LEVEL THAT WAS DIFFERENT
THAN JUST SAVAGERY, SOLO GAME

2335
01:48:19,482 --> 01:48:20,827
PLAN.
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A BIG

2336
01:48:20,862 --> 01:48:25,551
TWIST THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING
WHEN I FIRST OPENED THAT

2337
01:48:25,586 --> 01:48:27,448
ADVANTAGE.
Probst: AND AGAIN I KEEP

2338
01:48:27,482 --> 01:48:31,379
FEELING LIKE I HAVE TO SAY THIS.
WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY OF SEASON

2339
01:48:31,413 --> 01:48:34,586
41 OURSELVES AS PRODUCERS.
WE ARE SHOOTING BACK TO BACK.

2340
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:37,586
I HAVE BEEN IN THE JUNGLE SO
LONG I HAVE A MULLETTE.

2341
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:42,482
NOBODY HAS SEEN ANYTHING BUT
THERE HAVE BEEN THEMES IN BOTH.

2342
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:45,586
AND ONE WAS FUN.
WE FELT LIKE COMING OUT OF THE

2343
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:47,724
YEAR WE HAD, WE WANTED TO HAVE FUN.

2344
01:48:47,758 --> 01:48:52,172
AND WITH THE BLOOD AND THE MUD,
YOU CAME BACK LOOKING LIKE YOU

2345
01:48:52,206 --> 01:48:55,206
HAD BEEN IN A WAR.
I WAS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO

2346
01:48:55,241 --> 01:49:00,655
COMMIT TO, THIS AND HAI WAS
LIKE-- AND OPEN YOUR-- HIGH,

2347
01:49:00,689 --> 01:49:02,965
PUTTING THE MUD OVER HIM,
ROLLING IN SAND.

2348
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,413
I THOUGHT IF WE ARE GOING TO
PLAY THIS GAME WE'RE GOING TO

2349
01:49:05,448 --> 01:49:08,206
GIVE IT ALL WE GOT.
AND OBVIOUSLY I'M GETTING THE

2350
01:49:08,241 --> 01:49:12,034
ADVANTAGE SO WE KIND OF-- .
Probst: DREA LET'S TALK

2351
01:49:12,068 --> 01:49:14,620
ABOUT ADVANTAGES.
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW, I DIDN'T

2352
01:49:14,655 --> 01:49:18,310
CHECK THE RECORDS BUT I'M NOT
SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD AS

2353
01:49:18,344 --> 01:49:21,310
MANY ADVANTAGES AT ONE TIME AS
YOU DID.

2354
01:49:21,344 --> 01:49:24,793
WALK ME THROUGH THE LIST OF WHAT
YOU HAD AT YOUR HEIGHT A AND

2355
01:49:24,827 --> 01:49:28,379
WHAT THAT FELT LIKE.
I HAD AN IDOL.

2356
01:49:28,413 --> 01:49:31,344
I HAD AN EXTRA VOTES.
I HAD MY SHOT IN THE DARK.

2357
01:49:31,379 --> 01:49:35,206
AND THEN I HAD MY KNOWLEDGE
TOWER ADVANTAGE AS WELL.

2358
01:49:35,241 --> 01:49:38,862
AND MY AM YOU LET.
SO I STRATEGICALLY PUT ALL MY

2359
01:49:38,896 --> 01:49:43,551
ADVANTAGES IN MY LEFT STOCK AND
TIED IT UP THREE TIMES AND PUT

2360
01:49:43,586 --> 01:49:48,172
THAT SOCK IN MY LEFT LEG OF MY
BLUE TIGHTS AND TIED THAT UP

2361
01:49:48,206 --> 01:49:49,586
FOUR TIMES.
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

2362
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:56,758
SO LIKE I KNEW IF SOMEONE WENT
THROUGH MY BAG.

2363
01:49:56,793 --> 01:49:58,896
Probst: GENERAL QUESTION IS
THERE ANYONE HERE THAT WILL

2364
01:49:58,931 --> 01:50:01,551
ADMIT WHEN THE FIRST FUNNY
PHRASE WAS SAID WHICH IS

2365
01:50:01,586 --> 01:50:03,827
MARYANNE TALKING ABOUT THE BUNNY
RABBIT IN THE MAIL BOX, THAT YOU

2366
01:50:03,862 --> 01:50:07,482
DIDN'T PICK UP ON IT.
YOU JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS-- OKAY,

2367
01:50:07,517 --> 01:50:12,103
IS THERE ANYONE WHO HEARD ALL
THREE PHRASES AND STILL DID NOT

2368
01:50:12,137 --> 01:50:13,517
KNOW.
GOOD.

2369
01:50:13,551 --> 01:50:15,551
I THINK I WASN'T PAYING
ATTENTION, JEFF, REALLY.

2370
01:50:15,586 --> 01:50:19,344
I THINK AFTER THE SECOND TIME
MARYANNE SAID THE PHRASE, I KIND

2371
01:50:19,379 --> 01:50:21,827
OF LIKE TUNED OUT.
I WAS LIKE OKAY, I'M FOCUSING ON

2372
01:50:21,862 --> 01:50:24,241
WHAT THE CHALLENGE IS GOES TO BE.

2373
01:50:24,275 --> 01:50:27,000
HAVE I TO DIVE OFF OF WHAT, HOW
HIGH UP.

2374
01:50:27,034 --> 01:50:29,517
I WAS NOT, I WAS NOT FOCUSED ANY MORE.

2375
01:50:29,551 --> 01:50:33,379
SO I GUESS RIGHT OVER MY HEAD.
Probst: DO OR DIE, LINDSAY,

2376
01:50:33,413 --> 01:50:37,206
ONE OF MY FAVORITE NEW TWISTS
BECAUSE IT IS LITERALLY DO OR

2377
01:50:37,241 --> 01:50:39,344
DIE.
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU KIND OF

2378
01:50:39,379 --> 01:50:41,517
ENJOYED IT EVEN THOUGH IT HAD TO
BE PETRI FYING.

2379
01:50:41,551 --> 01:50:47,068
YEAH, I MEAN IT WAS AWESOME.
LIKE IT WAS REALLY COOL.

2380
01:50:47,103 --> 01:50:50,724
AND SAYING THE COOLEST PART
ABOUT T THE ADRENALINE RUSH AND

2381
01:50:50,758 --> 01:50:53,931
EXCITEMENT AND THRILL AND WORRY
AND THAT FEAR WAS REALLY COOL.

2382
01:50:53,965 --> 01:50:57,034
Probst: AND WOULD YOU HAVE
BEEN OKAY IF YOU HAD DIED.

2383
01:50:57,068 --> 01:51:00,344
WITH THE TWIST, YES.
THE GAMBLE THAT I MADE, NO.

2384
01:51:00,379 --> 01:51:04,758
SO I STILL WAS VERY REGRETFUL OF
MAKING THAT GAMBLE DECISION.

2385
01:51:04,793 --> 01:51:08,482
BUT THE DO OR DIE ITSELF IS A
COOL TWIST THAT YOU HAVE TO

2386
01:51:08,517 --> 01:51:12,344
ACCEPT, IF YOU DON'T PICK THE
RIGHT BOX LIKE BEING OKAY WITH

2387
01:51:12,379 --> 01:51:14,793
IT, THAT IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE
REGRETTED, NOT NECESSARILY JUST

2388
01:51:14,827 --> 01:51:17,551
THE DO OR DIE CHANCE THING.
Probst: I ALSO HAVE TO

2389
01:51:17,586 --> 01:51:21,137
POINT OUT, YOU WERE LODGELY
SLATED TO BE IN SURVIVOR 41.

2390
01:51:21,172 --> 01:51:25,620
YOU TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID,
COULD NOT COME OUT.

2391
01:51:25,655 --> 01:51:28,344
AND I REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED ON
THE SHOWN AND I WAS SO SAD FOR

2392
01:51:28,379 --> 01:51:32,310
YOU, AND I HUNG UP AND I SAID
WOW, HER ATTITUDE IS AMAZING

2393
01:51:32,344 --> 01:51:34,068
BECAUSE YOU SAID HEY, YOU KNOW T
WILL HAPPEN.

2394
01:51:34,103 --> 01:51:37,482
SORRY, YOU EVEN SAID ON THE
PHONE WHEN I WAS LIKE YOU NEVER

2395
01:51:37,517 --> 01:51:40,655
KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT SEASON

2396
01:51:40,689 --> 01:51:44,793
43, RIGHT, AND I WAS LIKE NO,
I'M TALKING ABOUT SEASON 42.

2397
01:51:44,827 --> 01:51:47,758
IF IT HAPPENS TO SOMEBODY ELSE,
I MIGHT BE ON 42.

2398
01:51:47,793 --> 01:51:52,310
AND I HUNG UP AND I WENT
SHE'S PRETTY OPTIMISTIC.

2399
01:51:52,344 --> 01:51:54,482
Probst: ALL RIGHT, WE WILL

2400
01:51:54,517 --> 01:51:59,793
TAKE ANOTHER QUICK BREAK, WHEN
WE COME BACK MORE FROM FIJI, THE

2401
01:51:59,827 --> 01:52:05,586
SURVIVOR SEASON 42 AFTER SHOW.
MIKE, MORE PIZZA.

2402
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:06,827
YEAH.
Probst: UP NEXT, PLAYERS

2403
01:52:06,862 --> 01:52:08,137
SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE NEW
ERA OF SURVIVOR AND HOW

2404
01:52:08,172 --> 01:52:10,896
DIFFICULT IT IS TO MANAGE
EMOTIONS IN THE GAME.

2405
01:52:21,137 --> 01:52:23,862
Probst: I LOVE ARE YOU
HAVING SO MUCH PIZZA SO MUCH

2406
01:52:23,896 --> 01:52:26,275
CHAMPAGNE, LET'S JUST KEEP TALKING.

2407
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:30,206
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE
NEW ERA OF SURVIVOR WHICH IS THE

2408
01:52:30,241 --> 01:52:35,551
26 DAY NO RICE, VERY TOUGH, YOU
EARN EVERYTHING, CRAZY TWISTS,

2409
01:52:35,586 --> 01:52:37,586
MORE DANGEROUS GAME.
CHANELLE, LET'S START WITH YOU.

2410
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:41,689
HOW BIG AN IMPACT IS THE NO
RICE?

2411
01:52:41,724 --> 01:52:46,931
MAN, I MEAN IF SOMEONE TOLD
ME THAT I WOULDN'T EAT FOR 11

2412
01:52:46,965 --> 01:52:49,551
DAYS, I WOULD BE LIKE YOU'RE
CRAZY, THE WAY THAT YOU

2413
01:52:49,586 --> 01:52:51,689
PHYSICALLY FEEL.
I REMEMBER STANDING UP AND JUST

2414
01:52:51,724 --> 01:52:55,517
BEING DIZZY AND SEEING STARS AND
NOT BEING ABLE TO WALK MORE THAN

2415
01:52:55,551 --> 01:52:57,206
THREE STEPS WITHOUT BEING WINDED.

2416
01:52:57,241 --> 01:53:00,827
AND SO IT REALLY IMPACTS YOUR
BODY AND IT MAKES THE GAME THAT

2417
01:53:00,862 --> 01:53:02,413
MUCH HARDER.
Probst: JONATHAN, ANOTHER

2418
01:53:02,448 --> 01:53:06,931
PART OF THIS GAME THAT WE DIDN'T
TALK ABOUT BUT BECAME VERY

2419
01:53:06,965 --> 01:53:09,724
EVIDENT AS YOU WERE PLAYING IT,
IT IS RARE AT TRIBAL THAT THERE

2420
01:53:09,758 --> 01:53:12,689
ARE MORE THAN SIX OR SEVEN PEOPLE.

2421
01:53:12,724 --> 01:53:13,931
WE BROKE YOU UP INTO DIFFERENT GROUPS.

2422
01:53:13,965 --> 01:53:16,862
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THAT.
WHEN YOU START WITH A SMALL

2423
01:53:16,896 --> 01:53:19,965
TRIBE AND YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYWHERE TO HIDE AT TRIBAL.

2424
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,793
WELL, BEING A BIGGER GUY, I
ALREADY FELT LIKE COMING INTO

2425
01:53:23,827 --> 01:53:26,413
THIS THAT I COULDN'T HIDE ANYWAYS.

2426
01:53:26,448 --> 01:53:29,241
AND NOW THAT WE HAVE SMALL
TRIBES, I WAS THINKING WELL NOW

2427
01:53:29,275 --> 01:53:30,551
THERE'S DEFINITELY NO PLACE TO HIDE.

2428
01:53:30,586 --> 01:53:35,275
AND THE ODDS OF ME GETTING
KICKED OUT ARE MORE THAN EVER.

2429
01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:38,137
AND THAT WORRIED ME, MR. JEFF,
THAT I COULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST

2430
01:53:38,172 --> 01:53:42,034
TO GET KICKED OFF.
AND IT SCARED ME TO DEATH.

2431
01:53:42,068 --> 01:53:45,724
Probst: AND OMAR, ON TOP OF
IT, NOT EVERYBODY KNEW EARLY ON

2432
01:53:45,758 --> 01:53:48,000
THAT WHEN YOU TOOK THESE
JOURNEYS YOU HAD OPPORTUNITIES

2433
01:53:48,034 --> 01:53:49,689
TO GET SOMETHING.
BUT IT REQUIRED YOU TO RISK

2434
01:53:49,724 --> 01:53:52,931
LOSING YOUR VOTE.
YEAH, AND ON TOP OF THAT THE

2435
01:53:52,965 --> 01:53:54,379
SHOT IN THE DARK MIGHT TAKE
VOTES AWAY.

2436
01:53:54,413 --> 01:53:57,344
SO YOU ARE IN A SITUATION,
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE NUMBERS ARE

2437
01:53:57,379 --> 01:54:00,862
SO SMALL WHERE YOU MAY THINK
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING AND

2438
01:54:00,896 --> 01:54:04,310
SOMETHING COMPLETELY, A SECOND,
THIRD OR EVEN FOURTH TARGET

2439
01:54:04,344 --> 01:54:07,448
COULD GO HOME THAT WAS NEVER
SUPPOSED TO GO HOME IN THE FIRST

2440
01:54:07,482 --> 01:54:08,931
PLACE.
YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS BE THINKING

2441
01:54:08,965 --> 01:54:11,275
AND ANTICIPATING WHAT OTHER
PEOPLE ARE DOING MORE THAN EVER

2442
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:13,620
BEFORE.
MIKE, EVEN THE BEWARE

2443
01:54:13,655 --> 01:54:15,241
ADVANTAGES, THEY SAY VERY
CLEARLY BEWARE.

2444
01:54:15,275 --> 01:54:19,586
DO YOU GET EXCITED WITH THOSE
KINDS OF CHANGES WHERE IT IS

2445
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:21,103
RISKIER.
THIS GAME IS MORE DIFFICULT NOW

2446
01:54:21,137 --> 01:54:24,344
THAN IT WAS?
IT IS EXTREMELY RISKY.

2447
01:54:24,379 --> 01:54:29,655
WHEN I FOUND MY IDOL I SAID
BEWARE, IMMEDIATELY I GRABBED T

2448
01:54:29,689 --> 01:54:33,586
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE BEWARE IS,
THE THRILL OF EVEN FINDING IT

2449
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:36,724
BUT THEN WHEN YOU OPEN IT UP
REALITY HITS AND YOU SAY OH

2450
01:54:36,758 --> 01:54:39,655
CRAP, I DON'T WANT THIS.
ST ALMOST LIKE WHOA, GET BACK.

2451
01:54:39,689 --> 01:54:43,482
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
DID AND SAY LIKE IF YOU HAVE AN

2452
01:54:43,517 --> 01:54:46,413
ADVANTAGE THAT TELLS YOU YOU
LOSE YOUR VOTE, YOU KIND OF HAVE

2453
01:54:46,448 --> 01:54:49,724
TO TELL SOMEBODY.
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO SPLIT

2454
01:54:49,758 --> 01:54:51,965
VOTES OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW YOU
ARE GOING TO BE EXPOSED ANYWAY.

2455
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,793
WHICH HAPPENED AT OUR VOTES.
YOU HAVE ANOTHER SURVIVOR

2456
01:54:55,827 --> 01:54:58,379
FIRST, THERE WERE ONLY TWO VOTES
CAST WHICH MEANS TWO PEOPLE DID

2457
01:54:58,413 --> 01:55:02,310
NOT VOTE.
DIDN'T ANTICIPATE HAVING TO

2458
01:55:02,344 --> 01:55:05,586
REVEAL WHO YOU ARE, BUT NOW
BECAUSE OF A TIE AND THE

2459
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:08,310
INABILITY TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT,
YOU HAVE TO.

2460
01:55:08,344 --> 01:55:16,000
SO WHO DIDN'T VOTE.
WE WILL TO RAISE OUR HAND LIKE

2461
01:55:16,034 --> 01:55:18,482
THIS, LIKE WE GOT CAUGHT, WE
DON'T HAVE OUR VOTE.

2462
01:55:18,517 --> 01:55:21,241
Probst: HOW ABOUT YOU
LINDSAY, OVERALL APPROACH TO THE

2463
01:55:21,275 --> 01:55:24,896
GAINL, OF SURVIVOR, DID IT FEEL
RISKIER OR MORE DANGEROUS,

2464
01:55:24,931 --> 01:55:29,413
BECAUSE YOU COME IN BLIND, YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN STORE FOR

2465
01:55:29,448 --> 01:55:31,758
YOU, BUT WE HAD CONSCIENCELY
DECIDED WITH 41 AND 42 TO MAKE

2466
01:55:31,793 --> 01:55:36,448
IT MORE FUN AND MORE DANGEROUS
AND SEE WHERE IT TAKES US.

2467
01:55:36,482 --> 01:55:41,137
I ACTUALLY LOVED IT.
AT THE BEGINNING IT WAS KIND OF

2468
01:55:41,172 --> 01:55:44,275
DIFFICULT, LIKE WHEN YOU ARE
REALLY LIVING IT AND ALL THESE

2469
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:48,793
THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND YOU
LIKE THIS SUK SUCKS, THIS SUCKS,

2470
01:55:48,827 --> 01:55:51,206
THIS SUCKS ALL HARD DIFFICULT
THINGS BECAUSE WE ALL WATCHED

2471
01:55:51,241 --> 01:55:54,482
ALL OF THE SEASONS SO AT THIS
POINT THINGS ARE MORE

2472
01:55:54,517 --> 01:55:55,758
PREDICTABLE.
WE ARE ALREADY LIKE MENTALLY

2473
01:55:55,793 --> 01:55:58,379
PLANNING WHAT THE THINGS ARE
GOING TO BE NEXT AND WITH ALL OF

2474
01:55:58,413 --> 01:56:01,310
THESE TWISTS YOU ARE LIKE I
DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS GOING TO

2475
01:56:01,344 --> 01:56:03,827
HAPPEN.
BUT THEN I WAS LIKE HALFWAY

2476
01:56:03,862 --> 01:56:05,689
THROUGH, THIS IS PRETTY AWESOME
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL KIND OF

2477
01:56:05,724 --> 01:56:08,310
EXPERIENCING A WHOLE NEW GAME
THAT NO ONE IS AWARE OF RATHER

2478
01:56:08,344 --> 01:56:12,379
THAN PLAYING A GAME THAT EVERY
ONE KNOWS EVERYONE'S MOVE AND

2479
01:56:12,413 --> 01:56:14,310
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
I WAS LIKE THIS IS PRETTY COOL.

2480
01:56:14,344 --> 01:56:19,551
IT'S LIKE ARE YOU IN A GAME OF
JUMANJI BECAUSE ARE YOU LIVE,

2481
01:56:19,586 --> 01:56:21,379
BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE
TWISTS ARE.

2482
01:56:21,413 --> 01:56:25,413
BUT IT IS COOL TO TAKE THE RIDE,
I LOVED IT.

2483
01:56:25,448 --> 01:56:29,689
Probst: LET'S TALK ABOUT
MANAGING EMOTIONS IN THE GAME.

2484
01:56:29,724 --> 01:56:31,655
MARYANNE.
I WASN'T COMING TO YOU BECAUSE

2485
01:56:31,689 --> 01:56:33,793
YOU ARE EMOTIONAL.
BASE YOUR EMOTIONS ARE ACTUALLY,

2486
01:56:33,827 --> 01:56:37,517
TO ME WERE ALWAYS JUST REALLY
FUN AND OPENING.

2487
01:56:37,551 --> 01:56:40,655
YOU WERE VERY ACCEPTABLE.
BUT LET'S START WITH YOU.

2488
01:56:40,689 --> 01:56:42,448
HOW DO YOU FEEL WITH THE
EMOTIONS?

2489
01:56:42,482 --> 01:56:45,379
WHAT DID YOU LEARN ABOUT
YOURSELF AND YOUR ABILITY IN THE

2490
01:56:45,413 --> 01:56:50,103
MOMENTS TO MANAGE YOUR EMOTIONS.
I FEEL THAT IT IS A REALLY

2491
01:56:50,137 --> 01:56:52,137
BIG THING WHICH I LEARNED,
ESPECIALLY THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF

2492
01:56:52,172 --> 01:56:55,793
SURVIVOR THAT YOU NEED TO
VALIDATE YOUR FEELINGS, YOU

2493
01:56:55,827 --> 01:56:57,689
KNOW.
A LOT OF TIMES WHEN IT IS

2494
01:56:57,724 --> 01:57:00,758
RAINING AND YOU FEEL MISERABLE
YOU ARE LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE WANT

2495
01:57:00,793 --> 01:57:03,137
TO DO THIS AND I FEEL BAD THAT
I'M FEELS BAD.

2496
01:57:03,172 --> 01:57:06,000
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, ST OKAY THAT
I'M FEELS BAD.

2497
01:57:06,034 --> 01:57:07,931
THIS IS A PART OF THE EXPERIENCE.

2498
01:57:07,965 --> 01:57:10,448
I'M GOING TO MOVE.
LIKE I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO

2499
01:57:10,482 --> 01:57:13,034
TO THE NEXT THING LIKE I
SURVIVED THIS.

2500
01:57:13,068 --> 01:57:14,310
BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T WANT TO
SIR VIVE THIS.

2501
01:57:14,344 --> 01:57:17,448
I WANT TO BE HOME AND WARM AND I
DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

2502
01:57:17,482 --> 01:57:21,586
AND THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE WE ALL
HAVE OUR LOWS AND OUR HIGHS.

2503
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:25,034
TORI, I REMEMBER A FEW TIMES
AT TRIBAL WONDERING WHAT YOU

2504
01:57:25,068 --> 01:57:26,482
WERE DOING BECAUSE YOU WOULD
TAKE HEAT, AND SO YOUR CREDIT

2505
01:57:26,517 --> 01:57:31,379
YOU WOULD TURN AND PUSHBACK.
DID YOU EVER GO BACK TO CAMP AND

2506
01:57:31,413 --> 01:57:36,000
HAVE YOUR OWN INTERNAL MONOLOGUE
ABOUT HOW YOU WERE FEELING

2507
01:57:36,034 --> 01:57:38,310
ABSOLUTELY.
I TRIED MORE-- CRIED MORE THAN I

2508
01:57:38,344 --> 01:57:41,827
THOUGHT I WOULD, AND IT IS FUNNY
BECAUSE MY FAMILY, HAVE I SO

2509
01:57:41,862 --> 01:57:44,241
MANY FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY
SAID THEIR BIGGEST WORRY OF ME

2510
01:57:44,275 --> 01:57:45,793
COMING OUT OF HERE IS THAT I
WOULD BE TOO EMOTIONAL.

2511
01:57:45,827 --> 01:57:52,034
I SAID NO, IT SAY GAME, ALL
COMPARTMENTALIZED, NO, DAY

2512
01:57:52,068 --> 01:57:55,551
THREE, I WAS CRYING SO MUCH TO
MYSELF AND PEOPLE IN THE TRIBE.

2513
01:57:55,586 --> 01:57:57,551
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS
GOES TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU ARE

2514
01:57:57,586 --> 01:57:59,137
HERE.
I RECOGNIZED THAT MY EMOTIONS

2515
01:57:59,862 --> 01:58:03,517
ARE MY GREATEST STRENGTH, AS A
THERAPIST I HAVE TO BE

2516
01:58:03,551 --> 01:58:07,275
EMPATHETIC AND EMOTIONAL BUT CAN
ALSO BE MY GREATEST WEAKNESS.

2517
01:58:07,310 --> 01:58:09,689
SO WHAT MAKES YOU GOOD ALSO
MAKES YOU BAD.

2518
01:58:09,724 --> 01:58:12,137
SO I REALLY LEARNED MORE ABOUT
THAT COMING OUT HERE FOR SURE.

2519
01:58:12,172 --> 01:58:15,793
I'M CURIOUS, HOW MANY PEOPLE,
BIG SHOT, HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL

2520
01:58:15,827 --> 01:58:19,620
ADMIT THAT THEY HAD A MOMENT
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST IN PRIVATE

2521
01:58:19,655 --> 01:58:24,965
WHETHER THERE WERE TEARS OR NOT,
IT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF AN

2522
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,448
EMOTIONAL CRY. WOW.

2523
01:58:27,482 --> 01:58:30,655
EVERY PERSON.
SO NOBODY CAN GET AWAY INTEREST

2524
01:58:30,689 --> 01:58:33,689
THAT.
OMAR, WHY IS THAT?

2525
01:58:33,724 --> 01:58:37,689
WHAT IS IT THAT HAPPENS THAT
BRINGS YOU TO THAT POINT?

2526
01:58:37,724 --> 01:58:41,620
I MEAN I ALMOST NEVER CRY IN
REAL LIFE SO THE FACT THAT I

2527
01:58:41,655 --> 01:58:44,482
CRIED SO MANY TIMES OUT HERE IS
OUTRAGEOUS, BUT I THINK IT

2528
01:58:44,517 --> 01:58:47,793
REALLY IS BECAUSE YOU ARE
STRIPPED TO THE CORE OF WHO YOU

2529
01:58:47,827 --> 01:58:49,000
ARE.
YOU HAVE NO COMFORT THAT WOULD

2530
01:58:49,034 --> 01:58:50,793
YOU NORMALLY HAVE IN REAL LIFE
AND YOUR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT

2531
01:58:50,827 --> 01:58:54,655
SYSTEM IS ABSENT AND YOU HAVE
NOTHING BUT TIME TO THINK.

2532
01:58:54,689 --> 01:58:57,655
AND YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES PAINFUL
MEMORIES FROM YOUR PAST COME

2533
01:58:57,689 --> 01:58:59,310
BACK.
AND YOU ARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT

2534
01:58:59,344 --> 01:59:01,655
WHERE YOU CAN EMBRACE THAT.
AND LET IT OUT.

2535
01:59:01,689 --> 01:59:04,482
AND SOMETIMES IT IS
GAME-RELATED.

2536
01:59:04,517 --> 01:59:06,344
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT.
BUT ARE YOU SO STRIPPED OF

2537
01:59:06,379 --> 01:59:09,103
EVERYTHING THAT EMOTIONS JUST
COMES OUT.

2538
01:59:09,137 --> 01:59:13,862
AND I CRIED MORE HERE THAN HAVE
I IN THE LAST TWO YEARS,

2539
01:59:13,896 --> 01:59:14,896
PROBABLY.
Probst: DREA HOW ABOUT FOR

2540
01:59:14,931 --> 01:59:16,896
YOU.
BEFORE YOU ANSWER, THIS IS MY

2541
01:59:16,931 --> 01:59:19,551
TAKE ON YOU.
AND REMEMBER I'M NOT ON THE

2542
01:59:19,586 --> 01:59:22,310
BEACHES WITH YOU.
BY DESIGN MY JOB IS TO JUST

2543
01:59:22,344 --> 01:59:24,758
OBSERVE THE THINGS I GET TO SEE
AND SEE WHAT I CAN LIRN.

2544
01:59:24,793 --> 01:59:27,068
AND NOT REALLY KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT IS GOING ON.

2545
01:59:27,103 --> 01:59:31,827
BUT YOU ALWAYS STRIKE ME AS A
LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS, BUT INSIDE

2546
01:59:31,862 --> 01:59:35,827
I THINK YOUR HEART IS LIKE THIS.
DID YOU HAVE YOUR MOMENTS.

2547
01:59:35,862 --> 01:59:39,689
YES, THAT'S ME.
AND I HAD PLENTY OF MOMENTS HERE

2548
01:59:39,724 --> 01:59:42,862
ON THIS ISLAND.
I CRIED AT NIGHT, JUST BY

2549
01:59:42,896 --> 01:59:45,689
MYSELF, WHEN PEOPLE WEREN'T HERE
I WAS STARVING.

2550
01:59:45,724 --> 01:59:49,137
I BARELY SLEPT.
IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL FOR ME.

2551
01:59:49,172 --> 01:59:55,172
THIS WAS VERY HARD FOR ME, YEAH.
Probst: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE

2552
01:59:55,206 --> 01:59:59,068
ANOTHER QUICK BREAK, WHEN WE
COME BACK THOUGH I'M GOING TO

2553
01:59:59,103 --> 02:00:02,793
ASK OMAR SOME ANIMALS THAT HE
THINK DESCRIBES THE FINAL THREE.

2554
02:00:02,827 --> 02:00:07,344
BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE SURVIVOR.
COME ON IN WITH MORE CHAMPAGNE,

2555
02:00:07,379 --> 02:00:11,000
IT'S SURVIVOR 42 AFTERSHOW. UP
NEXT, WE CHECK BACK IN WITH OUR

2556
02:00:11,034 --> 02:00:14,965
FINAL THREE AND YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT SURVIVOR 43.

2557
02:00:24,965 --> 02:00:27,620
Probst: WELCOME BACK TO THE
SURVIVOR 42 AFTERSHOW.

2558
02:00:27,655 --> 02:00:30,965
I SHOULD CLEAR UP, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE HAVE A GIANT CATERING TEAM,

2559
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,137
WHAT IS COOL ABOUT OUR TEAM IS
HALF THE PEOPLE DOING THIS RIGHT

2560
02:00:33,172 --> 02:00:36,517
NOW ARE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT
WERE OUT THERE ON THE BEACH WITH

2561
02:00:36,551 --> 02:00:39,586
ME.
THEY ARE OUR SHOOTERS, OUR AC'S,

2562
02:00:39,620 --> 02:00:42,517
OUR AUDIO TEAM, SURVIVOR IS THIS
BIG FAMILY WHICH IS WHY FOR ME

2563
02:00:42,551 --> 02:00:46,931
THIS IS THE MOST REAL REACTIONS
WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET.

2564
02:00:46,965 --> 02:00:50,655
SO AHMAR, LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.
YOU LOVE ANIMALS, LET'S NAME

2565
02:00:50,689 --> 02:00:56,413
SOME ANIMALS THAT DESCRIBE
MARYANNE, ROMEO AND MIKE.

2566
02:00:56,448 --> 02:01:00,758
OKAY.
SO MARYANNE IS DEFINITELY THE

2567
02:01:00,793 --> 02:01:06,034
AMAZON PARROT.
GOOGLE OF SIPGING, LAUGHING

2568
02:01:06,068 --> 02:01:08,586
IMMIGRATE-- IMITATING VOICES AND
SO CHEERY ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT

2569
02:01:08,620 --> 02:01:10,758
UNDERNEATH THAT THEY HAVE THE
INTELLIGENCE OF A TODDLER.

2570
02:01:10,793 --> 02:01:14,758
AND I DON'T MEAN THAT AS AN
INSULT TO YOU BUT FOR A BIRD FLA

2571
02:01:14,793 --> 02:01:17,379
IS PRETTY GOOD.
THEY ARE VERY INTELLIGENT

2572
02:01:17,413 --> 02:01:20,586
ANIMALS BUT THEY HAVE THAT FUN
AND GOOFY SIDE THAT ALWAYS KEEPS

2573
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:24,551
YOU LAUGHING.
ROMEO IN THE GAME CUZ I DON'T

2574
02:01:24,586 --> 02:01:28,448
KNOW HIM OUTSIDE OF THE GAME
REMINDED ME OF A FLEDGE LING

2575
02:01:28,482 --> 02:01:32,137
BIRD LEAVING THE NEST BUT THEN
FALLS AND BREAKS ITS WINGS.

2576
02:01:32,172 --> 02:01:35,275
AND THEN I GOT TO TAKE IT IN AND
TRY TO HEAL IT AND WATCH HIM

2577
02:01:35,310 --> 02:01:38,655
GROW AND HE MATURED IN TO A FINALIST.

2578
02:01:38,689 --> 02:01:43,724
SO YOU KNOW, HE IS THE LITTLE
ROBIN THAT COULD.

2579
02:01:43,758 --> 02:01:51,310
MIKE, I DOBILITY KNOW, MAN-- .
Probst: JOB THAN, GIVE THE

2580
02:01:51,344 --> 02:01:54,758
MAN A MOMENT.

2581
02:01:54,793 --> 02:02:02,620
I FEEL LIKE MIKE IS LIKE-- OH
MY GOSH, LIKE A KOALA BEAR.

2582
02:02:02,655 --> 02:02:07,482
LIKE STRONG, SOLID, EATS THE
SAME THING EVERY DAY, A LITTLE

2583
02:02:07,517 --> 02:02:09,965
BIT CUDDLY BUT HE HAS A LITTLE
BIT OF THOSE CLAWS THAT YOU

2584
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:13,724
DON'T SEE COMING UNTIL HE BLIND
SIDES YOU.

2585
02:02:13,758 --> 02:02:17,724
BUT ULTIMATELY HE HAS GOT A GOOD
HEART AND HE IS JUST A CUDDLY

2586
02:02:17,758 --> 02:02:20,586
BIG TEDDY BEAR.
Probst: ALL RIGHT, FOR THE

2587
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:24,551
LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES HERE, I
JUST WANT TO CHECK BACK IN WITH

2588
02:02:24,586 --> 02:02:27,034
OUR FINAL THREE.
BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH SO

2589
02:02:27,068 --> 02:02:29,620
MUCH.
YOU LITERALLY JUST FINISHED 26

2590
02:02:29,655 --> 02:02:32,586
OF THE MOST INTENSE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE.

2591
02:02:32,620 --> 02:02:35,793
THEN YOU FACED YOUR JURY AND
THEY GRILLED YOU.

2592
02:02:35,827 --> 02:02:38,586
AND NOW WE HAVE A WINNER.
SO THERE IS NO DOUBT YOU ARE

2593
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:41,482
GOING HOME KNOWING, YOU ARE
GOING TO GO HOME TRYING TO KEEP

2594
02:02:41,517 --> 02:02:44,551
A SECRET, HOPEFULLY.
SO ROMEO, WHAT IS THE FEELING

2595
02:02:44,586 --> 02:02:48,689
YOU HAVE A LITTLE FOOD IN YOUR
STOMACH, 96 INSTEAD OF -9D 5.

2596
02:02:48,724 --> 02:02:51,965
WHAT IS YOUR FEELING, ARE YOU
PROUD OF YOURSELF?

2597
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,620
YES, I'M VERY PROUD OF MYSELF.

2598
02:02:53,655 --> 02:02:56,689
BECAUSE LIKE I SAID BEFORE I
CAME HERE FOR THE EXPERIENCE.

2599
02:02:56,724 --> 02:03:01,206
AND I GOT THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE.
I WENT AS FAR AS ANYONE CAN GO

2600
02:03:01,241 --> 02:03:04,310
IN THIS GAME.
AND I HAVE NO HARD FEELINGS.

2601
02:03:04,344 --> 02:03:06,931
IT IS A GAME.
I STILL LOVE THESE PEOPLE AND I

2602
02:03:06,965 --> 02:03:11,655
STILL WANT TO HANG OUT WITH THEM
AND I FEEL LIKE I GREW OUT HERE

2603
02:03:11,689 --> 02:03:13,241
AND OMAR'S REFERENCE, YES, I
WILL TAKE THAT.

2604
02:03:13,275 --> 02:03:18,310
YOU KNOW, I WAS VERY SCARED,
VERY PARANOID, AND IN THE END I

2605
02:03:18,344 --> 02:03:23,275
WON THAT FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE AND I THOUGHT I WON.

2606
02:03:23,310 --> 02:03:27,000
IN THE GAME OF LIFE I FEEL LIKE
I WON CONDITIONS CAN'T DID FOR

2607
02:03:27,034 --> 02:03:30,000
MORE THAN THAT, RIGHT?
NO.

2608
02:03:30,034 --> 02:03:31,172
HOW ABOUT YOU, HERE IS WHAT
MI WONDERING.

2609
02:03:31,206 --> 02:03:34,827
YOU GOT VERY QUIET.
I DON'T KNOW T COWS J BE THE

PIZZA ARE YOU PUTTING DOWN.
BUT ARE YOU GOOD WITH THIS?

2611
02:03:39,379 --> 02:03:41,655
I'M EXTREMELY GOOD WITH IT.
GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN WITH

2612
02:03:41,689 --> 02:03:45,241
THAT MONEY.
QUITE FRANKLY, NOT THAT I DON'T

2613
02:03:45,275 --> 02:03:47,551
WANT THAT MONEY BUT I DON'T
REALLY NEED THE MONEY.

2614
02:03:47,586 --> 02:03:48,655
AS I TOLD EVERYBODY, I'M HAPPY
IN LIFE.

2615
02:03:48,689 --> 02:03:51,827
I HAVE MY FEE AN SAIRKS I HAVE
MY KIDS.

2616
02:03:51,862 --> 02:03:55,448
I'M ALREADY RICH.
SHE'S A YOUNG GIRL SETTING OUT.

2617
02:03:55,482 --> 02:03:59,310
AND I KNOW GOOD THINGS ARE GOING
TO HAPPEN WITH THAT MONEY, SO I

2618
02:03:59,344 --> 02:04:01,241
AM EXTREMELY FIEFN WITH EVERYTHING.

2619
02:04:01,275 --> 02:04:04,034
AND HONESTLY, I REALLY LIKE
EVERYBODY IN THIS TENT, THERE IS

2620
02:04:04,068 --> 02:04:07,655
NOT A MEAN PERSON HERE.
Probst: WHICH BRINGS US TO

I REMEMBER MEETING YOU.

2622

I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME WE
SPOKE AND I REMEMBER THINKS

2623
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:15,896
SHE'S GOT TO BE ON THE SHOW, SHE
IS JUST TOO FUN, TOO ENERGETIC,

2624
02:04:15,931 --> 02:04:19,965
HER SMILE IS TOO AMAZING.
WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU OR

2625
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,862
DIDN'T EXPECT ABOUT YOU IS HOW
GOOD YOU WOULD BE.

2626
02:04:21,896 --> 02:04:24,310
I THINK YOU WERE REALLY GOOD AT
THIS GAME.

2627
02:04:24,344 --> 02:04:25,965
I THINK YOU WORKED PEOPLE AT THE
RIGHT TIME.

2628
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,965
I THINK YOU USED YOUR CHARM
MAYBE MORE THAN YOU ARE SAYING.

2629
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,241
I THINK YOU WERE A VERY
IMPRESSIVE WINNER AND AS YOU SIT

2630
02:04:31,275 --> 02:04:35,827
HERE NOW, KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE
A MILLION DOLLARS, YOU ARE THE

2631
02:04:35,862 --> 02:04:39,103
WINNER OF SURVIVOR 42, AS YOU
SAID, ONE OF ONLY 40 WINNERS FOR

2632
02:04:39,137 --> 02:04:41,793
A SHOW THAT HAS BEEN ON 21 YEARS.

2633
02:04:41,827 --> 02:04:45,862
OH MY GOD.
Probst: HOW DO YOU FEEL

2634
02:04:45,896 --> 02:04:48,206
RIGHT NOW?
CLOSE THIS OUT?

2635
02:04:48,241 --> 02:04:49,724
IT STILL FEELS LIKE THIS
ISN'T HAPPENING.

2636
02:04:49,758 --> 02:04:53,206
LIKE I FEEL AS IF I ALWAYS KNEW
THAT I WAS GOING TO GO ON TIS

2637
02:04:53,241 --> 02:04:55,448
SHOW.
BUT I REMEMBER LIKE GOING AND

2638
02:04:55,482 --> 02:04:57,827
LITERALLY LEAVING AND WRITING
NIE BUCKET LIST AND HAVING MY

2639
02:04:57,862 --> 02:05:01,620
SISTER LOOK AT IT AND SAY WHY
ISN'T WINNING ON THIS BUCKET

2640
02:05:01,655 --> 02:05:02,793
LIST.
AND I TRULY DIDN'T THINK I WAS

2641
02:05:02,827 --> 02:05:04,448
GOING TO WIN.
SHE IS LIKE YOU ARE GOING INTO

2642
02:05:04,482 --> 02:05:08,034
THIS GAME THINKING YOU CAN'T
WIN, YEAH, LIKE I WAS ALREADY

2643
02:05:08,068 --> 02:05:11,965
THINK BEING THE JURY, AND WHICH
I WITH WEAR TO THIS ONE AND THIS

2644
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,034
ONE.
BECAUSE UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE I

2645
02:05:14,068 --> 02:05:16,551
CAME OUT HERE, I DIDN'T THINK I
HAD THE ABILITY TO WIN.

2646
02:05:16,586 --> 02:05:20,620
AND IT IS LIKE, TO COME OUT HERE
AND THEN TO PLAY A GAME THEN

2647
02:05:20,655 --> 02:05:25,931
AFTER TO PLAY CLEARLY ONE OF THE
SLOPPY GAME ACCORDING TO THE

2648
02:05:25,965 --> 02:05:28,655
JURY MEMBERS WHICH IS FINE BUT
THEN TO STILL PULL IT OUT AND BE

2649
02:05:28,689 --> 02:05:32,620
ABLE TO WIN T IS LIKE WHEN I
TOLD YOU HOW I FEEL LIKE I'M

2650
02:05:32,655 --> 02:05:34,241
DREESMING, IT FEELS LIKE I'M
DREAMING RIGHT NOW.

2651
02:05:34,275 --> 02:05:35,793
Probst: I'M REALLY PROUD
THAT YOU WON.

2652
02:05:35,827 --> 02:05:40,586
YOU ARE A GREAT WINNER.
I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO

2653
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:41,896
REPRESENT SURVIVOR WELL.
YES, YOU ARE.

2654
02:05:41,931 --> 02:05:44,068
OH MY GOSH.
Probst: I'M SO HAPPY THAT

2655
02:05:44,103 --> 02:05:46,758
YOU DID WHAT YOU DID TO GET OUT HERE.

2656
02:05:46,793 --> 02:05:48,758
BECAUSE I KNOW IT TOOK A LOT FOR
US TO GET HERE.

2657
02:05:48,793 --> 02:05:52,517
I KNOW IT TOOK A LOT FOR YOU TO
GET HERE AND YOUR FAMILY, YOUR

2658
02:05:52,551 --> 02:05:54,793
FRIENDS, WHOEVER SUPPORTED YOU
TO GET OUT HERE.

2659
02:05:54,827 --> 02:05:56,068
I HOPE YOU FEEL IT WAS WORTH IT.
I LOVED WATCHING YOU PLAY, THIS

2660
02:05:56,103 --> 02:05:59,827
WAS A GREAT SEASON OF SURVIVOR
AND TO THE PLAYERS, THE NONJURY

2661
02:05:59,862 --> 02:06:02,310
WHO AREN'T HERE, WE ARE SORRY
YOU AREN'T HERE.

2662
02:06:02,344 --> 02:06:04,241
WE WISH YOU COULD BE HERE AS WELL.

2663
02:06:04,275 --> 02:06:08,310
THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST TIME IN
THE JUNGLES OF FIJI AND TO ALL

2664
02:06:08,344 --> 02:06:10,275
OF YOU WITHOUT CONTINUE TO WATCH
SURVIVOR, WE THANK YOU.

2665
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:13,241
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU ARE FANS, WE
WHERE A TRIAD, SOME PEOPLE

2666
02:06:13,275 --> 02:06:16,379
PRODUCE, SOME PEOPLE PLAY, SOME
PEOPLE WATCH AND END UP PLAYING

2667
02:06:16,413 --> 02:06:18,724
AND COME BACK WATCHING.
BUT IT IS ALL THIS BIG

2668
02:06:18,758 --> 02:06:23,275
FAMILIMENT AND WE'VE HAD A BLAST
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BRINGING

2669
02:06:23,310 --> 02:06:30,206
YOU SURVIVOR 43 NEXT.
HERE'S YOUR FIRST LOOK.

2670
02:06:30,241 --> 02:06:34,586
IT WASN'T A MATTER OF IF I
WAS GOING TO PLAY SURVIVOR.

2671
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:41,482
IT WAS A MATTER OF WHEN.
I WENT FROM BEING IN A GANG

2672
02:06:41,517 --> 02:06:43,758
- TO BEING IN A Ph.
- D PROGRAM AT DUKE.

2673
02:06:43,793 --> 02:06:47,586
I JUST WANT TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN
DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

2674
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:51,758
I AM SCARED TO DEATH.
IT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE THE

2675
02:06:51,793 --> 02:06:57,724
HARDEST CHALLENGE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

2676
02:06:57,758 --> 02:07:00,758
DOES SURVIVOR MOVE FAST?
WE WHERE ON A JET.

2677
02:07:00,793 --> 02:07:04,931
IN THE OPERATING ROOM WHEN
THINGS GET REALLY INTENSE,

2678
02:07:04,965 --> 02:07:09,862
THAT'S WHEN I GET TO BE MY BEST.
SURVIVOR IS THE ULTIMATE GAME

2679
02:07:09,896 --> 02:07:13,206
AND HUMAN TEST.
THERE IS NOT ONE WAY TO WIN.

2680
02:07:13,241 --> 02:07:17,931
IF YOU HAD TO TAKE IN ALL OF THE
DATA AND KNOW WHEN TO STRIKE.

2681
02:07:17,965 --> 02:07:20,862
GROWING UP IN A TOUGH
ENVIRONMENT, THERE IS SOME CODES

2682
02:07:20,896 --> 02:07:23,172
TO GROW UP BY, I'M AN ETH KAL PERSON.

2683
02:07:23,206 --> 02:07:25,517
THERE ARE THINGS I WOULDN'T
CROSS THE LINE ON, LIKE I DON'T

2684
02:07:25,551 --> 02:07:29,517
THINK I WOULD-- YOU KNOW WHAT,
NO, THERE IS REALLY NOTHING I

2685
02:07:29,551 --> 02:07:34,862
WOULDN'T DO.
I LIVE TO GET RADICAL, THAT

2686
02:07:34,896 --> 02:07:40,137
SAY MANTRA OF MINE, I HAVE IT
TATTOOED ON MY BUTT CHEEK.

2687
02:07:40,172 --> 02:07:42,241
ONE THING DO I AS A
PSYCHOLOGIST IS GET PEOPLE TO DO

2688
02:07:42,275 --> 02:07:45,586
THINGS THEY DON'T WANT TO DO.
I'M HERE TO BE THE YOUNGEST

2689
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:47,758
EVER IN SURVIVOR HISTORY, WRITE
THIS DOWN, AT ALL COSTS.

2690
02:07:47,793 --> 02:07:51,000
IN THE GAME OF SURVIVOR YOU
WILL KNOW VICTORY.

2691
02:07:51,034 --> 02:08:01,034
YOU WILL KNOW PAIN.
BRING IT ON.

2692
02:08:01,068 --> 02:08:07,275
LET'S ALL VOM MORE CHAMPAGNE.
WHO CAN I GIVE SOME TOO.

2693
02:08:07,310 --> 02:08:12,379
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.

2694
02:08:12,413 --> 02:08:20,137
