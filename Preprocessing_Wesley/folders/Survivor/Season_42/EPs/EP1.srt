1
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:05,413
Well, last season birthed
a new era of <i>Survivor.</i>

2
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:10,758
<i>26 days,</i> <i>
a relentless pace, no food...</i>

3
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,068
I'm just really hungry.

4
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:13,586
<i>...penalties for losing...</i>

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,655
I need your flint.

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:17,448
<i>...and these crazy,</i> <i>
dangerous twists.</i>

7
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, my God.
Oh.

8
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:21,000
You are safe, my friend.

9
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:22,620
And what's really great is,

10
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,103
we shoot two seasons
back-to-back,

11
00:00:25,137 --> 00:00:28,241
which means this new group
of players for 42

12
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:31,517
has not seen anything
that happened in 41.

13
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:34,275
So we're going to use that
to our advantage in this way.

14
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,275
Some twists
will remain the same,

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,689
<i>like the crazy phrases</i> <i>
that you have to say</i>

16
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:40,862
<i>in front of other players</i> <i>
to activate your idol.</i>

17
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:44,034
<i>
"Potatoes have skin.</i> <i>
I have skin. Am I a potato?"</i>

18
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:45,137
<i>
But other twists,</i>

19
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:46,965
we're going to change
the variables a little bit

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,965
to see if it changes
how the players respond.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,586
<i>And some twists will be new.</i>

22
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,103
<i>It's another evolution</i>

23
00:00:58,137 --> 00:00:59,793
<i>in the greatest</i> <i>
social experiment</i>

24
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:01,724
<i>ever seen on television.</i>

25
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:19,793
<i>
I've waited for a long time</i>

26
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:21,724
<i>to be out here</i> <i>
playing</i> Survivor.

27
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:23,758
<i>I live</i> <i>
for challenges like this.</i>

28
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,034
I have a world record
in pull-ups

29
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:26,758
with 100 pounds on my back.

30
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:28,379
<i>I did 15 in a minute.</i>

31
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:30,896
<i>But this is like</i> <i>
the ultimate challenge.</i>

32
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:32,551
There's nothing like this.

33
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:34,275
Like, yeah,
there's a million world records,

34
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,965
but there's one <i>Survivor.</i>

35
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,379
<i>From the beginning,</i> <i>
I've had to fight</i>

36
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:44,379
<i>for people to believe in me,</i>

37
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:46,413
even doing hurdles half blind.

38
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:47,862
<i>They thought I was crazy.</i>

39
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:48,793
<i>I became</i> <i>
an all-American in hurdles.</i>

40
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:50,517
<i>Like, I fight,</i>

41
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:52,103
and I'm very competitive.

42
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:55,241
<i>Sometimes, I bring that</i> <i>
into certain situations, and</i>

43
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:56,724
they're just like,
"You're-you're too much, Drea."

44
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,137
<i>As an exotic animal</i> <i>
veterinarian,</i>

45
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:06,413
you never know what you're going
to see when you come into work.

46
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:08,965
It might be a tiny canary
with a fractured leg,

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,344
<i>or a giant rhino that you have
to put your hand up its butt.</i>

48
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:17,000
<i>I'm gonna come out into
this game acting like a pigeon,</i>

49
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:19,000
<i>something that's</i> <i>
nonthreatening, but really,</i>

50
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:20,758
I'm going to be
like the owl in the night.

51
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:22,793
You're not gonna hear
or see me coming

52
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:25,620
until you're dead
and Jeff is snuffing your torch.

53
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:32,068
<i>
As a young woman, as a Gen Z,</i>

54
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:35,034
<i>I feel way outside</i> <i>
of my comfort zone.</i>

55
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:36,586
I mean, the most
I've ever even camped

56
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,103
is at music festivals,
like, truly, like.

57
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,724
<i>It's definitely a weakness.</i> <i>
I mean,</i>

58
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:43,586
I'm an awkward runner,
I'm an awkward swimmer.

59
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,034
I'm nervous about the bug.

60
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:46,517
I will burn instantly.

61
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:47,689
I'm already worrying
I'm burning now.

62
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:49,068
Even sand. Sand is horrible,

63
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,344
especially, like,
when it, like, sticks

64
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,206
to your whole body. It sucks.

65
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:58,379
<i>
These 18 strangers have</i> <i>
left everything behind.</i>

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,172
<i>
I've been trying to get</i>

67
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:03,034
<i>on the show forever.</i> <i>
This is like</i>

68
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:04,275
a lifelong dream.

69
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:08,068
<i>
They're about to take part</i>

70
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:11,620
<i>in an adventure that will</i> <i>
forever change their lives.</i>

71
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:13,655
<i>There's something</i> <i>
for me that's here</i>

72
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:14,896
that I need to find.

73
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:19,103
<i>
A complicated</i> <i>
and dangerous game</i>

74
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,586
<i>designed to test them</i>

75
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,344
<i>by pushing them further</i> <i>
than ever before...</i>

76
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,034
<i>
How much farther</i> <i>
can I really go?</i>

77
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:26,827
How much potential
do I really have?

78
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:32,517
<i>
...forcing them</i> <i>
to adapt at every turn...</i>

79
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:34,758
<i>
Whatever twist Jeff is going</i> <i>
to throw at us,</i>

80
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:35,724
<i>I need to be prepared.</i>

81
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:39,620
...and challenging the beliefs</i>

82
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:42,655
<i>of what is possible for those</i> <i>
brave enough to say yes</i>

83
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,931
<i>to the adventure of a lifetime.</i>

84
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:47,137
You get one shot at this.
You get one shot.

85
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:48,517
<i>And I'm gonna give it</i> <i>
everything I got.</i>

86
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:54,482
Who will have what it takes
to outwit, outplay

87
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,241
and outlast all the rest?

88
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:59,275
This is <i>Survivor 42.</i>

89
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:15,172
Come on.

90
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:17,620
Come join me.

91
00:04:23,344 --> 00:04:25,724
<i>
Right now, it feels</i> <i>
like a roller coaster.</i>

92
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:28,689
The strap is on, the people
have done their final check,

93
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:30,413
and the roller coaster
just went like...

94
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:32,241
And it's now just
starting to move.

95
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,862
<i>And in this moment,</i> <i>
you have to decide,</i>

96
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:36,827
<i>are you going to raise your hand</i>

97
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,034
<i>to have the experience of your</i> <i>
lifetime, or are you gonna</i>

98
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:41,344
<i>close your eyes
and regret that for your life?</i>

99
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:43,034
My hands are going to be raised,

100
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:46,000
<i>and I'm going to be screaming</i> <i>
with everyone on this...</i>

101
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:47,034
whatever ride this is.

102
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:49,724
All right.

103
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:53,689
Welcome to <i>Survivor 42.</i>

104
00:04:57,275 --> 00:05:01,206
You are here, so excited.

105
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:04,758
It is so nice to be back
in Fiji where it is safe.

106
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:08,965
You all quarantined, everybody
tested, everybody is good to go.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,655
We can play <i>Survivor.</i>
Woman in the front-- your smile.

108
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,206
You haven't stopped smiling
since you got in the sand.

109
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:15,931
- What's your name?
- Maryanne.

110
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,137
Maryanne,
what is that enthusiasm?

111
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:20,793
How do you describe that
to your best friend?

112
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:22,275
It's, like, you dream
about this, you know?

113
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,896
You dream about, like,
going on <i>Survivor.</i>

114
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:25,413
Then you're like...
And all your friends are like,

115
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:27,034
"Maryanne, you're not gonna
make it on <i>Survivor."</i>

116
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:29,413
Like, so many people. And then
it's like, you're here,

117
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:31,793
and then it's like, like,
you know, like, you're here.

118
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:34,275
And, like, you're there
and, like, I'm here, and, like,

119
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,758
you're just like...
Like, I just want to,

120
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,896
like, jump up, run, scream.

121
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:39,482
Ah! It's so hard to keep it in.

122
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:44,000
Guy in the middle in the green.
What's your name?

123
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,758
Mike. How you doing, Jeff?

124
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:48,310
I'm out here with Jeff Probst.
Can you believe this?

125
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:50,275
- Holy crap.
- That'll go away fast.

126
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,413
- It will?
- Yeah.

127
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:53,586
Well, let me soak this in
for a few seconds first.

128
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,551
On the beach,
sand under my feet,

129
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:57,965
and Jeff Probst
is talking to me.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,965
It don't get better than that.
I can't wait

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,172
for my friends to see this.
They're not going to believe it.

132
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:05,310
So what does it take to win this game, Mike?

133
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:08,000
I think you need to be
diversified in all the areas--

134
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,689
social game,
your challenge game,

135
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:12,965
and even just how you act around
camp. I think it takes it all.

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,034
I think the person that comes
out and is more well-rounded

137
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:19,586
than the rest of us
will win this game.

138
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,379
- What's your name?
- Zach.

139
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:24,793
Zach, what does it take
to win <i>Survivor?</i>

140
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:27,758
I think
we're about to find out, Jeff.

141
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:30,000
What does that mean?

142
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:33,068
I don't know. I was trying, man.

143
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:35,068
It-it sounded cool.

144
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,310
I think it was the delivery

145
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,103
that I kind of, like,
miffed it on.

146
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:43,275
So, look around.

147
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,586
One of you is 26 days away
from winning <i>Survivor 42</i>

148
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,448
and the million dollars
that goes with it.

149
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:51,862
There are lots
of different ideas

150
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:53,758
about what it takes to win,

151
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:55,827
and you have
to continue to adapt.

152
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:57,827
That is the key,
which is why you got to think

153
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,517
of the game of <i>Survivor</i>

154
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:01,862
like it's the monster
in the horror movie.

155
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:07,068
Either you slay this game,
or the game will slay you.

156
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:09,068
I'm glad each of you are here,

157
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:12,758
and I hope that <i>Survivor</i> gives
you what you're looking for.

158
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:15,206
Let's get into it.
Let's start with our tribes.

159
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:18,655
- Over here on the left-- Taku.
- Yeah.

160
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,137
In the middle-- Vati.

161
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:23,655
And on the end,
wearing blue-- Ika.

162
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:26,517
Yeah!

163
00:07:26,551 --> 00:07:28,965
All right, are you ready
to get to your first test

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,896
as brand-new tribes?
Yeah!

165
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,896
All right,
here's what's going to happen.

166
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:38,758
On my go, one person
from each tribe is going to race

167
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:41,344
<i>into the jungle</i> <i>
and untie two paddles</i>

168
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,000
<i>from a cargo net.</i>

169
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:45,068
<i>They'll come back.
Another person from that tribe</i>

170
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:47,482
<i>will then race down
around the far end of the beach</i>

171
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:48,793
<i>and get two more paddles.</i>

172
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:50,448
<i>When you're back</i> <i>
with your paddles,</i>

173
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:53,758
<i>everybody gets in your boat</i> <i>
and you paddle out</i>

174
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:57,172
<i>and around the buoy, collecting</i> <i>
a bag of bamboo sticks.</i>

175
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:58,931
<i>One tribe member</i> <i>
will use those sticks</i>

176
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:02,482
<i>to try to retrieve that flint.</i>

177
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:06,000
<i>First tribe member to get</i> <i>
a flint earns for their tribe</i>

178
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:08,758
- a pot, a machete and a flint.
- Oh, my.

179
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:10,724
That's what you're starting
the game with.

180
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:12,827
No rice.

181
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:14,068
- No food source.
- Wow.

182
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:16,931
You haven't seen <i>Survivor 41.</i>

183
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:19,931
You're going to be on your own.
The new <i>Survivor</i>

184
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:24,241
is fast, it's difficult,
and it's dangerous.

185
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:26,758
<i>I don't know</i> <i>
about season 41, but</i>

186
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:28,862
watching 40 seasons of <i>Survivor,</i>
you have a general idea.

187
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,551
But when Jeff says,

188
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:33,931
<i>that's out the window, and</i> <i>
you don't know what to expect--</i>

189
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,241
<i>this is just wild.</i>

190
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:37,000
All right, tell me
who are the first runners

191
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,344
for the first leg?
Come right up here

192
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,862
in front of the green.

193
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:41,241
- Come on, my brother.
- Right next to each other.

194
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:42,689
Jonathan.

195
00:08:42,724 --> 00:08:44,724
All right, Jonathan!

196
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,758
- All right, Daniel.
- Yeah, let's go, Daniel!

197
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,206
He's pretty big, you know.

198
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:50,206
I got to win one
for the short guys here.

199
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:53,379
We have Jonathan, Daniel...

200
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,724
- Yes.
- ...and Tori gonna race on the first leg.

201
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:57,724
- Tori, you got this.
- Go, Jonathan!
- First challenge

202
00:08:57,758 --> 00:09:03,103
of <i>Survivor 42</i>
for basic camp supplies.

203
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:05,965
Here we go.
Survivors ready.

204
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,586
- Yes.
- Go.

205
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,965
Go, Tori!
- Jonathan, Daniel and Tori.

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,758
Yeah, Tori!

207
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:16,068
Two paddles tied to a cargo net.

208
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:21,241
Jonathan!

209
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:22,931
You got this, Jonathan!

210
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:25,068
The early moments
of <i>Survivor 42.</i>

211
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:27,310
You have no idea
what's happening back there.

212
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:29,724
- Jonathan!
- You've sent a relative stranger

213
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:31,827
to represent your tribe.

214
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,689
Who will come back first?

215
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:34,931
Let's go, Tori!

216
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,379
Come on, Tori!

217
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:40,862
Come on!

218
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,827
Oh!

219
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,689
- Let's go, Daniel!
- Come on, Daniel!

220
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:48,413
- Come on!
- Keep it up! Keep it up!

221
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:49,655
- Come on, Daniel!
- Here it is!

222
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,344
Jonathan with Tori right behind.

223
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:54,000
You're good. Go!

224
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:57,310
It's gonna be Lindsay.
Here comes Tori.

225
00:09:57,344 --> 00:10:00,758
You got to get there! Go.
Here comes Drea.

226
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:02,206
Go, Lindsay! Go, Lindsay! Go!

227
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:03,724
Go, Lindsay!
Go, Lindsay! Go!

228
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:06,310
Down and around the beach

229
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,068
trying to get two more paddles.

230
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:10,344
We're waiting for Daniel.

231
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:11,931
Here comes Daniel.

232
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:14,689
Got to get back.
Daniel takes a fall.

233
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:17,310
Keep digging, brother. You're on <i>Survivor.</i>
Got it.

234
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:19,172
- Drop it, drop it, drop it.
- Go. Hai's gonna head out now.

235
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:22,034
Go, Hai!

236
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,758
Get the pad...
Get the paddles ready.

237
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:28,344
You're okay. You're okay.

238
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,482
Come on, Lindsay!

239
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:31,413
You got this!

240
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,793
Lindsay!

241
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:39,413
I sprint, and I run around,
and I get there.

242
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:42,206
<i>And then, all of a sudden,</i> <i>
I see that there's this thing</i>

243
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,517
<i>that says you have to make</i>

244
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:45,517
<i>this decision,</i> <i>
but you have to wait</i>

245
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:46,448
<i>till everyone else gets there.</i>

246
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:48,344
I'm like,
"That's a huge twist," but

247
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:52,034
<i>clearly this is a much more
dangerous version of this game.</i>

248
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,655
Okay.

249
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:17,655
Okay.
- Well...

250
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:19,896
Hai, let's go!

251
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:21,724
Pros are,
we all have an advantage.

252
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:24,413
Come on! Let's go, Hai!
- Right, and also, con is

253
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:26,448
we are now being deceitful
immediately if...

254
00:11:26,482 --> 00:11:27,965
That's the game.
- We play... We came

255
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,241
to play the game, though.

256
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:30,655
But go with your gut.

257
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,241
My gut is that
it's only 26 days.

258
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,758
- Going fast.
- And that as long

259
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:37,034
as we get to merge

260
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:40,068
and the three of us know
and only the three of us know...

261
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:41,655
- It has to stay, just the three of us.
- I got y'all.

262
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:43,413
- Five finger.
- Otherwise we...

263
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:45,241
- we all crash and burn.
- Can you touch his pinkie?
- Pinkie.

264
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,206
This was an opportunity to build</i>

265
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,896
two instant connections
on other tribes.

266
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:52,931
<i>So for me</i> <i>
there was no other choice</i>

267
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,068
except to do it.

268
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:57,068
Hey, what's the lie?
Wait. What's the lie?

269
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,620
This is awesome! Wait. Let's

270
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,655
- help each other out here.
- Yo, this one is a long ride.

271
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:08,034
- It is. Man.
- Row.

272
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,000
A long time to get back.

273
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:13,689
Rest of the tribe can do nothing
until their tribe member is back

274
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:15,344
with those two paddles.

275
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,103
This is mud. Here, get it on.

276
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,827
- Wait.
- Oh, it's so cute.

277
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:22,482
- But I'm sorry.
- Yeah, just do it.

278
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:23,689
- Who cares?
- Wait. They're gonna be like,

279
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,137
- "What kind of freaking...?"
- Put it on my face, too.

280
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:26,620
- Oh!
- It has to look like...

281
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:28,034
All right, we have
to make it believable.

282
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:30,344
- Otherwise it's-it's obv...
- We can't just... Shh.

283
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:31,724
No one's back yet.

284
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:34,172
I've been on such a strict
skin care routine.

285
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:36,206
- This is good. It's mud.
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

286
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,034
Oh, my God.
I hope they're okay.

287
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:44,379
Wow. This is a hell of a run
you sent 'em on, Jeff.

288
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:49,241
Oh, my God. Come on.
No. You have to.

289
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:51,965
Okay.
Okay, I'll do that.

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,793
Oh, yeah.

291
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,172
Like, we have to do it.
This doesn't...

292
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:58,724
This doesn't look good at all.

293
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:00,068
Should we check on them?

294
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:10,034
Lindsay!

295
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,758
Oh, and it's Lindsay back
first.

296
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,620
Here comes Drea and Hai.

297
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,931
You're good.

298
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:22,965
Go ahead.

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,206
You guys ready?

300
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:25,275
Come on, Hai.

301
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,000
You're good.
Everybody in your boats.

302
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:33,000
Steady, girl.

303
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:36,000
All six people going
to be paddling.

304
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:38,931
It's going to be Taku
in the water first.

305
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,275
You got to go out
and around the buoy.

306
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,275
Get your bamboo sticks
on the way back.

307
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,793
Now we're straying.
Let's all go...

308
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:47,551
Ika is way off course.

309
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:50,517
They're struggling
just to not go backwards.

310
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,551
Stop paddling. Stop. Left. Stop.
Right, right, right.

311
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:54,034
- Row.
- Go.

312
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,965
Taku getting close to that buoy.

313
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:00,310
- Row!
- Now all of us, all of us.

314
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:03,275
It is Vati and Ika
in second place,

315
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,344
but Taku in the clear lead
right now.

316
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,931
Come on. Come on, come on.

317
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:09,620
You got to get
around that buoy...

318
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:10,931
All right.
...before you can get

319
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:13,482
the bamboo sticks
on your way back.

320
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:15,275
All right, guys.
Come on, we got this.

321
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,517
It is Taku still in the lead.

322
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:21,206
Taku now at the station
to get their bamboo sticks.

323
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,931
Now they're starting
to float away

324
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,344
- from the station.
- No!

325
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:27,586
Yeah.

326
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,344
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

327
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:33,379
Jump. All right,
paddle close to him.

328
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:34,724
Paddle close to him.

329
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:36,586
Jonathan gets up
on the platform for Taku,

330
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,689
untying knots with his bamboo.

331
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:43,068
Jonathan back in the water now.

332
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:46,379
Jonathan gonna swim back
to that boat.

333
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:51,413
Taku still in a very dominating
position right now.

334
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:52,689
It's now Vati finally
at the buoy.

335
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,931
Go! Good, guys, good!

336
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:57,275
And Ika right behind them.
- We got it.

337
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,620
Taku is back.
You got to get in.

338
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:00,793
You got to tie up.

339
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:05,586
Taku trying to get close
to that rope.

340
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,310
Look at that.
A miscalculation

341
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:10,068
about where they came in.

342
00:15:10,103 --> 00:15:13,413
Jonathan literally
dragging that boat over

343
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:16,413
so he can walk in.

344
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,413
Yeah!

345
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,206
- Now Vati at the platform.
- You got it, Lydia?

346
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:23,758
- Come on, baby.
- Working on

347
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:24,758
untying their bamboo sticks.

348
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,137
Don't lose me.
Don't lose me. Don't lose me.

349
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:28,655
Everyone get out?

350
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:31,965
Once that rope will reach,
try it.

351
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,172
One person now.

352
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:37,137
- Come on, Marya.
- Gonna be Marya using

353
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:40,172
the bamboo sticks. You're gonna
have to build a pole

354
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,551
that is long enough and strong
enough to reach that flint

355
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:45,413
and get it back to you.

356
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:47,896
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

357
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,862
Hold on!
Vati coming back now.

358
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:52,034
They have their bamboo sticks.

359
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:55,103
And Ika in blue now
at the platform.

360
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:58,517
Ika has their bamboo sticks.
They're heading back.

361
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:00,482
Taku with the early lead.

362
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:02,241
Tak-Tak-Taku!

363
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:06,241
Go, go!

364
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,689
Keep digging. You've got

365
00:16:08,724 --> 00:16:11,310
- to be tied in.
- One, two. Go, go, go. Come on.

366
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,068
- You're good. Head in.
- Come on, pull.

367
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:14,931
Daniel clearly injured.
- Come on!

368
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:16,241
Push!
That fall he took

369
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,275
in the beginning--
that right shoulder looks lame.

370
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,344
Got it. Got it.

371
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,965
- Come on.
- Let's go.

372
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,344
Hai now starting to work
on the bamboo sticks.

373
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:27,379
Rocksroy starting in
on the bamboo sticks.

374
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:29,965
Marya with a big lead

375
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,172
of time, allowing her
to work on her bamboo pole.

376
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:35,379
- You got it, girl.
- Yeah, can you give it a go?

377
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:38,862
Trying to see how much more
distance she needs.

378
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:41,000
She is not close.
All right, you better move it, Hai.

379
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,137
- Hai!
- Hai!
- Hai and Rocksroy are gaining.

380
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:46,551
It would be a huge comeback
for Ika

381
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:48,034
and a huge comeback for Vati

382
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,689
'cause they were
really out of it.

383
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:53,379
Good job, Rocksroy!
Marya absolutely patient.

384
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,344
Does she have it this time?

385
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,689
- It's looking better.
- There you go.

386
00:16:57,724 --> 00:17:00,275
She's got to get it high enough
to hook that ring.

387
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,896
Yeah! Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

388
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:04,275
Hai now gonna give it a go.

389
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,965
And here comes Rocksroy.

390
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,068
All three tribes are in it.

391
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:11,206
This is what you want minutes
into <i>Survivor 42.</i>

392
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:12,586
Oh, yeah, baby!
Rocksroy

393
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,551
- literally a half an inch away.
- Got it?

394
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:17,241
Closer. Closer.

395
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:18,793
Rocksroy's on the ring.

396
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:20,448
- Can he get it off?
- Let's go!

397
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:23,448
He's got it hooked.
He's got it off.

398
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:24,931
Now it's in the sand.

399
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:27,103
Now he's got to drag it.
Here comes Hai.

400
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,965
What is happening?
You can feel the pressure

401
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,896
- now kick in.
- Yeah, you got this.
- Good job.

402
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,793
Taku had a huge lead,

403
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:40,517
which puts the pressure
on Marya to pay it off.

404
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:44,896
You got this.
Rocksroy very patient,

405
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,448
but this is not
a good situation.

406
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:48,448
Keep dragging it!

407
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:50,068
Stick doesn't have
much leverage.

408
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,862
- There you go! There you go!
- It will take a great touch.

409
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:54,551
- Yes!
- Rocksroy's inside the ring.

410
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:58,068
Can he hook it again?
This would be a great maneuver.

411
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:01,655
And this might do it.

412
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,310
For the win for Ika.

413
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:07,172
- Yes!
- Yeah, baby!

414
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:11,827
Ika wins first challenge.
Huge job by Rocksroy,

415
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:14,034
earning camp supplies
for his tribe.

416
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:16,172
You're the man!
You are the man!

417
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:20,448
Sorry, guys.

418
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:22,551
Are you okay?
You're bleeding a lot.

419
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:25,655
Ika, congratulations.

420
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,931
Out of the gate, first victory.

421
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:29,862
Waiting for you
back at camp will be

422
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:32,689
your meager supplies:
a pot, machete and a flint.

423
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:34,172
As for the two losing tribes,

424
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,275
you have to go
to your new beaches now

425
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,413
and once again try in a new way

426
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:40,965
to earn your camp supplies.

427
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Ika, grab your stuff,
get in your boat.

428
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,827
You're heading out this way. Congratulations.

429
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:46,793
Get started building shelter.

430
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,793
Taku, grab your stuff,
head out.

431
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,068
You're going straight out.

432
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,241
<i>
I mean, I failed.</i>

433
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:56,068
My team set us up to win
and win big,

434
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:58,655
<i>but it's a lot harder
than I thought it was gonna be.</i>

435
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,758
<i>And so, my mindset is just</i>

436
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:02,172
buckle my seat belt.

437
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,689
Like, it's gonna be real.

438
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:05,689
All right, Vati,
before I send you out,

439
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:08,137
Daniel, clearly
your shoulder is hurting.

440
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:09,482
What happened?

441
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:12,034
I think I-I pulled
a Stephenie LaGrossa here,

442
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,137
and I think
it-it just popped out.

443
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:15,689
We're gonna bring medical in
before you head out.

444
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:17,172
Yes. Yes.
So you can paddle.

445
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,000
All right, medical,
let's come in.

446
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:23,517
All right,
so let's give a little space.

447
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:26,344
Just step back a little bit
so we can just talk with Daniel.

448
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,172
You got this, Daniel.
Yeah.

449
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:29,896
Let's sit you down
so that you're more comfortable

450
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:31,931
to start with. Yeah?
Okay. Okay.
Can you sit down?

451
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:34,206
It's whatever position is more comfortable for you.
- Okay.

452
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,034
All right...

453
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:37,724
Okay.

454
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,655
Is it something that
can be repaired?

455
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,068
- Okay.
- Just pop it. Pop it. I'm ready.

456
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:04,586
Okay.

457
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,172
- Just stay as relaxed as you're able to.
- I trust you.

458
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,896
- Oh, there we go. That feels so much better.
- Wow. I saw it.

459
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:10,206
Oh, my God.

460
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,586
Wow, Dr. Rae, well done.
Good job, Daniel.

461
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,758
Daniel,
you're a rock star right now.

462
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:17,275
Okay.

463
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:21,344
Okay. All right, thank you.

464
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:23,000
Thanks, Dr. Rae.
- I do love doctors.

465
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:25,172
Good job, Dan. Good job, Dan.

466
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,034
Thank you. Thank you.

467
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:28,517
All right, brother.

468
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:30,000
<i>We lost the challenge,</i> <i>
somebody got hurt.</i>

469
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:31,275
<i>We don't know how hurt he is.</i>

470
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,310
Also, we got no rice,
no flint, no machete, no pot.

471
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:35,758
<i>And I'm like, "Already?"</i>

472
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:38,482
<i>The first 15 minutes,</i> <i>
and we're in trouble.</i>

473
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:40,000
This is not a good start at all.

474
00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:58,241
- All right!
- We're here!

475
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:01,206
Oh, that's our stuff.
Oh, my God!

476
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:03,241
<i>
I'm a super duper fan.</i>

477
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:06,379
So getting to just sit
in this sand on this, like,

478
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:10,379
stupid tree thing is a dream.

479
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:12,068
- This is our shelter?
- This is for our shelter?

480
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:13,655
I mean, prime real estate.

481
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:18,103
<i>A new era of</i> Survivor <i>
is absolutely terrifying,</i>

482
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:20,965
because I know 40 seasons.

483
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,724
<i>I don't know last season.</i>

484
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm Zach.

485
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:27,482
I'm 21 years old,
and I'm a student.

486
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:30,034
But whatever is thrown my way,
bring it on.

487
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:32,310
I'm Drea. I'm 34.

488
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:33,724
Born and raised in Texas,

489
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:35,586
but I've lived in Montreal
for the past 12 years.

490
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,241
So, I'm Romeo. Uh...

491
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,551
I'm a pageant director.

492
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:40,034
I'm Rocksroy Bailey.

493
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:42,000
I am the old head here.

494
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,448
- I'm...
- No way. No.

495
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:44,931
I'm 43 years old.

496
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:48,034
Okay, hi, guys. My name's Tori.

497
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:50,896
Um, I work as a caregiver,
and I'm 24.

498
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:52,551
Um, I'm Swati. I'm 20.

499
00:21:52,586 --> 00:21:54,965
Um, I'm in
the Army National Guard,

500
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,896
and I'm a computer science student.
Oh, awesome.

501
00:21:57,931 --> 00:22:00,517
Being in the National Guard,
I think it'll be a real asset,

502
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,827
because young women,
as we have seen,

503
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:05,620
get voted out early on <i>Survivor</i>
pretty frequently.

504
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:08,482
So I think just having
that initial impression of me,

505
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:10,896
<i>of like, "Okay, she's going</i> <i>
to do her work around camp,</i>

506
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:13,172
<i>she's going to participate</i> <i>
in the challenges,"</i>

507
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,000
<i>will be super useful.</i>

508
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,655
<i>My family immigrated from India.</i>

509
00:22:16,689 --> 00:22:17,965
<i>They raised me by example</i>

510
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,310
<i>on hard work and discipline.</i>

511
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:22,862
And some people were surprised
when the hippie nerd

512
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:24,517
joined the Army National Guard,

513
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,827
<i>but to me the military
really exemplifies those values.</i>

514
00:22:27,862 --> 00:22:30,379
<i>Also, my education</i> <i>
was always a top priority.</i>

515
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:33,448
<i>Uh, not to flex, but I got into</i> <i>
every college I applied to.</i>

516
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:36,000
<i>And now I got into Harvard.</i>

517
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,206
<i>All I do at home is work and</i> <i>
maneuver my way to the top,</i>

518
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:40,275
and that's
what I'm about to do here.

519
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,655
Tell me how to say your name.

520
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:43,275
- Swati.
- Swati, Swati, Swati.

521
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,827
- Swati.
- Is it Tori?

522
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:46,379
- Yes. How'd you know?
- No way.

523
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:49,034
<i>So, my social strategy</i> <i>
coming into the game</i>

524
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,034
is, I want to tell people
and show people

525
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,517
what I want them
to think about me.

526
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:55,862
<i>So I told them I work
as a caregiver-- which is a lie.</i>

527
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:57,034
<i>I actually work as a therapist.</i>

528
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:59,206
But using
what I know in therapy

529
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,068
is totally what I'm going to do.

530
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:03,068
Are we, like,
the three young people?

531
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:04,137
I guess we are.

532
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:06,034
<i>So we quickly start</i> <i>
working on our shelter,</i>

533
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:08,517
<i>and the big kids go</i> <i>
to deal with the fire,</i>

534
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:10,586
<i>which leaves</i> <i>
the three youngest people,</i>

535
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,689
<i>we're doing the palm fronds.</i>

536
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,137
Wait, so do
you like Harry Potter?

537
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:14,482
Yeah, I mean,
I read all the books.

538
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,137
- There you go. True fan.
- Seen all the movies.

539
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:18,517
And I'm from Florida,
so I've been to the...

540
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:20,413
- the Wizarding World. Like...
- Oh, yeah. Have you ever had Butterbeer?

541
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:22,034
- Of course.
- How is it?

542
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,068
It's delicious.

543
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:24,655
<i>
So we're talking,</i>

544
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:27,172
<i>and I'm really trying</i> <i>
to let my nerdy self show.</i>

545
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,655
Oh, she knows her Harry Potter.

546
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:29,724
I love this.

547
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:31,482
'Cause I could just tell.
I picked up on that,

548
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:32,758
that that's the kind
of person they are.

549
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:35,551
Oh, man, they're
working hard on the fire.

550
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,310
Ah!

551
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:38,689
<i>So I don't want</i> <i>
to be with the big kids.</i>

552
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:40,275
Oh, my God.
- They get it?

553
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,034
<i>I want the people</i> <i>
who are a little quieter,</i>

554
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:43,310
<i>maybe on the outs.</i>

555
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:45,103
Good job.

556
00:23:45,137 --> 00:23:46,896
And, so far,
I think it's going well.

557
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:48,586
So...

558
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,068
- You're thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah.

559
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:55,586
Yes.

560
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:59,034
- Yeah, same.
- You remind me of back home.

561
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:01,241
I work in
the world of pageantry.

562
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:03,620
First impressions is
the most important thing.

563
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:07,344
<i>So right off the bat,</i> <i>
with Drea and Rocks,</i>

564
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,689
<i>I just got really good vibes</i> <i>
from them.</i>

565
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:10,068
Well, let's just start off
with this.

566
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:10,931
Yeah.

567
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:14,827
There you go.

568
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:21,793
<i>
Ever since I was a kid,</i> <i>
I wanted to do two things.</i>

569
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,034
<i>I couldn't win Miss Universe</i> <i>
because I'm a man,</i>

570
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:26,103
<i>but I could win</i> Survivor.

571
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:27,724
Let's talk about
building some homes.

572
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,551
Let's do it.

573
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:32,551
<i>Who would have thought a pageant</i> <i>
coach from South Central,</i>

574
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:34,758
this skinny kid,

575
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:37,379
<i>could be able to make alliances</i>

576
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:41,137
<i>and be chopping bamboo</i> <i>
with no problem.</i>

577
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:44,275
You good?

578
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,275
Yeah.

579
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,275
It's incredible.

580
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,586
One, two, three.

581
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:58,068
Holy crap.

582
00:24:58,103 --> 00:24:59,931
It's a lot different than TV,
huh, guys?

583
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,275
<i>
Vati tribe,</i>

584
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,000
our first challenge
of season 42, like,

585
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:05,241
<i>it was insane.</i>

586
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:06,793
Even the team that's in last
can finish it,

587
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:08,517
- so we don't give up.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Right.

588
00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:10,448
<i>
Daniel fell</i> <i>
and dislocated his shoulder,</i>

589
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:12,344
and now we have
no camp supplies.

590
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,655
So that is
definitely a setback

591
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:18,310
<i>going into a game where</i> <i>
we are not provided anything.</i>

592
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:20,448
"You failed
in your first attempt

593
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:21,896
at earning your supplies.
Here's your second chance."

594
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:38,827
Oh, my gosh.

595
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:52,206
Oh, God.

596
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,000
So we need to decide.

597
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:01,413
- Um...
- Okay.

598
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:03,413
<i>The choice of</i> <i>
our challenge was to get</i>

599
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:04,827
<i>probably the most important</i> <i>
things in the game:</i>

600
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:07,344
flint, machete, pot.

601
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:09,068
You can't do anything
without those three.

602
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:11,034
<i>So big decision,</i> <i>
we're in trouble.</i>

603
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:14,034
<i>Either we solve this puzzle,</i> <i>
or fill up that pot</i>

604
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:16,034
<i>and walk that back and forth</i> <i>
for four hours</i>

605
00:26:16,068 --> 00:26:17,862
and fill that 55-gallon drum up.

606
00:26:17,896 --> 00:26:19,137
<i>Now, looking around,</i>

607
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:21,034
<i>I saw that the person that
would be designated to do that</i>

608
00:26:21,068 --> 00:26:22,206
was yours truly.

609
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:23,413
<i>And they get to talk,</i>

610
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,241
<i>they get to rest,</i> <i>
I'm left out.</i>

611
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:27,689
I make sure to put
a kibosh on that right away.

612
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:29,379
Here's what I'm thinking.
That pot's heavy.

613
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:30,931
Yeah.
That's four hours.

614
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,896
It's one person.
I think we're a team.

615
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:34,379
Yeah.
We stick together, and we do the challenge

616
00:26:34,413 --> 00:26:35,724
that we're all involved in.
I agree.

617
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:37,379
So that way we all take
responsibility for it.

618
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:40,137
Who's good at stuff
like reading these triangles?

619
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:41,482
Do we-- Are you good at that?
Well, it's a visual...

620
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,931
I-I think I'm pretty good

621
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:44,482
with visual puzzles like that.
Okay, good.

622
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:46,034
All right.

623
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:47,896
Okay, okay.
This is...

624
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:49,827
Wait a minute.
Was that a trick?

625
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:51,482
No, it's not a trick. Listen.

626
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:53,379
If it seems easy, it's not easy.
Yeah. All right.

627
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:54,758
So should we all just do it?
Yeah.

628
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:01,241
Okay, I-I have my number.

629
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:02,103
I have mine.
Me, too.

630
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:03,620
I, uh, I'm still going.

631
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,000
Let's all say it on three.
Wait, wait, wait.

632
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:07,551
<i>So I start counting</i> <i>
the triangles,</i>

633
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:11,068
and how many of my tribe members
say "I got it"?

634
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:13,310
There's no way anyone
has it yet.

635
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:15,241
Let Jenny explain.
She's on to something.

636
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:17,241
I thought, "Good Lord.

637
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:19,931
These people are not
puzzle people."

638
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:22,793
So, one, two, three at the top, right?
One, two, three. Right.

639
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:26,068
This is a triangle. This is a triangle.
Damn.

640
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,758
You're right.
Oh, you're right.

641
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:31,137
<i>
I'm a designer,
and so I'm a very visual person.</i>

642
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:34,827
I'm also really methodical,
so I can pick things apart,

643
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,379
and I can see them visually.

644
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:40,724
So this is one,
including the two rows, right?

645
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:43,413
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Four, five, right?

646
00:27:43,448 --> 00:27:45,275
- That's another. So that's 20.
- Yeah.

647
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,620
<i>
So I just start showing</i> <i>
them the basic math of it,</i>

648
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:51,000
<i>and they look at me confused.</i>

649
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,724
<i>And at that point,</i>

650
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:56,413
I'm realizing I have to step up
and really lead this challenge,

651
00:27:56,448 --> 00:27:59,068
<i>so that I can get us</i> <i>
the tools that we need.</i>

652
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,689
There's no way.

653
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:15,896
It almost seems too easy.

654
00:28:18,724 --> 00:28:20,137
Six, seven, eight.

655
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:30,000
This isn't my strong suit, so...

656
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:32,551
Like, he saw 30 more triangles than me.
Yeah.

657
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,827
And I don't-- I-I feel like
I would get in the way.

658
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:37,275
You know, it's-it's better
to divide our resources anyways,

659
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,379
so that we can have somewhere to sleep tonight.
Yeah.

660
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:41,965
Ultimately,
the tribe decided to do Savvy,

661
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,689
<i>which is a puzzle.</i>

662
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:46,620
<i>I wanted to be the provider,</i> <i>
the strength,</i>

663
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:47,965
but I'm not gonna be
the puzzle guy.

664
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,827
<i>So, as a tribe,</i> <i>
we decided to split--</i>

665
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:52,655
half work on the puzzle,
half work on the shelter.

666
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:56,000
And then there were three.

667
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:59,034
<i>The hardest part</i> <i>
about this puzzle</i>

668
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:01,068
was remembering
what you already counted.

669
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:03,034
26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

670
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:04,344
Thirty-one.

671
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:05,551
Okay, I see...

672
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:08,241
No, no. The 30 is the 30.
That 30 is that...

673
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:09,896
- Oh, yes! Oh, my God.
- Okay.

674
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:11,000
<i>
The puzzle, it's like,</i>

675
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:12,344
you can see this triangle,
and it might go

676
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:13,827
and make a triangle like...
<i>♪ Doonk, doonk, doonk.</i>♪

677
00:29:13,862 --> 00:29:15,517
And then you're like,
"Yes. This is great."

678
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:16,724
<i>That's triangle number one.</i>

679
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:18,896
<i>You go to triangle number two,</i> <i>
three, four, five.</i>

680
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:21,000
And now you're at
triangle number six.

681
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:22,034
<i>Where's triangle number one?</i>

682
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:23,172
<i>You don't know.</i>

683
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:25,068
<i>And then after, you'll go,</i> <i>
you'll be like, "Oh,</i>

684
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:26,068
this is a cool triangle."

685
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:27,137
<i>♪ Doonk, doonk, doonk.</i>♪

686
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:29,068
<i>And then you'll double-count it.</i>

687
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:30,068
11, 12, 13, 14.

688
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,275
Fourteen?

689
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:35,068
<i>
It was so stressful</i>

690
00:29:35,103 --> 00:29:36,413
<i>just trying to keep track of,</i>

691
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:38,034
like, what have I counted?
What have I not counted?

692
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,965
Oh, oh, no, there's one.

693
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:44,724
<i>
The pressure is on</i>

694
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:46,620
<i>because you don't have</i> <i>
those tools.</i>

695
00:29:46,655 --> 00:29:48,137
<i>We can't start a fire.</i>

696
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:49,620
If rain comes, we're screwed.

697
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,000
<i>And of course,
we can't even build a shelter.</i>

698
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:53,413
Oh, my gosh.

699
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:56,724
Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

700
00:29:56,758 --> 00:29:57,655
Oh, my God.

701
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,517
46, 47, 48,

702
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,344
49.
Mm-hmm.

703
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,103
Yeah.
They have to come together.

704
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,103
That's what's tricky.

705
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:08,172
Yes.

706
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,827
Yep.

707
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,620
<i>Getting this number right</i> <i>
is the difference between</i>

708
00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:15,862
<i>being on the beach with nothing</i>

709
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:20,310
or having water and fire
and a shelter.

710
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:23,137
It is the difference between
literal survival in this game.

711
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:24,551
So, what are we at now?

712
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:25,586
We're at 50.
- 50.

713
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:29,965
I'm confident that
there are at least 50.

714
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,206
Yes.
Yeah.

715
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:32,137
Fifty.

716
00:30:32,172 --> 00:30:33,206
Okay.

717
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:35,517
And then we do
the drumroll, right?

718
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:36,620
Who's got the drumroll?

719
00:30:36,655 --> 00:30:37,896
Fifty-one.

720
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,689
So, 37 plus 14 is 51.
So...

721
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:41,137
So is that 51 three times?

722
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,206
I think it is.

723
00:30:43,724 --> 00:30:45,551
Or 51 and 52.

724
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:49,275
Once we got three in a row,
where we're like, "There's 51,"

725
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,827
we felt good about that.

726
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:52,034
<i>But even that's not enough,</i>

727
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:53,448
<i>'cause then you have</i> <i>
the final step</i>

728
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:55,620
<i>of what's your second number?</i>

729
00:30:55,655 --> 00:30:58,275
Did you count two
that were the same?

730
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,206
Or did you maybe miss one?

731
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:02,689
51 and 52.

732
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:03,689
We good?
- Yeah.

733
00:31:03,724 --> 00:31:05,034
- We good.
- God.

734
00:31:05,068 --> 00:31:07,448
This is the scariest
thing I've ever done in my life.

735
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:08,586
Do it slow.

736
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Okay, ready?

737
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:10,482
Let's go.

738
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:29,931
What? What?

739
00:31:29,965 --> 00:31:31,793
You guys rock.

740
00:31:31,827 --> 00:31:34,344
<i>
We have the flint,</i> <i>
we have the machete,</i>

741
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:36,206
<i>and we have the pot.</i>

742
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:39,034
And it's so funny how low
your standards go so quickly.

743
00:31:39,068 --> 00:31:41,724
I'm like, "Oh, my gosh,
we got bare necessities.

744
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:43,689
This is the best day
of my life!"

745
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:58,275
Hey, guys.

746
00:32:01,758 --> 00:32:03,793
Yeah.

747
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:06,793
Fifty-seven.

748
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,517
Never would've guessed that.

749
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:11,448
I try, brother. I try.
Listen, it's not easy.

750
00:32:11,482 --> 00:32:13,448
<i>Throughout my whole life,</i>

751
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:15,827
<i>people look at me</i> <i>
and think I'm a hard guy,</i>

752
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:16,931
<i>that I'm some guy</i>

753
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:18,275
<i>that's probably a little mean,</i> <i>
a little tough.</i>

754
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,275
You know, so it's my job
to soften that blow

755
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,206
because that's not who I am.

756
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:24,344
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.

757
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:28,206
I break rock.
That's how strong Mike is!

758
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:31,103
<i>
I'm so proud</i> <i>
of what I've done in my life.</i>

759
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:33,896
<i>The Hoboken Fire Department</i> <i>
was my career for 26 years.</i>

760
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:35,344
<i>Very proud</i> <i>
to put that uniform on.</i>

761
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:38,655
<i>It gave me a sense of pride.</i> <i>
I was actually</i>

762
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:41,482
<i>the first Puerto Rican</i> <i>
battalion chief in Hoboken.</i>

763
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:43,448
<i>You know, honestly,
I have very humble beginnings.</i>

764
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:45,896
<i>I was a kid in the projects,</i> <i>
running the streets.</i>

765
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:49,000
<i>My father was rough,</i> <i>
my mother was handicapped, so</i>

766
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,689
I had to work to...
to be who I am today.

767
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:53,655
You got it this time.

768
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:55,689
Yes.

769
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,517
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Yes.

770
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:58,586
Holy cow, baby.

771
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,482
- Yes. Here.
- Wow.

772
00:33:00,517 --> 00:33:02,000
Oh, my God, guys.

773
00:33:02,034 --> 00:33:03,931
There's only sidewalks
in Hoboken,

774
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:06,137
but I got a fire in <i>Survivor.</i>

775
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:08,310
Who says someone
from the city can't make fire?

776
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:09,965
High five, man.

777
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,310
- Now...
- Fireman gets the fire started.

778
00:33:11,344 --> 00:33:13,000
Jenny.

779
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:35,241
I know, hey, just go with it.
They're kids.

780
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:39,034
Yes!

781
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:41,068
The thing is,
my work ethic is different.

782
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:42,379
I like to get things done.

783
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:44,172
- This is not a vacation.
- I got you.

784
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:47,758
We're in the middle
of nowhere, people.

785
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,758
Guys, we got the...
we got the booty here.

786
00:33:49,793 --> 00:33:51,620
Guys, seriously, we need
to really seriously buckle down

787
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,068
and focus right now.
Okay.

788
00:33:53,103 --> 00:33:54,724
<i>
We're going to need firewood.</i>

789
00:33:54,758 --> 00:33:57,068
<i>We're going to need a place to
lay our heads. It's game time.</i>

790
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:59,413
Let's get crack-a-lackin'.

791
00:33:59,448 --> 00:34:03,413
Let's move your palm fronds
over this way, and then, Z,

792
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:05,172
if you can help me
pull out everything.

793
00:34:05,206 --> 00:34:07,344
<i>It was like herding cats.</i>

794
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,000
And I'm not a cat herder.

795
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:11,000
Got to get stuff done.

796
00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:13,448
<i>
In terms of the building</i> <i>
of the shelter...</i>

797
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:14,965
Got to get things done, man.

798
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,586
<i>
...I have one word.</i>

799
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,482
And that's Rocksroy.

800
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:20,241
Put it on this side--
here, over here.

801
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,241
This is why I'm moving this
out of this way.

802
00:34:22,275 --> 00:34:25,482
<i>
Rocksroy has taken on</i> <i>
the most leader-like role...</i>

803
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:27,068
Line 'em up like this.

804
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:29,034
<i>...that through 40 odd seasons</i>

805
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:31,034
I have ever seen in this game.

806
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,517
- I just need to sit for a minute.
- Just sit.

807
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:36,034
<i>
And in a new era of</i> Survivor,

808
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:37,931
it paints a huge target
on your back

809
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:39,310
<i>right out the gate.</i>

810
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:41,620
Let me know
if I'm being too lecture-y.

811
00:34:44,862 --> 00:34:47,034
Generations have changed,
you know?

812
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,448
<i>It's kind of</i> <i>
a little frustrating 'cause</i>

813
00:34:49,482 --> 00:34:53,137
<i>my kids are a lot more easier

814

<i>My kids are seven and five.</i>

817
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:03,379
<i>It's such a joy, like,</i>

818
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:05,517
just being there with the kids
all the time,

819
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:08,000
<i>watching them grow,</i> <i>
watching them develop.</i>

820
00:35:08,034 --> 00:35:10,862
<i>It's such a different mindset</i>

821
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:13,862
<i>to go from always being needed</i>

822
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:15,517
<i>for something with your kids.</i>

823
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:18,931
<i>And then when you're put</i> <i>
in this situation with</i>

824
00:35:18,965 --> 00:35:22,137
<i>adults, which you don't need</i> <i>
to teach them all the time,</i>

825

<i>it is a reset with my brain.</i>

826
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:27,034
It's a complete different way
of dealing with things.

827
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:29,586
<i>So I will have</i> <i>
to adapt to being</i>

00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,379
- Where did his stick go?
- Which one?

830
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:38,000
A wide stick so that we can
put another stick over it.

831
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:40,689
- Okay, I'm gonna go searching.
- Okay. Okay.

832
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:44,827
<i>
I have the advantage.</i> <i>
It's still in my bra.</i>

<i>That's when</i>

834
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:47,620

what's in my bra.

00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,620

Okay.

841
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:36,482
Cool.

842
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:37,793
Hide it in my pants.

843
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:42,034
<i>I kind of overestimated</i> <i>
this advantage</i>

844
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:44,310
<i>because the catch is really</i>

845
00:36:44,344 --> 00:36:45,482
crippling.

846
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:49,275
Not only do I have to reconnect

847
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,206
<i>with Lindsay and Drea</i> <i>
to use this thing.</i>

848
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:54,034
<i>I also have to consider</i> <i>
whether or not</i>

849
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:56,241
<i>I need</i> <i>
to take them out, because</i>

850
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:58,034
this thing becomes
more powerful.

851
00:36:58,068 --> 00:37:00,241
But they're thinking
the same thing.

852
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:06,551
<i>
So now it's like</i> <i>
this complex web</i>

853
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:08,379
<i>of, like, game theory.</i>

854
00:37:08,413 --> 00:37:10,931
Are you going to strike?
And who's going to strike first?

855
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:20,482
<i>
Okay. Yeah.</i>

856
00:37:20,517 --> 00:37:21,689
<i>Fire talk.</i>

857
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:23,172
Okay...

858
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:26,482
- Yeah.
- Very good story

859
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:27,620
that has a little bit
of a twist to it,

860
00:37:27,655 --> 00:37:28,793
a little bit of a turn to it,

861
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:30,655
- a little bit of strangeness.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

862
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:34,413
Okay, so I applied for <i>Survivor</i>
one time ten years ago.

863
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:36,241
When I first started watching.

864
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:38,655
Oh, my gosh.
- But here's the twist.

865
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,413
- You ready?
- Yeah.

866
00:37:41,448 --> 00:37:44,379
I applied as a girl. Yeah.
Get out.
Ooh.

867
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:46,758
Wow.
Oh.

868
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:48,896
Yeah. So I don't want
to hide anything

869
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,655
from you guys
'cause that's my true self.

870
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:52,655
Right.
Mm-hmm.
- I'm a transgender guy.

871
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,793
I started transitioning about
eight and a half years ago.

872
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:57,448
Uh-huh.
Wow.
- I had not told my parents.

873
00:37:57,482 --> 00:37:58,896
Scared to death
to tell the parents

874
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:01,551
because I already knew
how they felt about it.

875
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:04,275
<i>I was born</i>

876
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,793
a girl.
I didn't feel like a girl.

877
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:12,103
<i>And I struggled with it.</i> <i>
Made me a very angry, sad,</i>

878
00:38:12,137 --> 00:38:14,275
depressed person.

879
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,000
<i>And when I told my parents,</i> <i>
it was not accepted,</i>

880
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:21,965
<i>and so, I had to live my life
away from my family, which was</i>

881
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,137
very difficult because
I was very, very, very close

882
00:38:23,172 --> 00:38:25,034
to my mother.

883
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:27,896
<i>While I was transitioning, my
mother had gotten really sick,</i>

884
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:30,551
<i>and my father had invited me</i> <i>
to come see her.</i>

885
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:32,103
<i>I said, "Let's bring her home."</i>

886
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:33,275
And he said, "Well, we can't

887
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,275
'cause we have
to have full-time care."

888
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,379
And I said, "So I'll move here,

889
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:38,517
and we'll take care of her
full-time."

890
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,620
<i>My father and I were never</i> <i>
close at all,</i>

891
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,310
<i>and during that time,</i> <i>
because we had</i>

892
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:47,172
<i>to spend literally</i> <i>
every day together,</i>

893
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:49,724
<i>we started to get</i> <i>
to know each other, and then,</i>

894
00:38:49,758 --> 00:38:51,896
next thing he was asking,
did I have anybody in my life.

895
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:54,551
I'm like,
"Well, I'm actually married."

896
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:56,206
And he's like,
"Well, I'd like to meet her."

897
00:38:56,241 --> 00:38:57,655
<i>And I thought,</i> <i>
"Well, that would be great.</i>

898
00:38:57,689 --> 00:38:59,275
<i>She's a nurse.</i> <i>
She could help."</i>

899
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,379
<i>And so my wife got</i> <i>
to meet my dad.</i>

900
00:39:01,413 --> 00:39:03,862
And they ended up
becoming close.

901
00:39:03,896 --> 00:39:05,275
My mother and I were
very, very close.

902
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,931
And she started getting worse
and worse and...

903
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:11,896
um, she-she passed away.

904
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:13,724
<i>My father would ask me,</i>

905
00:39:13,758 --> 00:39:15,275
"Why did your mother get sick?"

906
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,517
And I said, "'Cause I think
this was the plan.

907
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:20,586
You and I got a relationship,
and Mom got to know who I was."

908
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,620
So I tell you guys this
because I want to be honest

909
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:24,241
about who I am.

910
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:25,896
Survivor <i>makes you take</i>

911
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:29,689
everything and peel it off
and be vulnerable and open.

912
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:32,275
<i>And for me, that's</i> <i>
a huge testament for someone</i>

913
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,034
<i>who's always hid,</i> <i>
like, who I was.</i>

914
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:36,586
My goal is to get
to the million dollars.

915
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,275
But if that doesn't happen,
the fact

916
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,758
that I tried it
is a huge testament

917
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:45,172
to someone
who hid their whole life.

918
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:46,896
So there's your fire talk.

919
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:48,206
It's a great fire talk.

920
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,448
You're doing a great job, man.
Good job.

921
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:56,379
- Our hold's gonna be better.
- Yeah.

922
00:39:56,413 --> 00:39:57,689
We got a roof.

923
00:39:57,724 --> 00:39:59,241
<i>
Oh, my gosh.</i>

924
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:02,172
Day two, and I'm nowhere
near crying. Thank God.

925
00:40:02,206 --> 00:40:03,310
I think it's by, um...

926
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:06,931
<i>
But, like, it's crazy.</i>

927
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:08,344
<i>I think this is already</i>

928
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:10,724
<i>way harder than normal</i>
Survivors

929
00:40:10,758 --> 00:40:12,689
<i>'cause they have so much</i> <i>
more stuff to really work with.</i>

930
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:14,620
Can you try
to just flip it up again?

931
00:40:14,655 --> 00:40:16,275
<i>I mean, we don't even have rope.</i> <i>
We're literally</i>

932
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,034
<i>just, like-- aah!--</i> <i>
putting things up,</i>

933
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:19,586
and fingers crossed, you know?

934
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,103
<i>
I really felt</i>

935
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:25,448
some sort of, like, connection.

936
00:40:32,586 --> 00:40:34,034
<i>
So right now, Lydia</i>

937
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:35,724
<i>and Hai seem like</i> <i>
they get along well.</i>

938
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:37,931
Trust me, I got you.

939
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:40,448
<i>
And it seems
like Jenny and Mike are a duo.</i>

940
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:42,448
And that leaves me
and Daniel to be a duo.

941
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:43,724
Nothing's going
to happen without,

942
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:46,206
like, me cluing you in or...

943
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:47,724
You have to trust someone
to have your back

944
00:40:47,758 --> 00:40:49,034
- in the conversation.
- Yes.

945
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:50,551
- I got you.
- Yeah.

946
00:40:50,586 --> 00:40:51,896
- You don't have to worry. I'm solid.
- Okay.

947
00:40:51,931 --> 00:40:53,241
I like everyone in this tribe.</i>

948
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:55,310
There is no dud in this tribe.

949
00:40:57,586 --> 00:40:59,862
I get, I get
good vibes from you, too.

950
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:01,793
<i>
It seems like</i> <i>
I've made good connections</i>

951
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,241
<i>with people thus far,</i>

952
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:05,655
to my delight
and surprise, actually.

953
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:07,034
Dude, I wouldn't even know
you had a bad shoulder

954
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:08,413
- if-if...
- Good.

955
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:09,517
<i>
Like, a lot of people after</i>

956
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,862
I potentially lost the challenge
for the tribe

957
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:13,448
and, like,
dislocated my shoulder,

958
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:16,655
<i>would have totally used that</i> <i>
to destroy my game,</i>

959
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:18,206
<i>and they didn't.</i>

960
00:41:18,241 --> 00:41:20,000
It just means so much
to be here right now.

961
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:23,000
Um...

962
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:28,482
- It is a childhood leukemia scar.
- Oh, my God, you're...

963
00:41:28,517 --> 00:41:30,275
- Yeah.
- Good for you, but you're good?

964
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,379
- Yeah, I'm fully cured. Fully cured.
- Good for you, man.

965
00:41:32,413 --> 00:41:33,793
- Good for you.
- Yeah, that's amazing.
- Yeah.

966
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,655
Wow.
- Yeah.

967
00:41:35,689 --> 00:41:39,310
<i>At age 15,
I was diagnosed with leukemia.</i>

968
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:41,551
<i>I went through, like,</i> <i>
three years of chemotherapy.</i>

969
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:44,482
<i>And one of the things
that helped me through all this</i>

970
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:46,827
<i>was watching</i> Survivor.

971
00:41:46,862 --> 00:41:49,068
<i>It was just a way</i>

972
00:41:49,103 --> 00:41:51,965
of enjoying something that
brought me to a different world.

973
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,758
It was rough, but

974
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:58,206
it was the best type of cancer
you can get if you're a kid.

975
00:41:58,241 --> 00:41:59,793
It was the most treatable.

976
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:03,827
<i>So the idea to now go</i> <i>
from a hospital bed</i>

977
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:07,034
<i>where I could not support</i> <i>
myself and have the strength</i>

978
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:10,551
<i>to, like, brush my teeth to,
like, being on an island about</i>

979
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:12,275
to have the adventure
of a lifetime--

980
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,620
it's, uh... it's surreal.
It's absolutely...

981
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,827
Then how could I not say yes
to that-that opportunity?

982
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:20,000
- Yeah, it means a lot to be here.
- Yeah.

983
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:22,000
So, yeah, it's great.
Awesome.

984
00:42:22,034 --> 00:42:23,896
But the number one reason
I am here

985
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:27,103
<i>is because there is,</i> <i>
like, some kid out there</i>

986
00:42:27,137 --> 00:42:29,827
<i>in some hospital bed longing</i>

987
00:42:29,862 --> 00:42:33,310
<i>to have an adventure</i> <i>
of this sort or just, like,</i>

988
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:36,482
leave the hospital,
and I am out here

989
00:42:36,517 --> 00:42:38,413
because I'm playing
for that kid.

990
00:42:42,655 --> 00:42:44,275
<i>
Who wants water?</i>

991
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,517
No one else wants it? Okay.
Thank you.

992
00:42:47,827 --> 00:42:49,965
You know, I weighed in
before I came here.

993
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,379
- How much?
- I'm, like, literally 118.

994
00:42:53,413 --> 00:42:55,482
You're... you were more
than me. I was 112.

995
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,206
Dude, but 118 is the highest

996
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,517
- I've ever been.
- But how tall are you?

997
00:42:58,551 --> 00:43:00,000
<i>
I like Romeo.</i>

998
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:03,275
We're both, you know, ripped.

999
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:07,448
<i>But trying to make an ally
on</i> Survivor <i>is one of the most</i>

1000
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:10,034
awkward experiences
I've ever been in.

1001
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:11,413
- Yeah.
- The most I've been is 118.

1002
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:13,034
It's like waiting to be kissed.</i>

1003
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:14,793
<i>You need to be willing</i> <i>
to make that move,</i>

1004
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:17,379
to lean in, but it's terrifying.

1005
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:19,620
And what if you lean in,
they don't lean back?

1006
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:23,586
<i>But the first convo</i> <i>
I have with Romeo,</i>

1007
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,793
he asks me...

1008
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:28,241
How are <i>you</i> feeling? I was about
to ask you, how are you feeling?

1009
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,689
<i>To me that's like,</i>

1010
00:43:29,724 --> 00:43:32,344
"Ding, ding."
Like, those are the words.

1011
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:34,206
That's... Like, that's
the words you're waiting for

1012
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:35,931
as a <i>Survivor</i> player.

1013
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:39,034
I'm going to talk to you like
superfan to superfan, right?

1014
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:42,551
- Yeah.
- I feel good about this tribe, and you're the person

1015
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,275
that, like, I just relate to
the most, and I feel...

1016
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,275
I, too. Even when I saw you, I
was like, "We're both, like..."

1017
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,137
That's what I said.
I literally...

1018
00:43:54,724 --> 00:43:57,068
- Taro?
- I think she said she saw a...

1019
00:43:57,103 --> 00:43:59,620
I don't even know what taro is.
Isn't that, like, cards?

1020
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:01,137
She saw... she saw, like,
a taro leaf.

1021
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:04,206
I think it's taro leaves,
which means it has a root.

1022
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:09,793
I mean, look, there's, like,
literally one thing to do

1023
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:10,862
on <i>Survivor.</i>

1024
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:16,000
<i>
I know this game. I know</i>

1025
00:44:16,034 --> 00:44:19,000
you do not go off on your own
for an extended period of time.

1026
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:21,068
<i>But, so, I'm like,</i> <i>
"This is good. People know</i>

1027
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:22,793
<i>I'm looking for taro."</i>

1028
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:26,310
<i>Little do they know, I did look</i> <i>
around for an immunity idol.</i>

1029
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:29,137
<i>Like, I'm on</i> Survivor. <i>
I'm here to play.</i>

1030
00:44:29,172 --> 00:44:30,482
<i>But they're never</i> <i>
gonna know that.</i>

1031
00:44:32,344 --> 00:44:34,068
She's first.

1032
00:44:39,862 --> 00:44:43,827
<i>
Then I come back,</i> <i>
and something's off.</i>

1033
00:44:43,862 --> 00:44:44,758
<i>Something feels weird.</i>

1034
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:46,310
<i>I feel myself being nervous.</i>

1035
00:44:46,344 --> 00:44:49,620
<i>Almost, I feel guilty
as if I've done something wrong</i>

1036
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:51,758
because I went to go try
to find food for my tribe,

1037
00:44:51,793 --> 00:44:54,000
but I wasn't able to do so.

1038
00:44:55,551 --> 00:44:58,172
Uh, I just want to let you know
that Drea is, like...

1039
00:44:58,206 --> 00:45:00,000
- like, bringing your name up.
- Oh, really?

1040
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:02,034
Yeah, and it's, like,
it's all about

1041
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:04,586
that, like, uh...
that idol thing.

1042
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,344
<i>
There's these rumors</i> <i>
already being spread.</i>

1043
00:45:06,379 --> 00:45:08,413
<i>That, to me, is, like,</i>

1044
00:45:08,448 --> 00:45:09,931
<i>you're seeing your hopes</i> <i>
and dreams dashed</i>

1045
00:45:09,965 --> 00:45:12,206
<i>before your very eyes because</i>

1046
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:15,620
you, yourself, I...
I made a very stupid decision.

1047
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,241
<i>Am I going to work through this</i>

1048
00:45:18,275 --> 00:45:20,724
<i>and turn this around somehow</i> <i>
in my favor?</i>

1049
00:45:20,758 --> 00:45:22,620
<i>I'm going</i> <i>
to find a way to do so.</i>

1050
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:36,034
You guys, there's a boat.

1051
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:37,724
Come on!

1052
00:45:37,758 --> 00:45:39,551
<i>We're just working</i> <i>
on the shelter.</i>

1053
00:45:39,586 --> 00:45:42,068
<i>And then I hear a "Om"</i> <i>
in the distance.</i>

1054
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:43,724
<i>I'm like, "Oh, my goodness."</i>

1055
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:46,068
What is a boat doing here
on day two?

1056
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:48,413
<i>Jeff wasn't kidding when he was</i> <i>
saying this was fast-paced.</i>

1057
00:45:48,448 --> 00:45:49,896
Thank you.

1058
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:58,448
Any volunteers?

1059
00:45:58,482 --> 00:45:59,862
That's it.
You know what? Y'all...

1060
00:45:59,896 --> 00:46:01,103
<i>
In my mind, I'm like,</i>

1061
00:46:01,137 --> 00:46:02,655
<i>"I want to get on this boat."</i>

1062
00:46:02,689 --> 00:46:04,517
But every single <i>
Survivor</i> fan knows

1063
00:46:04,551 --> 00:46:06,310
that if you leave the tribe,

1064
00:46:06,344 --> 00:46:07,827
<i>that puts you on the outs.</i>

1065
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:10,068
I've just been weaving
palm fronds.

1066
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:13,275
If I'm the sacrifice, I'm fine,
if everyone's fine with that.

1067
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,344
Yeah!

1068
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:15,827
I don't...
I don't mind if you go.

1069
00:46:15,862 --> 00:46:17,689
I'm just like, "Look, Maryanne,</i>

1070
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:19,379
<i>"this boat probably</i> <i>
has something</i>

1071
00:46:19,413 --> 00:46:20,206
that we want to know about."

1072
00:46:22,068 --> 00:46:24,586
<i>So in that moment, I decided,</i>

1073
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,896
I'm going
to take one for the team.

1074
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:28,413
Taku strong!

1075
00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:31,551
<i>
Come on, let's do it.</i>

1076
00:46:31,586 --> 00:46:32,896
<i>All right.</i>

1077
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:35,413
- On three.
- Ah!

1078
00:46:35,448 --> 00:46:36,620
Is it Jenny?
I think it's Jenny.

1079
00:46:36,655 --> 00:46:37,862
Hold down the fort, Jenny.

1080
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:40,206
Yeah.

1081
00:46:40,241 --> 00:46:42,275
Drawing the shortest straw
makes me nervous,

1082
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,655
<i>because what's going to happen</i> <i>
when I get out there?</i>

1083
00:46:47,758 --> 00:46:50,724
Oh! She's going.

1084
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:52,206
Drea! Congrats.
Drea!
You got it.

1085
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:54,379
<i>
I came to play, and I know</i>

1086
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:56,344
that whatever it is
will be an advantage.

1087
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:57,758
Represent!

1088
00:46:57,793 --> 00:46:59,172
<i>
And I want as many</i>

1089
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:00,862
advantages as I can get
in this game.

1090
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:12,310
<i>
This boat takes us</i>

1091
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:16,275
<i>to this beautiful island,</i> <i>
and I'm starting</i>

1092
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,965
to feel excited
because I don't know what is

1093
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,827
<i>at the other end of this boat.</i>

1094
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:24,172
<i>Maybe this is good.</i>

1095
00:47:26,965 --> 00:47:28,310
- I'm Maryanne.
- Drea.

1096
00:47:28,344 --> 00:47:29,931
- Drea?
- Yeah.

1097
00:47:29,965 --> 00:47:31,689
Jenny.
Jenny.

1098
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,344
Hey, nice to meet you here.
It's so exciting to be here.

1099
00:47:33,379 --> 00:47:35,344
- Um... Okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

1100
00:47:35,379 --> 00:47:37,000
It's a summit.

1101
00:47:37,034 --> 00:47:39,241
"Follow the path to the summit.

1102
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:41,137
Take this time
to get to know each other."

1103
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:43,241
- Oh, my God.
- There better be food.

1104
00:47:43,275 --> 00:47:45,137
Please be food.

1105
00:47:45,172 --> 00:47:46,827
Rice? Yeah, but...

1106
00:47:46,862 --> 00:47:49,275
<i>
We start hiking,</i> <i>
and I think, "Okay.</i>

1107
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,586
"We're walking just over
this little hillside,

1108
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,448
"and right over that ledge

1109
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:56,862
will be a beautiful picnic
set up for us."

1110
00:48:08,172 --> 00:48:10,137
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe it.

1111
00:48:10,172 --> 00:48:12,034
Oh, my goodness.
This is insane.

1112
00:48:12,068 --> 00:48:14,965
Oh, yeah. This is, like,
still surreal for me.

1113
00:48:17,586 --> 00:48:19,310
Yeah!
I know! You poor thing!

1114
00:48:19,344 --> 00:48:21,137
<i>
I feel as if</i>

1115
00:48:21,172 --> 00:48:23,172
I have gone through a lot
of, like, adversity.

1116
00:48:23,206 --> 00:48:25,517
<i>So I think that, honestly, like,</i>

1117
00:48:25,551 --> 00:48:27,344
<i>it's built me</i> <i>
to be a stronger person.</i>

1118
00:48:28,586 --> 00:48:32,379
<i>♪ Happy birthday, Maryanne.</i>♪

1119
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:36,310
<i>
My parents are both</i> <i>
originally from Kenya.</i>

1120
00:48:36,344 --> 00:48:39,310
<i>When I told my mom I was</i> <i>
first interested in</i> Survivor,

1121
00:48:39,344 --> 00:48:42,034
she was like, "Maryanne, why are
you interested in this show?"

1122
00:48:42,068 --> 00:48:43,758
<i>She was so confused.</i> <i>
She was like,</i>

1123
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:46,689
<i>"Why does Maryanne want to go
on an island to, like, starve?"</i>

1124
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:48,724
<i>But the reason why</i> <i>
I think I'm here is</i>

1125
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:50,724
<i>because I've always struggled</i> <i>
with, like,</i>

1126
00:48:50,758 --> 00:48:53,068
self-esteem issues 'cause I was
a pretty weird kid growing up.

1127
00:48:53,103 --> 00:48:57,931
<i>Like, I remember, like,
just dreading going on the bus</i>

1128
00:48:57,965 --> 00:48:59,379
<i>because people would always</i> <i>
pick on me,</i>

1129
00:48:59,413 --> 00:49:02,000
<i>but I can be me on this show.</i>

1130
00:49:02,034 --> 00:49:04,310
And, like, <i>Survivor</i> is a way
where not only I can go

1131
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:07,034
and test my own limits, but
I can show the people, as well.

1132
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:08,793
It's like,
"Hey, like, look at you.

1133
00:49:08,827 --> 00:49:10,482
"You're someone who's weird

1134
00:49:10,517 --> 00:49:13,241
<i>who didn't have to change</i> <i>
themselves to succeed."</i>

1135
00:49:13,275 --> 00:49:15,379
<i>And, like, maybe there's someone</i> <i>
who's watching this</i>

1136
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:17,551
that needs that,
and I want to be like,

1137
00:49:17,586 --> 00:49:20,275
"Hey, I'm here. I'm weird.

1138
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,586
"You can be weird, too,
and you can win,

1139
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,379
"and you can succeed,

1140
00:49:24,413 --> 00:49:26,068
and you don't have to change
anything about yourself."

1141
00:49:26,103 --> 00:49:30,758
<i>I truly want</i> Survivor <i>to be</i> <i>
such a big experience for me.</i>

1142
00:49:30,793 --> 00:49:32,758
<i>It's like,</i> <i>
the million dollars--</i>

1143
00:49:32,793 --> 00:49:34,724
<i>I don't really care about that.</i>

1144
00:49:34,758 --> 00:49:36,827
It's the title of Sole Survivor,
and it's the growth

1145
00:49:36,862 --> 00:49:38,137
that you get
to get to that title.

1146
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:39,655
That's what I'm here for.

1147
00:49:39,689 --> 00:49:41,896
We're here?

1148
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:43,655
Oh, my gosh.

1149
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:48,034
"You will now separate
and make a private decision

1150
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,931
before returning to camp."

1151
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:52,103
- Okay.
- All right, guys.

1152
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:53,551
- Here we go.
- Good luck.

1153
00:49:53,586 --> 00:49:55,068
Yeah.

1154
00:49:59,827 --> 00:50:02,103
What do we have here?

1155
00:50:04,517 --> 00:50:06,931
Oh. Oh.

1156
00:50:15,241 --> 00:50:18,379
"Protect your vote or...
risk your vote."

1157
00:50:18,413 --> 00:50:20,103
Oh, my God.
The prisoner's dilemma.

1158
00:50:38,137 --> 00:50:39,275
Ah.

1159
00:50:54,931 --> 00:50:56,137
Oh, my gosh.

1160
00:50:57,586 --> 00:50:59,758
Oh, God,
please give me information.

1161
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:02,000
I don't know these people.

1162
00:51:02,034 --> 00:51:04,448
We just met, so...

1163
00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm going to take another risk.

1164
00:51:09,172 --> 00:51:10,896
Let's go.

1165
00:51:10,931 --> 00:51:12,620
A lot of times,
Christians play this game,

1166
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:14,103
and when they're out
of the game, they always say,

1167
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,620
"Man, I wish
I'd played more cutthroat.

1168
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,137
I wish I risked it."

1169
00:51:18,172 --> 00:51:19,551
And I knew coming to this game,

1170
00:51:19,586 --> 00:51:20,827
I wouldn't want
to make that mistake.

1171
00:51:20,862 --> 00:51:22,310
So even though it's terrifying

1172
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:24,000
and it might bite me
in the butt,

1173
00:51:24,034 --> 00:51:25,206
I think I'm going
to risk my vote.

1174
00:51:29,413 --> 00:51:31,827
I need to think about whether

1175
00:51:31,862 --> 00:51:35,551
all of us are willing
to take that chance or not.

1176
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:40,620
I think they both might risk it
for different reasons

1177
00:51:40,655 --> 00:51:43,620
<i>and then receive an extra vote.</i>

1178
00:51:43,655 --> 00:51:47,793
<i>And I've got nothing,</i> <i>
but I need to play it safe...</i>

1179
00:51:47,827 --> 00:51:49,206
Ugh.

1180
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:51,655
<i>...and protect my vote.</i>

1181
00:52:00,758 --> 00:52:01,793
<i>
All right, Jackson,</i>

1182
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,896
<i>you want me</i> <i>
to fill up your water bottle?</i>

1183
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,034
But all in love,
'cause if you were saying

1184
00:52:07,068 --> 00:52:08,965
you were dizzy for ten hours,
I can't have you like that.

1185
00:52:29,586 --> 00:52:32,827
Counseling-- that's always
what I wanted to do,

1186
00:52:32,862 --> 00:52:34,862
but take...
There's Jeff.

1187
00:52:34,896 --> 00:52:36,862
No! No, it's not.

1188
00:52:36,896 --> 00:52:38,724
That is Jeff.
No, it's not Jeff.

1189
00:52:38,758 --> 00:52:40,724
What does he want to say to us?
That's Jeff.

1190
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:43,206
No.
Oh, no.
Stop.

1191
00:52:43,241 --> 00:52:44,724
Hello, Taku.

1192
00:52:44,758 --> 00:52:45,965
Hello, hello.

1193
00:52:47,758 --> 00:52:49,862
Pretty cool. This is impressive

1194
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:51,896
for just three days
into this game.

1195
00:52:51,931 --> 00:52:53,137
Thanks.
All right, and

1196
00:52:53,172 --> 00:52:56,379
I rarely come to a tribe camp,
and especially this early.

1197
00:52:56,413 --> 00:52:58,655
And so I came here
with a purpose,

1198
00:52:58,689 --> 00:53:01,827
and it was to have a little
one-on-one with Jackson.

1199
00:53:01,862 --> 00:53:04,241
- Can I borrow you?
- Yeah.

1200
00:53:04,275 --> 00:53:06,241
- You can head down this way.
- Oh.

1201
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:14,000
So, Jackson, during the <i>Survivor</i>

1202
00:53:14,034 --> 00:53:15,137
- casting process...
- Mm-hmm.

1203
00:53:15,172 --> 00:53:17,931
...we spend a lot of time
getting to know players,

1204
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:19,724
- getting to know you, right?
- Right.

1205
00:53:19,758 --> 00:53:20,758
- It's one of the best parts of the job.
- Right.

1206
00:53:20,793 --> 00:53:22,862
From go, you were a home run.

1207
00:53:22,896 --> 00:53:25,793
- It was an absolute "has to be on the show."
- Mm-hmm.

1208
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,655
There's another element

1209
00:53:27,689 --> 00:53:29,655
throughout the casting process
where we ask you

1210
00:53:29,689 --> 00:53:31,655
to always keep us updated
on anything

1211
00:53:31,689 --> 00:53:34,482
that changes
with your medical situation.

1212
00:53:34,517 --> 00:53:36,344
- Right.
- Doctor's visit, anything, and that's because

1213
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,103
we have to make sure
we can take care of you

1214
00:53:39,137 --> 00:53:40,517
when you're out here.

1215
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:41,103
- Right.
- The day before

1216
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:42,482
we're going to shoot,

1217
00:53:42,517 --> 00:53:45,758
you disclose some new
medical information.

1218
00:53:45,793 --> 00:53:51,034
And we all decided, let's
let Jackson start the game.

1219
00:53:51,068 --> 00:53:52,620
- Okay.
- Because nothing's going to happen

1220
00:53:52,655 --> 00:53:54,620
- in 24 or 48 hours.
- Right.

1221
00:53:54,655 --> 00:53:56,620
- So nobody's worried about you at this point.
- Right.

1222
00:53:56,655 --> 00:53:58,620
And everybody,
for the last two days,

1223
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,724
has been trying to figure out
how we can do this.

1224
00:54:00,758 --> 00:54:02,551
But to speak very candidly...

1225
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:04,517
- Please.
- ...it's very hard

1226
00:54:04,551 --> 00:54:06,655
to get any kind
of test done right now.

1227
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:08,655
It's very difficult.

1228
00:54:08,689 --> 00:54:10,896
So here's my question.

1229
00:54:10,931 --> 00:54:12,379
Why did you not tell us?

1230
00:54:12,413 --> 00:54:14,965
Why did you wait
until the last minute?

1231
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,827
'Cause I was trying
to just quit it completely,

1232
00:54:15,862 --> 00:54:17,448
'cause I didn't need it anymore.

1233
00:54:17,482 --> 00:54:19,344
'Cause, I mean, we're talking
to my wife. She's a nurse.

1234
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:21,517
And I said, "I'm on lithium."

1235
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:23,068
And she's like, "Well, you're
weaning yourself off of it.

1236
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:25,034
You'll probably be off of it."

1237
00:54:25,068 --> 00:54:27,344
You're charting it out
and thinking,

1238
00:54:27,379 --> 00:54:29,068
- "I think I can get myself to where I'm off it."
- Yeah.

1239
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:31,068
"I don't need to bring it up
'cause I'll be fine."

1240
00:54:31,103 --> 00:54:33,551
Right, I just thought...
And it's a stigmatism.

1241
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:35,482
I mean, I'm a human
to know the fear is,

1242
00:54:35,517 --> 00:54:38,068
everyone hears the word
"lithium,"

1243
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:40,034
and they go way back in time
where they're like,

1244
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,137
"That was a huge drug
back in the day."

1245
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:43,931
That was a scary drug to be on.

1246
00:54:43,965 --> 00:54:46,827
And the first thought is,
the transition.

1247
00:54:46,862 --> 00:54:48,689
- Right.
- "Was it because of your transition?" I'm like,

1248
00:54:48,724 --> 00:54:50,517
"That had... that had nothing
to do with it."

1249
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:51,827
If that were the case,
I would have been on lithium

1250
00:54:51,862 --> 00:54:54,310
20 years ago
because I was so unhappy,

1251
00:54:54,344 --> 00:54:55,551
- but that wasn't the case.
- Right.

1252
00:54:55,586 --> 00:54:57,862
I took it for another reason.

1253
00:54:57,896 --> 00:54:59,586
And this goes back a few years.

1254
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:03,275
For... When I started
taking care my mom in 2016,

1255
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:05,206
the stress of it...
I wasn't sleeping.

1256
00:55:05,241 --> 00:55:06,931
Like, two hours a night.

1257
00:55:06,965 --> 00:55:08,413
And they're like, "Well,
you have to start sleeping."

1258
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:10,068
So that was a way
for me to take something

1259
00:55:10,103 --> 00:55:12,482
that I could
actually sleep with.

1260
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,965
- Which is not uncommon.
- It wasn't.

1261
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,413
And I wasn't ashamed to say
that I was on something because

1262
00:55:16,448 --> 00:55:17,620
I don't know
how anybody could go through...

1263
00:55:17,655 --> 00:55:19,310
what I went through
and be like,

1264
00:55:19,344 --> 00:55:20,896
"I don't need anything.
I'm fine."

1265
00:55:20,931 --> 00:55:22,793
So, Jackson, I came here

1266
00:55:22,827 --> 00:55:26,448
ready to have this conversation
very veiled,

1267
00:55:26,482 --> 00:55:29,000
without really revealing
anything, out of respect to you.

1268
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,827
- Oh, I appreciate it.
- But you clearly are comfortable

1269
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:35,965
talking about it.
Is that from the same place of,

1270
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,793
"If-if I'm just honest and open,
and if we would just talk more,

1271
00:55:38,827 --> 00:55:41,758
we could... we could get rid
of some of these stigmas?"

1272
00:55:41,793 --> 00:55:43,793
By far. I think you should
talk about everything.

1273
00:55:43,827 --> 00:55:45,931
I'm not ashamed to say

1274
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:48,206
I need help with certain things,
and that's life.

1275
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:50,724
- I mean...
- Okay, so just to be clear,

1276
00:55:50,758 --> 00:55:54,793
the only problem
with this medication is,

1277
00:55:54,827 --> 00:55:57,896
it does have a reaction when
you are stressed, not eating,

1278
00:55:57,931 --> 00:55:59,965
- dehydrated, not sleeping...
- Right.

1279
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,551
...physically demanding
challenges.

1280
00:56:01,586 --> 00:56:04,034
And that's where
our concern came.

1281
00:56:04,068 --> 00:56:06,965
The cumulative effect
of this show would-would have

1282
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,275
a potentially very bad impact
on you, and we don't want that.

1283
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:13,310
Your safety is paramount.

1284
00:56:13,344 --> 00:56:16,482
We can't do it.
We can't.

1285
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah, so...

1286
00:56:21,034 --> 00:56:25,517
I get it, and I appreciate you
talking to me about it.

1287
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:28,379
It's weird that I'm getting
emotional about it, but even

1288
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:30,379
to test yourself for 48 hours,

1289
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:32,758
- it is such an adventure.
- Huh.

1290
00:56:34,344 --> 00:56:36,827
And I take this with love,
and...

1291
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:38,655
I know that I'll be friends
with these people.

1292
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:40,896
And I appreciate you giving me
the opportunity.

1293
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,137
For someone who didn't like
anything about them

1294
00:56:43,172 --> 00:56:48,275
for 40 years,
then to have someone say,

1295
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,172
"People like the things
about you that you didn't know

1296
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:53,103
you were capable of,"
speaks volumes.

1297
00:56:53,137 --> 00:56:55,103
And I appreciate it.

1298
00:56:55,137 --> 00:56:58,379
It was the best 48 hours
I've had ever.

1299
00:56:59,689 --> 00:57:02,034
All right, now the tough part.

1300
00:57:02,068 --> 00:57:03,931
- Yup.
- Have to go tell your tribe.

1301
00:57:03,965 --> 00:57:05,137
Okay.

1302
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:08,931
<i>
Okay.</i>

1303
00:57:08,965 --> 00:57:10,689
We have some news to share.

1304
00:57:10,724 --> 00:57:13,068
Okay, so I've been
on a medication

1305
00:57:13,103 --> 00:57:16,689
since I've been taking care of
mom, uh, for sleep and anxiety.

1306
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:19,724
And unfortunately,
when it comes to that,

1307
00:57:19,758 --> 00:57:22,068
it's dehydration,
a lot of things

1308
00:57:22,103 --> 00:57:24,206
that come along with this can
really mess with the medication

1309
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:25,896
and also make me very sick.

1310
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:29,103
And as much
as I would love to be here...

1311
00:57:29,137 --> 00:57:31,344
No.

1312
00:57:31,379 --> 00:57:34,724
...uh, they're going to have
to take-take me off.

1313
00:57:34,758 --> 00:57:37,206
It's okay.

1314
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:40,862
I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

1315
00:57:40,896 --> 00:57:44,413
I'm so sorry.

1316
00:57:46,655 --> 00:57:48,896
It's so nice to meet you, man.

1317
00:57:48,931 --> 00:57:50,931
Thank you.

1318
00:57:50,965 --> 00:57:52,172
<i>
When you watch the show,</i>

1319
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:55,000
you don't understand
how difficult

1320
00:57:55,034 --> 00:57:57,827
and how important the
survival aspect of this game is.

1321
00:57:57,862 --> 00:58:01,275
<i>It's brutal, and your ability</i> <i>
to survive is reliant</i>

1322
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,793
<i>on the people around you,</i>

1323
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:06,827
<i>and immediately</i> <i>
that bonds you so,</i>

1324
00:58:06,862 --> 00:58:08,620
so, so quickly.

1325
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:10,724
Love you, Jackson!

1326
00:58:17,517 --> 00:58:19,379
<i>
It's a journey that I was</i> <i>
absolutely blessed</i>

1327
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,827
<i>to be able to go on.</i>

1328
00:58:20,862 --> 00:58:22,275
<i>And I think</i>

1329
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:24,724
it makes you stronger
and more adaptable

1330
00:58:24,758 --> 00:58:26,379
to what life will throw at you.

1331
00:58:26,413 --> 00:58:28,482
So I think, even if you don't
win a million dollars,

1332
00:58:28,517 --> 00:58:33,137
you've won something that very
few people can say they've done.

1333
00:58:33,172 --> 00:58:35,517
<i>It was a gift.</i>

1334
00:58:59,896 --> 00:59:02,068
Come on in.

1335
00:59:13,034 --> 00:59:16,896
Vati, Ika, getting your first
look at the new Taku tribe.

1336
00:59:18,206 --> 00:59:19,965
What?
- Huh?

1337
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,448
Jackson had to leave
the game this morning.

1338
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:23,793
What?
Oh.

1339
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:24,655
Oh, wow.

1340
00:59:26,655 --> 00:59:29,931
Just like that, Taku is
down to five tribe members.

1341
00:59:29,965 --> 00:59:31,206
- Oh.
- What?

1342
00:59:33,413 --> 00:59:35,206
All right. Game continues.

1343
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:37,413
Shall we get to our
first immunity challenge?

1344
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,103
- Yes.
- All right.

1345
00:59:39,137 --> 00:59:40,413
For today's challenge,

1346
00:59:40,448 --> 00:59:42,517
<i>each tribe is gonna start out</i>

1347
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:43,896
<i>in the water on a platform.</i>

1348
00:59:43,931 --> 00:59:47,034
<i>On my go,
you'll dive in, swim to a boat,</i>

1349
00:59:47,068 --> 00:59:48,344
<i>paddle to shore,</i>

1350
00:59:48,379 --> 00:59:50,275
<i>collecting three chests</i> <i>
along the way.</i>

1351
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:51,551
<i>Once you get to shore,</i>

1352
00:59:51,586 --> 00:59:54,551
<i>you will drag</i> <i>
your chest and boat</i>

1353
00:59:54,586 --> 00:59:57,068
<i>across the track,</i> <i>
under the net to the finish,</i>

1354
00:59:57,103 --> 01:00:00,413
<i>where two tribe members</i> <i>
will use the pieces inside</i>

1355
01:00:00,448 --> 01:00:02,655
<i>to solve</i> <i>
a massive dragon puzzle.</i>

1356
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:07,551
The first two tribes to finish
win immunity.

1357
01:00:09,758 --> 01:00:11,137
This is what you want.

1358
01:00:12,655 --> 01:00:14,034
Yeah.

1359
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,517
That's cool.

1360
01:00:15,551 --> 01:00:16,965
With the immunity idol
at your camp,

1361
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,724
it means your tribe is safe
and nobody's going home.

1362
01:00:19,758 --> 01:00:21,689
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody

1363
01:00:21,724 --> 01:00:24,379
will be the second person
to leave <i>Survivor 42.</i>

1364
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:27,344
In addition,
there is a penalty for losing.

1365
01:00:27,379 --> 01:00:30,172
The last-place tribe will have
to give me their flint.

1366
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:33,275
Will have a chance to earn it back

1367
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:34,931
at the next immunity challenge.

1368
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,068
Wow.

1369
01:00:37,103 --> 01:00:38,241
All right, one more thing
I have to tell you

1370
01:00:38,275 --> 01:00:39,896
before we get to the sit-outs.

1371
01:00:39,931 --> 01:00:41,517
This we did last season.

1372
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:44,517
Back at camp, you're each gonna
have a die waiting for you.

1373
01:00:44,551 --> 01:00:46,344
It's called
the Shot in the Dark die.

1374
01:00:46,379 --> 01:00:48,103
If you get to Tribal Council
one night,

1375
01:00:48,137 --> 01:00:50,448
and you feel you're in trouble,

1376
01:00:50,482 --> 01:00:52,586
you can choose to not vote

1377
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,551
and instead
play your Shot in the Dark

1378
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:59,206
- for a one-in-six chance at immunity at that Tribal Council.
- Oh.

1379
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:00,310
- Wow.
- Wow.

1380
01:01:00,344 --> 01:01:01,586
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

1381
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,137
- Wow.
- Wow.

1382
01:01:03,172 --> 01:01:04,344
All right, Vati,
you have one extra person.

1383
01:01:04,379 --> 01:01:06,655
Sitting somebody out,
who's it gonna be?

1384
01:01:06,689 --> 01:01:07,862
I'm gonna sit out.

1385
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:09,172
All right, Lydia gonna sit out.

1386
01:01:09,206 --> 01:01:10,586
Ika, who are you gonna sit out?

1387
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,586
I'll do it.

1388
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,034
Romeo's gonna sit out.

1389
01:01:13,068 --> 01:01:14,000
All right.

1390
01:01:14,034 --> 01:01:15,034
Sit-outs, take your spot
on the bench.

1391
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:16,551
Everybody else,
give you a minute to strategize.

1392
01:01:16,586 --> 01:01:18,206
We'll get to
our first immunity challenge.

1393
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,275
All right, here we go.

1394
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,586
For immunity,

1395
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,793
survivors ready.

1396
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:35,931
Go!

1397
01:01:41,068 --> 01:01:45,068
Everybody in the water
got to get to your boat first.

1398
01:01:45,103 --> 01:01:47,931
You got to get
all five tribe members in

1399
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:49,724
before you can detach

1400
01:01:49,758 --> 01:01:52,206
- the boat from its anchor point.
- Got it.

1401
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,517
I'm going to the boat.

1402
01:01:54,551 --> 01:01:56,413
Once again, it is Taku

1403
01:01:56,448 --> 01:01:57,931
quickly out of the gate,
in the lead.

1404
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:59,448
Go.

1405
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,103
Go.
Go.

1406
01:02:01,137 --> 01:02:02,482
- Go.
- Go.

1407
01:02:03,896 --> 01:02:06,137
It's gonna be
Jonathan and Lindsay

1408
01:02:06,172 --> 01:02:08,034
out of the water for Taku,

1409
01:02:08,068 --> 01:02:10,689
trying to untie
that first chest.

1410
01:02:10,724 --> 01:02:13,310
- Wait, wait, wait. Long strokes.
- Vati is way off course.

1411
01:02:13,344 --> 01:02:14,620
They're at the wrong chest.

1412
01:02:14,655 --> 01:02:16,655
They've got to go back.

1413
01:02:16,689 --> 01:02:17,896
Oh!

1414
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:20,517
- You good?
- Good.

1415
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:22,862
These chests are very heavy.

1416
01:02:22,896 --> 01:02:24,241
Jump up.

1417
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:26,137
Vati's at their first chest.

1418
01:02:26,172 --> 01:02:27,862
Ika's at their first chest.

1419
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,689
Those chests weigh a ton.

1420
01:02:32,724 --> 01:02:34,793
Vati has their first chest,
but the boat is gone now.

1421
01:02:38,448 --> 01:02:39,965
Big leap by Jonathan.

1422
01:02:41,172 --> 01:02:42,310
Attagirl!
Wow.

1423
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:45,137
Lindsay with a huge leap.
Taku in the lead.

1424
01:02:45,172 --> 01:02:47,241
Once again, Vati and Ika

1425
01:02:47,275 --> 01:02:49,413
trying to stay in this
first immunity challenge,

1426
01:02:49,448 --> 01:02:51,034
but they are struggling,

1427
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:53,586
trying to figure out
how to paddle together.

1428
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,241
Go. Go.

1429
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:56,689
Taku doing a nice job.

1430
01:02:56,724 --> 01:02:58,517
Very calm.
I got it.

1431
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:01,655
Mike and Hai
on that second chest for Vati.

1432
01:03:01,689 --> 01:03:05,034
Drea and Rocksroy
on that second chest for Ika.

1433
01:03:05,068 --> 01:03:07,241
Jonathan is now realigning Taku,

1434
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:09,206
giving them a head start.

1435
01:03:13,965 --> 01:03:15,827
Rocksroy drops
his chest in the water.

1436
01:03:15,862 --> 01:03:18,241
They're gonna have to now
get it up in their boat,

1437
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:22,344
which makes that leverage
so much more difficult.

1438
01:03:22,379 --> 01:03:25,896
Everybody working now to get that blue chest in there.

1439
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:28,551
They've got it.
Ika's heading out.

1440
01:03:28,586 --> 01:03:30,862
Vati has pulled themselves
back into the challenge,

1441
01:03:30,896 --> 01:03:32,724
if they can get it in there.

1442
01:03:32,758 --> 01:03:35,344
Jonathan's got to be
on that boat, too, and he is.

1443
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:39,000
You got to get to the sand
before you can get out.

1444
01:03:39,034 --> 01:03:41,758
Yes.
Ika working on their third chest.

1445
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,068
You're good!

1446
01:03:44,103 --> 01:03:45,379
It is Taku in the lead.

1447
01:03:45,413 --> 01:03:46,413
I got it. I got it.

1448
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:47,827
Once again.

1449
01:03:47,862 --> 01:03:51,379
Ika struggling now to get
that third chest in there.

1450
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:54,310
It is heavy and there's
not a lot of room.

1451
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:59,241
Now you are dragging a very
heavy boat through the sand...

1452
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:01,965
Go.
All right, we're good.
...with three chests.

1453
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,724
- Ika has struggled this challenge, but you're doing it.
- Keep paddling!

1454
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,448
Keep paddling!

1455
01:04:07,482 --> 01:04:09,413
You guys are doing great!
Ika, you're good.

1456
01:04:09,448 --> 01:04:11,586
Let's carry the chest up.
I can carry...

1457
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,758
All three tribes...
Need help?

1458
01:04:13,793 --> 01:04:15,206
...look to be opting to take

1459
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:17,586
the chests out
and walk them up the beach.

1460
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,827
They are so heavy.

1461
01:04:19,862 --> 01:04:21,758
It's taking everything. Now you
still got to get the boat up.

1462
01:04:23,103 --> 01:04:25,310
That sand has
a lot of resistance.

1463
01:04:25,344 --> 01:04:28,896
You are earning it, every single grunt.

1464
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:35,931
This is no joke.
Nothing is easy on <i>Survivor.</i>

1465
01:04:37,448 --> 01:04:38,482
Slow and steady.

1466
01:04:38,517 --> 01:04:40,931
It is Taku in the lead
once again.

1467
01:04:40,965 --> 01:04:42,827
Here comes Vati.

1468
01:04:42,862 --> 01:04:45,103
- They're making progress.
- One, two, three.

1469
01:04:45,137 --> 01:04:47,034
Now you got to get the chest
back on the boat,

1470
01:04:47,068 --> 01:04:49,310
- 'cause everything's got to go together through the net.
- Yeah.

1471
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,310
Take a breath,

1472
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,413
take a breath, take a breath.

1473
01:04:51,448 --> 01:04:54,034
You can see
the exhaustion on everybody.

1474
01:04:54,068 --> 01:04:56,000
All right. Go.

1475
01:04:56,034 --> 01:04:57,620
Ika's still at the beginning
of the track.

1476
01:04:57,655 --> 01:04:59,448
You've got this, guys!
Here we go! Come on!

1477
01:04:59,482 --> 01:05:01,344
Very little left in the tank.
Go, let's go!

1478
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:03,206
We're only on day three.

1479
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:07,034
Here goes Taku with the next difficult section.

1480
01:05:07,068 --> 01:05:08,655
This is not easy either.

1481
01:05:08,689 --> 01:05:10,896
Go, let's go! Three.

1482
01:05:14,172 --> 01:05:15,517
Two, three.

1483
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:18,172
There goes Vati.

1484
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,137
They've got some momentum now.

1485
01:05:20,172 --> 01:05:22,034
Yeah! Come on, you guys
are in this! Let's go!

1486
01:05:22,068 --> 01:05:24,034
They're starting to gain
on Taku.

1487
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:26,862
They have got
a very fast pace now.

1488
01:05:26,896 --> 01:05:29,310
It is now Vati in the lead.

1489
01:05:31,482 --> 01:05:33,137
Ika trying to get back in it.

1490
01:05:33,172 --> 01:05:34,137
Get it up there.

1491
01:05:34,172 --> 01:05:35,310
Let's go!

1492
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:38,172
Everybody, pick up the back.

1493
01:05:38,206 --> 01:05:40,137
One, two, three.

1494
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,793
It's outside the net.
One, two, three, push.

1495
01:05:44,827 --> 01:05:46,517
Vati in the lead.
One, two, three, push.

1496
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:47,862
Yes, keep digging deep!
Guys, the end is in sight.

1497
01:05:47,896 --> 01:05:51,206
Taku still trying to figure
this part of it out.

1498
01:05:51,241 --> 01:05:53,000
They're running out of steam.

1499
01:05:53,034 --> 01:05:55,827
- You got to get to the end, Vati.
- One, two, three.

1500
01:05:55,862 --> 01:05:57,655
Yeah!
Vati, you're good!

1501
01:05:57,689 --> 01:06:00,172
Now you're putting the chests in the spots.
Come on! We've got it!

1502
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,379
Come on, let's go!

1503
01:06:01,413 --> 01:06:02,896
Yes! You got it!

1504
01:06:02,931 --> 01:06:04,655
Ika, pushing through
that net now.

1505
01:06:07,758 --> 01:06:09,793
Taku digging to stay in this.

1506
01:06:09,827 --> 01:06:11,862
Vati has their third chest.
Go. Go. Go, go, go.

1507
01:06:11,896 --> 01:06:13,551
Now the puzzle solvers take
over.

1508
01:06:13,586 --> 01:06:15,034
Two people.
It's gonna be Daniel and Jenny.

1509
01:06:15,068 --> 01:06:16,517
Y'all got this.

1510
01:06:16,551 --> 01:06:17,448
You get 'em out.
I'll start working.

1511
01:06:17,482 --> 01:06:20,034
Three.

1512
01:06:20,068 --> 01:06:23,068
This challenge
is taking everything you have.

1513
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,724
Rocksroy absolutely exhausted.

1514
01:06:25,758 --> 01:06:27,965
Complete fatigue.

1515
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,344
Taku, three more feet. Let's go.

1516
01:06:30,379 --> 01:06:31,448
Come on!

1517
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:40,620
There it is. You're good, Taku!

1518
01:06:40,655 --> 01:06:43,103
Now you can move your chests
up onto the platform.

1519
01:06:43,137 --> 01:06:44,965
Take this side
and pull it toward me. Okay.

1520
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,758
Jonathan gonna do it himself,
carrying the first one.

1521
01:06:46,793 --> 01:06:49,413
That's it, right?
Vati with a lot of time.

1522
01:06:49,448 --> 01:06:52,068
Here comes Ika, still slowly inching their way there.
One, two, three.

1523
01:06:54,068 --> 01:06:56,965
Vati has that first section
of puzzle completed.

1524
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,517
- Exactly. Like that.
- Yeah.

1525
01:06:58,551 --> 01:07:00,172
Remember, I'll do the left side,
you're gonna do the right.

1526
01:07:00,206 --> 01:07:03,310
Vati, now onto the second
chest of puzzle pieces

1527
01:07:03,344 --> 01:07:06,275
- with a huge lead right now.
- Oh!
- We're good. We're good.

1528
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:08,310
Two puzzle solvers now.
It's gonna be Maryanne and Omar.

1529
01:07:08,344 --> 01:07:10,137
Ready? One, two...

1530
01:07:10,172 --> 01:07:12,344
Now have two tribes
on the puzzle.

1531
01:07:12,379 --> 01:07:14,275
That's the one right below you.

1532
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:15,655
It's Taku and Vati.

1533
01:07:15,689 --> 01:07:18,034
Vati's had a big lead
on this puzzle.

1534
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:20,172
Daniel and Jenny have been
working very well together.

1535
01:07:20,206 --> 01:07:21,172
Great. We're good.

1536
01:07:21,206 --> 01:07:22,965
Hey! Another piece.

1537
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,241
Taku quickly gaining on Vati.

1538
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,965
They're through
the first section.

1539
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,758
They're now on
their second chest of pieces.

1540
01:07:29,793 --> 01:07:31,034
We got a challenge now.

1541
01:07:33,103 --> 01:07:36,137
- There you go. That's how you do it, Ika.
- One, two, three.

1542
01:07:36,172 --> 01:07:37,689
Yeah!

1543
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:39,620
One, two, three.
They're two feet away,

1544
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,931
but you got to finish
those two feet.

1545
01:07:41,965 --> 01:07:43,862
You're good! Start moving the chests now to the platform.
Go, go, go.

1546
01:07:43,896 --> 01:07:45,655
Come on, guys.

1547
01:07:45,689 --> 01:07:48,172
Yes. Nice.
It is Taku and Vati side by side

1548
01:07:48,206 --> 01:07:50,758
at about the same spot.
Yes, Jenny! Yes, Jenny!

1549
01:07:50,793 --> 01:07:52,758
Move!

1550
01:07:52,793 --> 01:07:54,965
Zach getting shoved out of the
way. All right, puzzle solvers,

1551
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,482
take over.
Other three, on your mat.

1552
01:07:56,517 --> 01:07:57,517
Let's go, guys.
Let's go, Z!

1553
01:07:57,551 --> 01:07:59,344
Comeback story.

1554
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:01,241
Go!
Yes, Jenny! Yes! Yes!
One of the most

1555
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:04,724
- physically grueling challenges we've ever done.
- Yes, Jenny.

1556
01:08:04,758 --> 01:08:08,586
- But all three tribes completed the physical...
- Keep going!

1557
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,896
- You've got it!
- ...the punishing part.

1558
01:08:09,931 --> 01:08:13,310
Now comes the smarts,
the puzzle solvers.

1559
01:08:13,344 --> 01:08:14,827
Good job, guys.

1560
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:17,034
Swati and Zach
are making up some time

1561
01:08:17,068 --> 01:08:19,379
with their last two pieces.
There they are.

1562
01:08:19,413 --> 01:08:21,551
- Let's go! We've got to go!
- Now you can move on to that second chest.

1563
01:08:21,586 --> 01:08:23,379
We're right there!

1564
01:08:23,413 --> 01:08:26,172
It is Taku and Vati. Very close.

1565
01:08:26,206 --> 01:08:29,379
Can Ika catch
either one of them?

1566
01:08:29,413 --> 01:08:31,482
Otherwise, Ika going
to Tribal Council

1567
01:08:31,517 --> 01:08:33,689
and somebody will be
voted out of this game tonight.

1568
01:08:34,931 --> 01:08:37,620
And she's got it. They can
move on to their third chest.

1569
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:38,793
Come on, Jenny!

1570
01:08:38,827 --> 01:08:40,310
You're almost done!

1571
01:08:40,344 --> 01:08:41,172
You're good, Taku. Go.

1572
01:08:42,379 --> 01:08:44,275
Taku now onto their third chest.

1573
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:45,931
- Let's go! We're right there!
- We got to dig!

1574
01:08:45,965 --> 01:08:49,034
Zach and Swati
are working independently.

1575
01:08:49,068 --> 01:08:50,344
We're gaining!

1576
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:51,482
You don't need to win,
you just don't want to be last.

1577
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:54,448
Please, guys,
let's go, let's go!

1578
01:08:54,482 --> 01:08:57,689
There goes Jenny with a piece and another piece.
Yes, Jenny!

1579
01:08:57,724 --> 01:09:00,275
Omar looking to close it out for Taku.
Nice. Great job.

1580
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,655
Swati, this one
should go there.

1581
01:09:04,517 --> 01:09:06,862
This one.

1582
01:09:06,896 --> 01:09:08,655
Ika now hitting
their own roadblock.

1583
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:10,310
That one, that one, that one.

1584
01:09:10,344 --> 01:09:13,793
Omar and Maryanne can smell
victory. Is this the last piece?

1585
01:09:17,448 --> 01:09:19,344
Jeff, do we have it?
We got it.
- Taku...

1586
01:09:19,379 --> 01:09:21,620
has it! Taku wins immunity!

1587
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:27,172
Keep going! Keep going!

1588
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:30,103
Big celebration. We're still
looking for one more.

1589
01:09:30,137 --> 01:09:32,344
Jenny down to three pieces left.

1590
01:09:32,379 --> 01:09:33,758
Don't knock it down.
Be careful.

1591
01:09:33,793 --> 01:09:35,241
Come on! Theirs could fall out!

1592
01:09:35,275 --> 01:09:36,620
You can put this one
in the Deepfreeze.

1593
01:09:36,655 --> 01:09:38,413
Ika is in trouble.

1594
01:09:38,448 --> 01:09:41,068
Vati one piece away.
Don't hit it out.

1595
01:09:41,103 --> 01:09:42,827
Jenny has it. Got to get it in.
Careful on that last one.

1596
01:09:42,862 --> 01:09:44,827
Okay.

1597
01:09:44,862 --> 01:09:47,758
And there it is. Vati wins immunity!

1598
01:09:47,793 --> 01:09:49,275
They are safe
from Tribal Council,

1599
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,620
sending Ika

1600
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:55,034
to the first Tribal Council
of <i>Survivor 42.</i>

1601
01:10:00,551 --> 01:10:03,310
That is one of the most
grueling challenges.

1602
01:10:03,344 --> 01:10:05,862
There is no doubt you earned it.

1603
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:10,172
Result is, Taku, immunity.

1604
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,517
Lost one person.
You're not losing anybody else.

1605
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:15,689
Everyone touch it.
Everyone touch it.

1606
01:10:15,724 --> 01:10:18,103
Vati, nobody going home
from your tribe.

1607
01:10:18,137 --> 01:10:19,103
Jenny, go get it.

1608
01:10:19,137 --> 01:10:20,517
Well earned, Jenny. Nice job.

1609
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:22,172
- Thank you, Jeff.
- Jenny on the block.

1610
01:10:22,206 --> 01:10:23,482
All right, Vati,

1611
01:10:23,517 --> 01:10:25,862
Taku, head back to camp.
No Tribal Council.

1612
01:10:25,896 --> 01:10:27,586
Nobody going home.
Enjoy the night off.

1613
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,448
Yeah.

1614
01:10:29,482 --> 01:10:32,000
All right, Ika.
Tribal Council tonight.

1615
01:10:32,034 --> 01:10:34,655
There's also
the punishment of losing.

1616
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:36,172
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
- Got to give me your flint.

1617
01:10:36,206 --> 01:10:38,310
- It's okay.
- Thanks, Romeo.

1618
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:40,862
Sorry for you.

1619
01:10:40,896 --> 01:10:42,517
- Are you?
- We'll get that back.

1620
01:10:42,551 --> 01:10:43,965
You'll have a chance
to earn it back

1621
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,275
at the next immunity challenge.

1622
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:47,655
All right, Ika,
see you tonight where somebody

1623
01:10:47,689 --> 01:10:50,758
will be the second person
to leave <i>Survivor 42.</i>

1624
01:10:50,793 --> 01:10:53,034
<i>I know that the puzzles</i> <i>
are a place</i>

1625
01:10:53,068 --> 01:10:54,689
<i>that I can prove myself,</i>

1626
01:10:54,724 --> 01:10:57,655
but I've never been more
exhausted in my entire life.

1627
01:10:57,689 --> 01:10:59,862
<i>And at that point,</i> <i>
everything that you memorize</i>

1628
01:10:59,896 --> 01:11:02,758
<i>about a specific puzzle</i> <i>
just goes out of the window.</i>

1629
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:04,586
<i>So the fact that we lost,</i>

1630
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,551
honestly, I-I put 100%
of the blame on myself.

1631
01:11:18,689 --> 01:11:20,172
Um, I just want to apologize.

1632
01:11:20,206 --> 01:11:21,034
- For what?
- For the puzzle.

1633
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,034
For the puzzle.

1634
01:11:22,068 --> 01:11:24,068
There are no excuses.

1635
01:11:24,103 --> 01:11:26,103
We win is a team,
we lose as a team.

1636
01:11:26,137 --> 01:11:27,344
That's how I look at it.
Mm-hmm.

1637
01:11:27,379 --> 01:11:31,413
I-I just appreciate you so much,
just saying that.

1638
01:11:31,448 --> 01:11:35,103
And I just want to thank you all
for that.

1639
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:36,965
Can I say something first,
before we all do split up?

1640
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,448
Yeah.
- Just because,

1641
01:11:38,482 --> 01:11:39,448
whether we like it or not,

1642
01:11:39,482 --> 01:11:40,931
we do have to make
a big decision tonight.

1643
01:11:40,965 --> 01:11:41,965
And I know that

1644
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,448
talk of idols will play
into that decision.

1645
01:11:44,482 --> 01:11:46,517
So I just want to talk
to you guys

1646
01:11:46,551 --> 01:11:49,827
as all rational,
logical, intelligent people.

1647
01:11:49,862 --> 01:11:52,068
I know there's been a rumor
that I have an idol.

1648
01:11:52,103 --> 01:11:54,034
So, like, I don't want that
to have to

1649
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:55,034
factor into our decision, okay?

1650
01:11:55,068 --> 01:11:56,793
Like, I don't have it,

1651
01:11:56,827 --> 01:11:58,862
so that doesn't need to be
something we, like, work around.

1652
01:12:00,172 --> 01:12:02,482
<i>I have to really quickly dispel</i>

1653
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:04,413
that paranoia behind me
having an idol,

1654
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:07,137
because if that's
what takes me out,

1655
01:12:07,172 --> 01:12:08,724
that's honestly stupid.

1656
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:10,068
But I did want to talk to you
one-on-one,

1657
01:12:10,103 --> 01:12:11,586
just, like, woman-to-woman,
'cause I did hear

1658
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,586
that the idol rumor
came from you, so...

1659
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,241
Other people
were also getting in my head

1660
01:12:15,275 --> 01:12:16,551
that you were out
there looking for it.

1661
01:12:16,586 --> 01:12:18,000
But then... Oh.

1662
01:12:21,413 --> 01:12:22,896
Can someone fess up

1663
01:12:22,931 --> 01:12:26,724
and tell us who told her that?

1664
01:12:26,758 --> 01:12:28,758
Just to clear the air,

1665
01:12:28,793 --> 01:12:30,344
'cause now we're all
gonna have paranoia.

1666
01:12:31,965 --> 01:12:33,137
<i>
It really was me.</i>

1667
01:12:33,172 --> 01:12:35,034
<i>Like, I was the one</i> <i>
who ran down to tell her.</i>

1668
01:12:35,068 --> 01:12:36,862
<i>All I'm thinking to myself is,</i>

1669
01:12:36,896 --> 01:12:39,896
"Oh, Tori's throwing me
under the bus. Cool."

1670
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:43,137
<i>Uh, so I know that I'm gonna be</i> <i>
in trouble tonight.</i>

1671
01:12:43,172 --> 01:12:45,034
There was never a rumor
that you had an idol.

1672
01:12:45,068 --> 01:12:46,482
- Okay, yay.
- There's only a rumor that you were looking for it.

1673
01:12:46,517 --> 01:12:48,379
- Okay, yeah.
- And that's when...

1674
01:12:48,413 --> 01:12:50,034
- Just to talk about the challenge...
- Mm-hmm.

1675
01:12:50,068 --> 01:12:51,827
At one point,

1676
01:12:51,862 --> 01:12:54,862
I was looking
at both Zach and Rocks.

1677
01:12:54,896 --> 01:12:58,517
It was only me
pulling at the front.

1678
01:12:58,551 --> 01:13:01,103
- Rocks kept on saying "stop" because he was tired.
- Mm-hmm.

1679
01:13:01,137 --> 01:13:02,827
I was literally in the water

1680
01:13:02,862 --> 01:13:05,793
having to pull it,
like, push it up.

1681
01:13:05,827 --> 01:13:07,586
- Yeah, you were freaking killing it.
- And I just feel like

1682
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,793
- he's not contributing at all.
- Mm-hmm.

1683
01:13:10,827 --> 01:13:12,655
Thank you, Rocks, for helping
build our shelter and fire,

1684
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:14,310
and now we can take it
from here.

1685
01:13:14,344 --> 01:13:16,068
- I did the fire.
- Yeah, true, you did.

1686
01:13:16,103 --> 01:13:17,655
You made the fire. Yeah.

1687
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:20,379
<i>Drea comes up with this idea</i> <i>
of getting out Rocks.</i>

1688
01:13:20,413 --> 01:13:22,965
<i>It's a really good idea because</i> <i>
he helped us with the shelter.</i>

1689
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,275
We don't need him anymore.

1690
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,379
Let's get Rocks out.

1691
01:13:25,413 --> 01:13:26,931
Yes. Rocks is out.

1692
01:13:26,965 --> 01:13:27,758
Yeah.

1693
01:13:30,793 --> 01:13:33,586
- You need to wash those off.
- What?

1694
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,137
Those things
that you call shoes.

1695
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:41,310
Anything that is not me tonight,

1696
01:13:41,344 --> 01:13:43,793
'cause I know that, like,
Zach and I did the puzzle,

1697
01:13:43,827 --> 01:13:46,137
so Zach and I have a little bit
more of a target on our backs.

1698
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,137
I want to know
who would you want to.

1699
01:13:49,413 --> 01:13:53,068
I would still feel...
better getting Zach out.

1700
01:13:53,103 --> 01:13:54,206
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1701
01:13:54,241 --> 01:13:55,103
<i>I was pushing for Zach</i>

1702
01:13:55,137 --> 01:13:57,275
<i>to go home because</i>

1703
01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:59,034
my puzzle partner Zach

1704
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:02,103
was one-- slower at the puzzle
than me, even though

1705
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:04,620
<i>he was supposed</i> <i>
to be our main puzzle person.</i>

1706
01:14:04,655 --> 01:14:07,689
<i>And then, two-- just kind of</i> <i>
gave up during the challenge.</i>

1707
01:14:07,724 --> 01:14:09,310
<i>Don't overthink yourself.</i> <i>
Okay.</i>

1708
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:10,517
- You made a decision.
- Okay.

1709
01:14:10,551 --> 01:14:11,689
- Stick with your decision.
- Okay.

1710
01:14:11,724 --> 01:14:12,965
- And that's it.
- Sounds good.

1711
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,379
<i>
I don't want this whole</i>

1712
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:16,724
buzzing around,
boom, boom, boom at Tribal. No.

1713
01:14:16,758 --> 01:14:18,862
Okay.

1714
01:14:18,896 --> 01:14:20,827
<i>
There is a weak link,</i> <i>
and that weak link is Zach.</i>

1715
01:14:20,862 --> 01:14:22,551
<i>We have a plan.</i>

1716
01:14:22,586 --> 01:14:24,827
Stick with the plan
and be done.

1717
01:14:24,862 --> 01:14:26,896
My gut is telling me
Rocks needs to go.

1718
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:31,275
Rocks did nothing.

1719
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:33,103
I did the brunt of the work.

1720
01:14:33,137 --> 01:14:35,862
The problem is that, first
of all, we can't do him now.

1721
01:14:35,896 --> 01:14:38,655
We have to do him now.
My plan is to do him now.

1722
01:14:38,689 --> 01:14:40,655
- Just hear me out here.
- Yeah.

1723
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,965
<i>
Drea, we made an-an alliance</i>

1724
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,862
on day one-- the three of us.
What do you mean-- Rocks?

1725
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:46,482
Number one--
he's our strongest guy.

1726
01:14:46,517 --> 01:14:48,551
<i>We need him in challenges.</i>

1727
01:14:48,586 --> 01:14:50,827
<i>Number two--</i> <i>
he's in our alliance.</i>

1728
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:52,344
Just for strength alone.

1729
01:14:52,379 --> 01:14:54,586
Fine. I'll do what you say.

1730
01:14:56,206 --> 01:14:58,758
I think this time-- Tori.

1731
01:15:00,137 --> 01:15:02,689
<i>
I was pushing for Rocks, but</i>

1732
01:15:02,724 --> 01:15:04,034
<i>I realized,</i> <i>
after talking to Romeo,</i>

1733
01:15:04,068 --> 01:15:05,586
<i>I have to go with the numbers.</i>

1734
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,448
<i>'Cause yesterday I took the risk</i> <i>
to lose my vote,</i>

1735
01:15:08,482 --> 01:15:10,758
and I will only know
in Tribal, when I go to vote,

1736
01:15:10,793 --> 01:15:13,275
if I have my vote
or if I've lost my vote.

1737
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:15,586
<i>So, I will vote Tori</i> <i>
if that's where it's going.</i>

1738
01:15:20,793 --> 01:15:22,034
I think, you know,
we all... we all know

1739
01:15:22,068 --> 01:15:23,724
what's going on here, so..

1740
01:15:23,758 --> 01:15:25,448
- Yeah...
- Um, I think... I think

1741
01:15:25,482 --> 01:15:29,034
it could be either one of us,
but... I don't know.

1742
01:15:29,068 --> 01:15:31,724
<i>I've always kind of been someone</i> <i>
who, like,</i>

1743
01:15:31,758 --> 01:15:33,862
always kind of looks
at the worst-case scenarios.

1744
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,862
<i>Either everyone's voting</i> <i>
for Tori,</i>

1745
01:15:35,896 --> 01:15:37,689
<i>or people are voting for me.</i>

1746
01:15:37,724 --> 01:15:39,724
I just wanted to say,
like, whatever happens,

1747
01:15:39,758 --> 01:15:41,896
- no hard feelings.
- Yeah. Okay.

1748
01:15:41,931 --> 01:15:44,068
<i>
I just hope</i> <i>
that they really do see</i>

1749
01:15:44,103 --> 01:15:46,344
<i>how much</i> <i>
Tori has been plotting</i>

1750
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:48,137
<i>and going off</i> <i>
to look for the idol.</i>

1751
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:52,517
<i>
That's the only hope I have,</i>

1752
01:15:52,551 --> 01:15:54,241
<i>other than the Shot in the Dark.</i>

1753
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:55,586
<i>
Zach.</i>

1754
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,103
So it's between Zach and Tori.

1755
01:15:58,413 --> 01:16:00,620
And...

1756
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,448
<i>
This one's a hard one for me</i>

1757
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:11,655
<i>because Zach is my plan B.</i>

1758
01:16:11,689 --> 01:16:14,413
<i>We have the skinny guys
alliance, and I trust the kid.</i>

1759
01:16:14,448 --> 01:16:15,827
<i>And getting rid</i>

1760
01:16:15,862 --> 01:16:18,448
of Zach would not make sense
for me.

1761
01:16:18,482 --> 01:16:21,827
<i>So I want Tori</i> <i>
because she's sneaky.</i>

1762
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:22,862
What name are you going
to write down?

1763
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:27,344
No, I'm not...
I'm not doing that.

1764
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:29,103
<i>
But unfortunately,</i> <i>
Rocks and Swati--</i>

1765
01:16:29,137 --> 01:16:31,482
<i>they want to keep strength.</i>

1766
01:16:31,517 --> 01:16:33,275
I want to keep somebody
that I trust.

1767
01:16:36,965 --> 01:16:39,000
<i>But this is</i> Survivor <i>2.0.</i>

1768
01:16:39,034 --> 01:16:40,517
<i>This is what I signed up for.</i>

1769
01:17:04,344 --> 01:17:07,586
Behind each of you is a torch.
Go ahead and grab a torch,

1770
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:10,689
approach the flame,
dip it in and get fire.

1771
01:17:23,517 --> 01:17:25,689
Zach, I know you want to say it.
Go ahead.

1772
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,586
In this game,
fire represents your life.

1773
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,344
Once your fire is gone,

1774
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:33,551
so are you.
Well done.

1775
01:17:33,586 --> 01:17:36,034
That's what we say
to begin Tribal Council,

1776
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:37,758
only to remind you

1777
01:17:37,793 --> 01:17:40,482
that that flame is literally
your life in the game,

1778
01:17:40,517 --> 01:17:41,896
and there are six flames.

1779
01:17:41,931 --> 01:17:43,344
Shortly,
there will only be five.

1780
01:17:43,379 --> 01:17:46,482
So, Rocksroy, it's one thing
to watch the show.

1781
01:17:46,517 --> 01:17:48,103
It's another to go camping.

1782
01:17:48,137 --> 01:17:51,172
But to get out here and
actually be physically living

1783
01:17:51,206 --> 01:17:53,172
in a real jungle--
what's it been like?

1784
01:17:53,206 --> 01:17:55,103
It's been... it's been tough.

1785
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:56,689
And when you told us
that we will not

1786
01:17:56,724 --> 01:17:58,000
be receiving any rice--

1787
01:17:58,034 --> 01:18:01,965
I think all of us,
collectively, was like, "What?!"

1788
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,620
And from watching a lot
of <i>Survivor</i>

1789
01:18:03,655 --> 01:18:05,241
and then survival shows,

1790
01:18:05,275 --> 01:18:09,827
I could 100% say,
"America, this show is real."

1791
01:18:09,862 --> 01:18:12,620
Zach, how about for you?
I know you've dreamed

1792
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:14,344
of being on <i>Survivor,</i>
and now here you are.

1793
01:18:14,379 --> 01:18:15,827
You're living out in the jungle.

1794
01:18:15,862 --> 01:18:18,000
The first thing
I'm thinking of is, you know,

1795
01:18:18,034 --> 01:18:20,103
watching the show, when
the shelter's getting built,

1796
01:18:20,137 --> 01:18:22,000
you get-- what-- like,
a minute-30 long montage?

1797
01:18:23,827 --> 01:18:25,379
So I'm sitting there
waiting, like,

1798
01:18:25,413 --> 01:18:27,517
"When does the montage start?
When are we going

1799
01:18:27,551 --> 01:18:29,344
to get through this stuff?"
But instead

1800
01:18:29,379 --> 01:18:32,275
I was able to really go to work
on the shelter, and I feel like

1801
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:35,517
every single person here pulled
their weight and made it happen.

1802
01:18:35,551 --> 01:18:38,034
So, Drea,

1803
01:18:38,068 --> 01:18:40,103
we're in the early stage
of the game.

1804
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:42,482
And of course, you want to build
your own individual game,

1805
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:45,000
which is making alliances
and relationships.

1806
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:47,344
But you do have to have
a strong tribe,

1807
01:18:47,379 --> 01:18:49,620
because if you don't have
a strong tribe,

1808
01:18:49,655 --> 01:18:51,620
you end up at Tribal Council
where there's nowhere to hide.

1809
01:18:51,655 --> 01:18:55,620
I truly believe that this is
going to be a very hard season.

1810
01:18:55,655 --> 01:18:57,965
We're continuously improving
the camp

1811
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,413
while trying to find food.

1812
01:19:00,448 --> 01:19:01,862
- Right.
- And then you're like,

1813
01:19:01,896 --> 01:19:04,620
"Oh, and we lost
the challenge today.

1814
01:19:04,655 --> 01:19:06,793
We have to get someone out."
So, for me,

1815
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:08,448
I do think you need
to have a strong tribe.

1816
01:19:08,482 --> 01:19:11,758
So, did Shot in the Dark
come up, Romeo?

1817
01:19:11,793 --> 01:19:15,517
I mean, I think every individual
here looks at it differently.

1818
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:18,931
If you feel desperate
tonight, use it.

1819
01:19:18,965 --> 01:19:21,344
If you don't, don't use it.
It's early in the game.

1820
01:19:21,379 --> 01:19:23,724
I think it's an individual
decision, but nobody said

1821
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:25,379
if they were using it or not.

1822
01:19:25,413 --> 01:19:27,034
Swati, you nervous?
Yes.

1823
01:19:27,068 --> 01:19:28,517
If I could cut off a finger

1824
01:19:28,551 --> 01:19:29,965
to not be
at Tribal tonight, I would.

1825
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,586
I just, like,
don't want to be here.

1826
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:34,034
You would give up your pinkie...
Yeah.

1827
01:19:34,068 --> 01:19:35,793
...for the rest of your life

1828
01:19:35,827 --> 01:19:38,275
- to survive one Tribal?
- Yes. Yes.  Oh.

1829
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:39,586
And if you came back
next Tribal,

1830
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,931
and I said, "The other pinkie"?

1831
01:19:40,965 --> 01:19:42,517
- Ooh.
- Oh.

1832
01:19:42,551 --> 01:19:46,034
I think past, like,
day seven or eight,

1833
01:19:46,068 --> 01:19:47,344
I would stop giving up
a finger.

1834
01:19:47,379 --> 01:19:48,758
All right, so, two digits?

1835
01:19:48,793 --> 01:19:50,724
You know, it's not that weird.
I mean...

1836
01:19:52,206 --> 01:19:54,448
Zach, how about for you?

1837
01:19:54,482 --> 01:19:57,103
I definitely feel
very nervous tonight.

1838
01:19:57,137 --> 01:20:00,103
I know that my name has been
thrown out there, so

1839
01:20:00,137 --> 01:20:04,586
I-I would be really surprised
if it wasn't me and Tori.

1840
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:07,206
One of us.
Tori, you're nodding.

1841
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:08,413
You agree with that?
I know

1842
01:20:08,448 --> 01:20:09,862
that I'm on the chopping block,

1843
01:20:09,896 --> 01:20:11,275
which is literally terrifying.

1844
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:13,931
I wanted to throw up
when I just said that, but

1845
01:20:13,965 --> 01:20:15,103
I believe
that I am a strong player,

1846
01:20:15,137 --> 01:20:17,034
and so, if you keep me in this,

1847
01:20:17,068 --> 01:20:18,206
you're going to keep us strong,

1848
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:20,344
and the people I've been
working with in an alliance

1849
01:20:20,379 --> 01:20:21,620
are going to keep me around.

1850
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:23,655
And I am a trustworthy,
loyal person.

1851
01:20:23,689 --> 01:20:25,344
I haven't been able
to prove that to you yet,

1852
01:20:25,379 --> 01:20:27,586
but I will be able to tonight.
Well, I...

1853
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:30,379
I don't know. The trustworthy
and loyal is just the...

1854
01:20:30,413 --> 01:20:32,482
that part that I get
caught up on, you know.

1855
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:34,482
'Cause obviously we've had
a little bit of differences

1856
01:20:34,517 --> 01:20:35,896
when it comes to, like,

1857
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,586
where we started the game
and where we are now.

1858
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:41,586
And I mean, I still...
I still really like Tori.

1859
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,517
- Um...
- Doesn't want to work with me anymore, though.

1860
01:20:43,551 --> 01:20:45,137
I do not want
to work with her...

1861
01:20:45,172 --> 01:20:46,448
Well, and her body language
just shifted

1862
01:20:46,482 --> 01:20:50,068
very clearly when you started
leaning in. She's closed off.

1863
01:20:50,103 --> 01:20:53,068
I know that Tori went
to Drea and, like,

1864
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:55,620
you know, tried
to throw me under the bus,

1865
01:20:55,655 --> 01:20:57,758
and that's kind of
how the whole day started.

1866
01:20:57,793 --> 01:20:59,724
Wow. That's crazy. I'm, like,

1867
01:20:59,758 --> 01:21:02,758
so mentally,
I guess, fatigued that

1868
01:21:02,793 --> 01:21:04,275
I don't remember that happening.

1869
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:06,793
- Now, are you being sarcastic?
- Absolutely, yes.

1870
01:21:06,827 --> 01:21:08,068
You're saying that did not happen?
Yeah.

1871
01:21:08,103 --> 01:21:09,689
It didn't happen.
Just to go to all of this,

1872
01:21:09,724 --> 01:21:12,482
the only reason I'm even
being mentioned now is because

1873
01:21:12,517 --> 01:21:16,034
I was foraging for food
for literally ten minutes

1874
01:21:16,068 --> 01:21:18,413
by myself, which is a mistake.

1875
01:21:18,448 --> 01:21:20,517
And then I come back,
and, you know, of course

1876
01:21:20,551 --> 01:21:21,965
there's going to be a talk
because in this game,

1877
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,758
when you have not solidified
trust or alliances,

1878
01:21:23,793 --> 01:21:27,620
you are looking for any
single thing that you can find

1879
01:21:27,655 --> 01:21:29,758
to pit someone against another,

1880
01:21:29,793 --> 01:21:32,034
or to say "Ooh,
maybe we shouldn't trust them."

1881
01:21:32,068 --> 01:21:33,241
And I got caught
in the crossfire,

1882
01:21:33,275 --> 01:21:34,448
and that's why I'm here.

1883
01:21:34,482 --> 01:21:36,551
That is why
my name got brought up.

1884
01:21:38,241 --> 01:21:42,344
All right, it is time to vote.
Zach, you're up.

1885
01:21:48,724 --> 01:21:51,862
First vote of season 42.

1886
01:21:51,896 --> 01:21:53,517
It's not even a vote.

1887
01:22:41,379 --> 01:22:44,137
Anybody has an advantage or an
idol, and you want to play it,

1888
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:45,620
now would be the time to do so.

1889
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:49,517
Yup.

1890
01:22:49,551 --> 01:22:51,517
I'll take the shot.
So, Zach,

1891
01:22:51,551 --> 01:22:53,034
you took the Shot in the Dark?

1892
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:54,965
- Yeah, I took the Shot in the Dark.
- Okay.

1893
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,241
As a superfan, I know

1894
01:22:56,275 --> 01:22:58,172
that if you've got whatever odds

1895
01:22:58,206 --> 01:22:59,586
there are that you're safe,

1896
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:02,517
and you can add 16%
to those odds,

1897
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:05,172
I think
you'd be silly not to take it.

1898
01:23:05,206 --> 01:23:07,310
So Zach sacrificed his vote.

1899
01:23:07,344 --> 01:23:09,310
So there is not a vote
in here from Zach.

1900
01:23:09,344 --> 01:23:13,241
Instead, took a one-in-six shot
at safety in the game.

1901
01:23:13,275 --> 01:23:14,931
If that says you're safe,

1902
01:23:14,965 --> 01:23:17,655
then any votes in here
that are for you will not count.

1903
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:20,034
If you're not safe,
any votes will count.

1904
01:23:20,068 --> 01:23:22,344
All right,
you're gonna open it

1905
01:23:22,379 --> 01:23:23,724
and then show it
to all of us.

1906
01:23:25,068 --> 01:23:26,758
Let's see.

1907
01:23:31,068 --> 01:23:32,413
"Not safe."

1908
01:23:34,517 --> 01:23:36,586
Not safe.

1909
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:40,172
All right. Any votes cast
for Zach will still count.

1910
01:23:40,206 --> 01:23:42,379
I'll read the votes.

1911
01:23:45,034 --> 01:23:47,931
First vote-- Zach.

1912
01:23:52,551 --> 01:23:55,344
Zach. Two votes-- Zach.

1913
01:23:58,965 --> 01:24:02,310
Second person voted out
of <i>Survivor 42--</i> Zach.

1914
01:24:02,344 --> 01:24:05,241
That's three. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

1915
01:24:13,517 --> 01:24:16,137
Zach, the tribe has spoken.

1916
01:24:16,172 --> 01:24:18,103
Bye, Zach.

1917
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:20,206
- Time for you to go.
- I really did have a blast.

1918
01:24:20,241 --> 01:24:21,896
Seriously.

1919
01:24:25,655 --> 01:24:27,655
I just got voted out
of <i>Survivor.</i>

1920
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:29,586
It's kind of cool.

1921
01:24:32,068 --> 01:24:34,862
Grab your torches, head back
to camp. Good night.

1922
01:24:58,655 --> 01:25:01,310
You are swinging that thing
like you're on a scary movie.

1923
01:25:01,344 --> 01:25:03,724
- Here's Maryanne!
- Aah!

1924
01:25:03,758 --> 01:25:04,586
<i>
The game is shifting.</i>

1925
01:25:06,448 --> 01:25:07,655
I see the way forward now,

1926
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:09,482
<i>and that's to get Drea out.</i>

1927
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:12,931
<i>
I am mortified</i>

1928
01:25:12,965 --> 01:25:15,172
at this gameplay.

1929
01:25:15,206 --> 01:25:15,344
Wow.

1930
01:25:17,965 --> 01:25:19,931
<i>Survivor</i>
still is my favorite show.

1931
01:25:19,965 --> 01:25:22,344
<i>So, would I rather be</i> <i>
the first one voted out</i>

1932
01:25:22,379 --> 01:25:23,689
<i>or just never play at all?</i>

1933
01:25:23,724 --> 01:25:25,827
<i>Vote me out first</i> <i>
a million times.</i>

1934
01:25:25,862 --> 01:25:28,413
<i>The opportunity itself</i> <i>
means more than anything.</i>

1935
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:31,344
<i>Hey, I'm the first</i> <i>
unanimous vote. That's neat.</i>

1936
01:25:31,379 --> 01:25:35,793
<i>It's not what I wanted, but</i> <i>
it's a cool, uh, little fact</i>

1937
01:25:35,827 --> 01:25:38,000
you can put
on my <i>Survivor</i> Wiki page.
