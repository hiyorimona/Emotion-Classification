1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,022
It's been a very long night.

2
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,527
I'm not really up for discussing
all the ins and outs.

3
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:31,798
I'd prefer to do that when
we wake up or soon thereafter.

4
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,801
<i>Tribal Council was a disaster,</i>
<i>I would say, for me.</i>

5
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,170
<i>I made the decision</i>
<i>to trust Chanelle</i>

6
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,507
<i>as my number one</i>
<i>alliance member,</i>

7
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,742
<i>and the trust</i>
<i>wasn't really reciprocated.</i>

8
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,780
When it came time
to potentially go to rocks,

9
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,481
and we needed to convince Hai

10
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,619
<i>to vote for Lydia,</i>
<i>she didn't really have my bac.</i>

11
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,254
<i>And I feel like</i>

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,289
I've just totally...

13
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:00,126
totally screwed everything up.

14
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,162
I respect that,
uh, Daniel, you want

15
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,031
to talk to them tomorrow
privately, and that's fine.

16
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,634
For me,
I have a different approach,

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,103
and I just want
to put it out here now.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,471
I'm a little disappointed

19
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,407
that you said,
"Chanelle blindsided me."

20
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,843
I didn't vote. I didn't even
say anything at Tribal,

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,378
so I don't even think
that's fair.

22
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:23,316
<i>Tonight at Tribal, Daniel</i>
<i>threw me under the bus, saying,</i>

23
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,785
"Chanelle blindsided me
and backstabbed me,"

24
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:26,986
which I was a little confused
about because

25
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,455
<i>I didn't do anything</i>

26
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,023
<i>to, like, change the plan.</i>

27
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,792
<i>Was it my idea</i>
<i>to get Lydia out?</i>

28
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:39,365
Nah, sure. But, uh, I can't
admit to that because...

29
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,000
then that would ruin my game.

30
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,003
But Daniel did come up to me
and said, "Mike has an idol,

31
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,473
and he doesn't have a vote
at Tribal Council."

32
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,475
Daniel told that to me.

33
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,177
You blew up your game,
and then you turn...

34
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,445
I don't... I mean, I don't know.

35
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,646
I'm just telling you
what Daniel told me.

36
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,049
HAI: I appreciate both
of your inputs.

37
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:58,084
For me right now, even though
the vote went my way,

38
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,887
I'm feeling blindsided

39
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,424
by literally everyone
except poor Lydia,

40
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,659
who just went through hell.

41
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,162
I apparently did not know
where your games were,

42
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,297
but, hey, props to you.
Please don't think

43
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,099
-I'm mad at anyone.
It's<i> Survivor.</i>
-Nah.

44
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,368
But I owe Mike a lot
of explanations.

45
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,872
<i>Not only was Jenny blindsided.</i>

46
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,773
Mike was blindsided.

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,443
Chanelle and Daniel were both
blindsided because they thought

48
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,445
I was voting the way
they told me.

49
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,214
Everyone at our Tribal
was blindsided.

50
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,617
Chanelle and Daniel told me
to write your name down.

51
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,253
They wanted to split the vote--
you and Jenny.

52
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,954
And you know what I did?

53
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,223
I got to the booth,
and I felt uneasy about it,

54
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,658
so I wrote Jenny's name down.

55
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,960
<i>Daniel was so assertive</i>

56
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,930
<i>in the fact</i>
<i>that we could not go to rocks.</i>

57
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,766
I really do not want
to draw rocks.

58
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,735
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>This man is a lawyer.</i>

59
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,169
<i>He can talk circles around us.</i>

60
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,605
<i>But at that point, I knew</i>

61
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,674
I could shift the game
in my favor.

62
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,076
I'm not changing my vote.

63
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,679
<i>Daniel folded</i>
<i>like a ton of bricks.</i>

64
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,516
That man has literally
no backbone. None.

65
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,518
Daniel and Chanelle
are going to turn on each other.

66
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,587
-Yeah.
-Which is fine
because they're two snakes.

67
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,088
-And I thought
I could trust them.
-Well, I'm gonna

68
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,557
tell you right now.
I'm gonna tell you right now.

69
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,358
-And I hope
this is between me and you.
-Yeah.

70
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,194
At this moment,
Daniel is way down on my list.

71
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,030
-Yeah.
-After what he pulled tonight.

72
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,966
<i>Daniel absolutely lost my trust.</i>
<i>He was going behind my back,</i>

73
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,169
making other alliances,
and telling secrets I told him.

74
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,171
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>That's in the past.</i>

75
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,706
<i>What I need to do</i>

76
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,974
is move forward.

77
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,175
<i>I got to adapt.</i>

78
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,677
<i>Either I adapt,</i>
<i>or I'm a dinosaur.</i>

79
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,145
Can you work with Lydia and I?
'Cause we...

80
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,680
Of course. I love Lydia.

81
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,014
-We're together.
-Yeah.

82
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,149
-It's done.
-Okay.

83
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,550
I give you my word.

84
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,751
<i>I'm in survival mode now.</i>

85
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,953
<i>There ain't no kumbaya.</i>

86
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,955
The "K" left the "kumbaya."

87
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,356
The "umba," everything left.

88
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,225
There is no kumbaya.
It's like holy crap-baya.

89
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,560
That's what it's all about
right now,.

90
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,596
That's okay.

91
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,131
I didn't play you.
All I... all I did...

92
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,967
Listen, I'm not mad about it.
Just say it was gameplay,

93
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,336
-and I'm cool with it.
-Mike, Chanelle was
my number one,

94
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,304
and I wanted to be
totally loyal to her.

95
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,606
So you lied to me.
A lot of time.

96
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,107
I lied to you
because you broke my...

97
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:01,941
-You lied to me about a lot.
-You weren't my number one,

98
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,276
-so I lied...
-You told me I was.

99
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,111
-How many times have you lied?
-I've lied to you a lot.

100
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,679
-Because... because...
-Okay, you played.

101
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,981
-That's called playing me.
-I know.

102
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,049
I think I made a bad choice,

103
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,286
and I do regret it,
and if I blew up my game,

104
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,887
it's because I put my trust

105
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,489
in a person I shouldn't have
put my trust in.

<i>Once the votes were revealed,</i>

107
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,059
it exposed
that I was playing both sides,

108
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,995
but it seems to me

109
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,264
<i>that Chanelle has somehow</i>

her playing both sides.

00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,901
She's getting no blowback
from this as far as I can tell.

112
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,872
<i>That's crazy to me.</i>
<i>This game is totally fickle.</i>

113
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,109
It can turn on a dime, which is
what I'm hoping it does again,

114
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,810
because right now
I'm in a world of hurt,

115
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,646

-that first obstacle.
-Keep your rope together.

170
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,897
-Don't get tangled in your rope.
-This is where

171
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,365
you can get tangled quickly,

172
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,900
as Lydia is
already figuring out.

173
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,269
Don't get tangled in your rope!

174
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,137
Guys.

175
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,106
-What? Have you...? Here.
-This is stuck right here.

176
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,074
Let's go under, under! Under,

177
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,442
over and under!

178
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,245
-Need to get out of this knot.
-Under!

179
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,148
-(Maryanne whoops)
-PROBST: Taku's really
doing a nice job.

180
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,351
-They have got this challenge
figured out.
-Nice!

181
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,120
Here we go.

182
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,389
Super impressive!

183
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:40,259
Some spiced fish,
roast fish, smoked fish.

184
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,498
You're good, Taku.
Try to lasso that now.

185
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,537
Jonathan trying
to hook their sled.

186
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,972
Now it is green and blue
once again...

187
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,373
Gather it at the three points.

188
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,209
...doing the dance
to untangle the ropes.

189
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,145
-They need to take a lesson
from Taku.

190
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,813
-That's a nice toss.

191
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,649
They've got it.
Taku has hooked their sled.

192
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,952
-Pull.

193
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,087
-Pull, pull.
-They're gonna be

194
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,222
moving on to the last phase
of this challenge.

195
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,224
-Pull.

196
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,960
You're good! Take your balls up,
start shooting.

197
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,129
-Maryanne, do you want
to go first?
-First?

198
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,232
-Yeah.
-Let's keep going!

199
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,633
-Let's go, guys!
-The rest of them here.

200
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,603
-Let's go!
-Mike, get your rope!

201
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,904
Pick it up. Here.

202
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,672
-You're good, you're good.
-Maryanne

00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,374

-Little forward.

204
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,642
-Launches it.
-Yeah.

205
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,977
-Yeah, girl!

206
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,013
Maryanne has her ball in.
She's good. Omar's up.

207
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,016
-Same thing.
-In and out.

208
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,351
-We're not giving up.
-We're not giving up.

209
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,685
-We're not giving up.
-Vati, Ika

210
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,020
trying to stay in this.

211
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,122
-Let's go, Ika!
-Keep it going!

212
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,423
Let's go!

213
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,728
Omar launches his second.
He's got it.

214
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,963
Ika's through that second phase.

215
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,466
-Ika now gonna try
to get their sled.
-Go, Tori!

216
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:54,834
Gather your rope! Let's go!

217
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,136
-Take that.

218
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,141
-Jonathan has one!

219
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,310
It is as if Taku had

220
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,445
been practicing
this entire challenge

221
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,047
-for months.
-Yeah!
-We love you.

222
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:12,551
Lindsay, the last
remaining tribe member.

223
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,187
-Good job.
-Taku wins reward!

224
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,824
Ten fish waiting for you
back at camp.

225
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,027
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my goodness.

226
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,097
Guys, that was awesome.

227
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,936
-Of course. Of course.
-It's okay.

228
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,312
Taku,
another dominating victory.

229
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,682
It's not that Vati and Ika
were necessarily slow.

230
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,750
It's just,
you were unusually fast.

231
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,853
Jonathan, does it speak
to the idea of a tribe

232
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,957
-finding its core?
-Absolutely.

233
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,826
We have such a solid four, Jeff,

234
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,763
that I feel comfortable working
with these guys so much that

235
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,001
these challenges are not easy,
but, I mean, we've been winning.

236
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,337
And it's so encouraging now.
I'm stoked.

237
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,773
PROBST:
Tori, can you learn anything
when you see a tribe

238
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,675
lose early,
but now they're dominating?

239
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,044
We all see Goliath. Like,
he's huge. He's dominating.

240
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,413
That last challenge
that we could not complete--

241
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,848
you even gave him credit.
You said,

242
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,717
that was one of the most
impressive individual feats

243
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,520
you have seen. So, it's hard
to not view them as, like,

244
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,122
indestructible,
because they have this Goliath,

245
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,324
and they seem to be
working so well, but

246
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,692
there's something that we have
to figure out that they're doing

247
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,227
that we're not doing yet.

248
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,497
PROBST:
All right, Taku,

00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,699
ten freshly-caught,
decent-sized fish

00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,568
waiting for you back at camp.
Grab your stuff.

00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,436

he can do everything better
than the rest of us.

ROCKSROY:
The sticks are gonna burn.
Let the sticks burn.

335
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,966
Let the fire... Let the sticks
burn a little bit.

Show montage--
Rocksroy and Romeo in the woods.

341
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,445
If you got that,
just keep going.

342
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,713
I don't... Okay.

343
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,714
"Make a knot here."

344
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,215
You see how tight mine is?

345
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,550
You got to make 'em tighter.

346
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,551
"Pick that one up."

347
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,152
-Get it up on something.
-Oh.

348
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,321
-You want to put it on there?
-No, no. I'm saying, get it up.

349
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,023
"Yeah, no problem, no problem,
no problem, no problem."

350
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,226
In my mind, I'm thinking
"Shut the hell up!"

351
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,462
But I can't do that here,
you know?

352
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,130
You have to keep your cool.

353
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,302
TORI:
So, what are your thoughts?

354
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,772
What I'm thinking about is, if
we have to go to Tribal again...

355
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,707
TORI:
Yeah.

356
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,778
Yeah.

357
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,413
<i>SWATI:</i>
<i>At this point I feel like</i>

358
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,882
I'm not in a power position
on the tribe,

359
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,384
<i>and I want to change that.</i>

360
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,954
<i>So, I have a plan in the works</i>
<i>to vote out Drea.</i>

361
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,424
<i>She has an extra vote</i>
<i>and, thus, holds a lot of power.</i>

362
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,661
<i>But to do that, we need</i>
<i>to pull in a third person.</i>

363
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,699
I don't get along
with Rocks very well.

364
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,401
-You don't?
-He annoys the freak out of me.

365
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,835
No.

366
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,477
TORI:
Uh-huh.

367
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,814
This is disappointing
because it's, like,

368
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,783
I did want to work with Drea,

369
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,486
and I'm not as excited working
with, like, Rocksroy,

370
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,455
but I will.

371
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,990
<i>I do trust Swati.</i>
<i>Swati is my biggest ally.</i>

372
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,459
<i>So, if people actually</i>
<i>do want me out,</i>

373
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,695
<i>I have to do something.</i>
<i>But what's hard is</i>

374
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,730
<i>trying to deal with Rocksroy.</i>

375
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,732
His way is, like,<i> the</i> way,

376
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,434
<i>and it's really frustrating.</i>

377
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,436
And I just want you to know
I'm so

378
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,404
freaking thankful
you're on our tribe because

379
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,574
I really don't know what would
happen if you weren't there.

380
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,143
ROCKSROY:
Here's the thing.

381
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,611
When it comes to getting fire,
when it comes

382
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:20,979
-to maintaining the fire...
-Yes.

383
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,648
when it comes
to trying to get food,

384
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,083
-when it comes
to going fishing...
-Yup.

385
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,551
when it comes to trying
to build-build a shelter,

386
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm not asking anyone
to come help me. I'm just like,

387
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,655
-"I'll just go and do it."
-You honestly haven't.

388
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,223
Because I am right.

389
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,791
<i>TORI:</i>
<i>Rocksroy displays</i>
<i>these tendencies</i>

390
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,927
<i>of, like, a narcissist.</i>

391
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:39,131
<i>It's, like, unless an idea comes</i>
<i>from him, it's not a good idea.</i>

392
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,566
And I've worked with clients
who are in relationships

393
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,768
with narcissists, and sometimes

394
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,370
the best advice is
to, like, get out.

395
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,171
Really, if you can,
but I want to try with Rocksroy.

396
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,773
I can't get out.

397
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,843
<i>Then should get rid of Drea.</i>
<i>We're gonna need Rocksroy.</i>

398

-It gets back

399
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,014
-to what those guys are doing
now on the "journey."
-Uh-huh.

400
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,685
ROCKSROY:
What if there is an advantage
at play,

401
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,720
and someone has it?

402
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,188
Well, do you know
about Drea's advantage?

403
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,690
I don't know
about her advantage.

404
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,792
She has an extra vote.

405
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,193
She didn't tell you?

406
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,629
-I didn't know that.
-TORI: Yeah. Rocks,

407
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,465
I'm telling you all of this
because I want to work with you.

408
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,134
She wouldn't see it coming

409
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,835
if me, you and Swati worked
together, you know?

410
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,170
-Hey.
-What?

411
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,338
I haven't committed to anybody

412
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,440
-I'm gonna vote for...
-No, and I...

413
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,342
because
there's not even any question

414
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,177
of us going to Tribal yet.

415
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:29,014
<i>Tori came to me and said</i>
<i>Drea has an extra vote.</i>

416
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,682
Tori knows
that she's at the bottom

417
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,551
of the pecking order, I believe.

418
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,587
<i>So her game is to try</i>
<i>to bring myself and Swati in</i>

419
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,190
<i>to try to make an alliance,</i>
<i>and the person</i>

420
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,392
that she wants to go after
is Drea, for some reason.

421
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,860
I don't know why.

422
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:45,564
<i>But it's not gonna happen,</i>
<i>because in my gut,</i>

423
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,200
<i>I just do not trust Tori.</i>

424
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,806
She said you have an extra vote.

425
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,141
-Don't think anything of me.
-I don't.

Wow. Okay.

-That's good to know.
-Mm-hmm.

434
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,397
-It sucks.
-It does suck.

435
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,399
DREA:
It personally hurt because

436
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,935
I did everything I could
to keep her in the game.

437
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,103
Right. Me, too.
And, like, this is, like,

438
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,839
I can't work with her now.

439
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,740
Yeah.

440
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,742
<i>SWATI:</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Tori shared more information</i>

<i>and got busted, and now</i>

442

<i>I have to step back and reassess</i>
<i>before I get myself in trouble.</i>

<i>I would like to work with her,</i>

444
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,288
I'm not going
to go down with her.

00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,242
PROBST: All right,
so how are we doing today?

446
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,612
Daniel, how are you feeling a
third of the way into this game?

447
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,781
You know, it just doesn't
come through on the TV screen.

448
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,683
Really, it's brutal.
The only reason

449
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,719
I'm alive today is because
of Hai's body heat,

450
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,221
keeping me warm last night
in that torrential downpour.

451
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,791
Maryanne, describe the rain.

452
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,228
You know what?
The rain keeps on going down

453
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,597
and going down, and it's like, I
know I've said it so many times,

454
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,866
but it just explains it
so perfectly.

455
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,536
It's the classic tale
of the bunny rabbit eating it...

456
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,638
the dinner in the mailbox,
you know?

457
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,339
And we're the bunny rabbits
all being like,

458
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,341
"Where's the mailbox?"
Like, we need to go in,

459
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,176

we need to be warm.

<i>What are the other tribes doing?</i>
<i>I'm just thinking that they're</i>

<i>I'm so disappointed</i>

-(all assent)
-First things first.

472
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,338
Got to take back the idols.
Thank you, Drea.

473
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,980

immunity is back up for grabs.

<i>For today's challenge,</i>

<i>grabbing a key.</i>
<i>Will then race</i>

481
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,499
<i>to the finish</i>
<i>where you will use that key</i>

482
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,535

Drea, so when you hear
Swati throw out something,

823
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,336
and it surrounds you,

824
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,905
what happens internally?

825
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,107
It sucks,
because I'm the main person

826
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,310
that's trying
to bring this team together.

827
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,612
And yet
Drea's name is always up.

828
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,448
So I just take
all the information

829
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,451
that's thrown out there,
and I calculate it in my mind

830
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,187
to figure out
what makes sense to me.

831
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,856
There's so many truths, and then
there's, like, the real truth.

832
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,558
SWATI:
Jeff,

833
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,361
I'm here to tell my truth,
which is that everything

834
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,929
that's happening,
it's not my fault.

835
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,965
I am not... I don't know
if I'm being painted

836
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,902
as the agent of chaos by Tori,
but it's her who made this move,

837
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,070
her who got caught doing it.

838
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,371
I'm just here to say

839
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,873
I'm doing exactly what
I said I was going to do,

840
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,842
and I hope that
others can trust me

841
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,111
and that we can move forward
as a more unified tribe.

842
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,514
Romeo, do you understand
what Swati's getting at?

843
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,849
Because she's hit it
a few times.

844
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,951
She's pointing a finger at Tori
and saying,

845
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,152
"That's the problem."

846
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,722
Yes, she clearly wants Tori out.

847
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,657
And I think
we just need to trust

848
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,727
in the target that
the majority of us chose

849
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,128
to move forward
in a more peaceful way.

850
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,464
And hopefully,
after today's Tribal Council,

851
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,399
we will be able
to work better together

852
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,868
and just be
a more cohesive group.

853
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,438
PROBST:
Tori, Swati has not backed off.

854
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,406
What are you feeling now,

855
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,241
sitting there
in the center of this group?

856
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,377
Kind of hard to combat
with what she was saying,

857
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,112
'cause so much of it
was not rooted in reality.

858
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,347
I just, I really don't know
where this energy is

859
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,383
coming from. I feel like it's--
you feel that you're vulnerable,

860
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,917
trying to throw it
on someone else.

861
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,619
My name has been
out there before.

862
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,423
Um, it's sad to me, but
you gotta do what you gotta do.

863
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,891
ROCKSROY:
Can I say something about Swati?

864
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,661
She came in here,
and she told us she's very shy.

865
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,497
So for her to step up
and, like, speak out like this,

866
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,765
I am very proud of her.

867
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,267
Because it's-it's very...
it's very difficult

868
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,536
to come out and
out of your shell a little bit

869
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,837
and push...
put yourself out there.

870
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,839
Her personality now is blooming.

871
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,341
She's coming out.

872
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,244
Swati, how's that feel? It's
a very parental thing to do,

873
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,213
is to acknowledge a quality
they see in you.

874
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,349
It actually feels really good,
because that is something

875
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,650
I really struggled with,

876
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,154
and I feel like I lost
a lot of the insecurities

877
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,156
that I walked in here with.

878
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:46,924
Being able to come
to a group of people

879
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,994
and have them accept me
was a really freeing experience.

880
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:53,030
I would love to give more
than that, but I feel like,

881
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,299
regardless of how long
my<i> Survivor</i> experience is,
