00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,880
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,740
<i>Tribal was a blindside
for Rocksroy.</i>

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,900
<i>Me and Drea pulled in
Tori to vote for Swati,</i>

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,020
<i>and we decided
not to tell Rocksroy.</i>

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,220
<i>He's not really a social player,</i>

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,740
<i>and once he says something,
he's going to stick to it,</i>

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,220
<i>so we knew that he was going
to vote for Tori regardless.</i>

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,620
Let's start from the beginning.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,180
Swati looked me in
my eyes, and she said:

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,800
- "You're my number one."
- Right.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,360
Come to find out,

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,600
she told everybody in
camp that same story.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,940
- Yep.
- To me, she was a bigger...

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,200
...threat than anybody here,
and she needed to go.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,320
And I knew that you weren't
going to vote against her.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,920
<i>I feel a little betrayed.</i>

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
<i>I got duped.</i>

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,800
You know what?
I'm actually happy that

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,300
you did it the way you did it.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,660
If she's playing both
sides of the coin,

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,720
that's someone
we cannot take with us

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,040
further in this game,
and I'm happy

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,080
that you guys
weeded it out.

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,300
- Yeah.
- Good on y'all.

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,200
<i>I did not see this coming.</i>

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,720
<i>Obviously, I'm not picking up
on social cues.</i>

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,280
I guess my social game is
really not that good.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,540
No, it's good.

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,220
- But I'm learning.
- You made allies.

31
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,080
If I got to ride you
guys' social coattails,

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,520
- I will.
- No.

33
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,400
We just need to be a
strong four here.

34
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,340
<i>"Four strong" literally
makes me laugh. </i>

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,920
<i>I sit there, and I just literally
say: "No, no, no, no, no."</i>

36
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,880
- We need to find that, like, unity.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,320
We can't have that weird
vibe anymore, we got to...

38
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,880
<i>I'm gonna be the first
person to jump ship.</i>

39
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,300
<i>I have no desire to do that.</i>

40
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,260
<i>Because of Rocks.
That's why.</i>

41
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,360
<i>All he's focused on is
the shelter and the fire, like,</i>

42
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,680
<i>he's just not playing
the same game</i>

43
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,240
<i>that we are, and
it's really frustrating.</i>

44
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,020
Sorry for writing your name down, Tori.

45
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,760
- No, it's... I mean, it's a game.
- I hope that doesn't come back...

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,700
...and bite me in
the friggin' buttocks.

47
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>I just want him gone, but
I'm still gonna suck up to him</i>

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,800
<i>and be like:
"Absolutely four strong. "</i>

49
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,240
<i>"That sounds like a great idea."</i>

50
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,800
<i>But that's not what
I'm actually going to do.</i>

51
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,680
I'm baller at Mario Kart.

52
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,880
Oh, you have not met me, buddy.

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,220
I've been playing Mario Kart
before you were born.

54
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,920
I know this 'cause I'm
baller at Mario Kart.

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,080
Yeah, but I hit that acceleration
on "three, two, one, go,"

56
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,920
I always win then.

57
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,540
- Oh, okay.
- I got a trick.

58
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,780
You see, I'm arrogant,
and I know that I'm the best,

59
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,480
so I play as my Mii.

60
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,860
- Oh, you're Mii?
- Ah! Yeah!

61
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,800
<i>How much these girls
talk drives me crazy.</i>

62
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,380
And then I lost it on an
airplane to San Diego

63
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,360
on Friday the 13th, and
I cried so bad, my mom...

64
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,440
<i>I don't know why they always
feel like there can't be silence,</i>

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,520
<i>but there isn't five seconds
without one of 'em...</i>

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,060
Huge, huge, giant monkey animal.

67
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,180
I was in a musical, right?
Like a school musical.

68
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,160
So I whip out my phone

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,960
and call in sick at
work and walk out!

70
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,520
Oh, my God.

71
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,580
That is the Taku
news at 7:00 a.m.

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,820
Thank you, guys,
and make sure you tune in.

73
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,680
There you go.

74
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,540
- That's how you end it.
- But, um...

75
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,900
Oh, Jonathan's the
first to explore.

76
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,800
Rain showers in Fiji...

77
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,080
- ....happening from 6:30 to 7:30.
- It's a sun-shower.

78
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,200
Is my canteen in there?

79
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,660
Play hot and cold.

80
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,100
- Warm.
- Warmer.

81
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,980
- Warmer.
- Warmer.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,240
Warmer.
Hot.

83
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,180
Warm.

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,540
Warm.

85
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,840
That's not how you play.

86
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,780
- Now he's warmer.
- Hot, hot, hot.

87
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,220
- Oh, my God.
- Burning, wait.

88
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,640
It's a very simple concept.

89
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,620
Oh, you go:
"Colder"?

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,180
Right, but then he was veering
in the opposite direction,

91
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,320
- ...so then you say: "Colder."
- Then you say: "Colder."

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,320
No, because you're
not hot anymore.

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,660
- I know, but it's not...
- You're now warm, back to warm.

94
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,000
- No.
- I see what you're saying.

95
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,100
<i>I don't even know what
they're talking about.</i>

96
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,340
<i>And I'm like:
"I'm out of here."</i>

97
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,600
<i>I have to leave
the situation because</i>

98
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,980
<i>arguing about hot and
cold games or anything,</i>

99
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,820
<i>like, so little is just ridiculous.</i>

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,460
<i>So thank God we
got fishing equipment,</i>

101
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,420
<i>'cause I'm gonna be
in the water half the time,</i>

102
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,380
<i>and I won't have
to listen to Maryanne</i>

103
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,580
<i>and Lindsay just constantly
going at it about nothing.</i>

104
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,640
<i>That's my escape,
just getting in the water</i>

105
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,000
<i>it helps me a lot.</i>

106
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,860
<i>If I'm alone in the water
for two or three hours,</i>

107
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,160
<i>I can come back to camp
and deal with all this baloney.</i>

108
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,220
I did not hit you.

109
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,200
My foot was under it.
Then you hit it down.

110
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,660
You know I'm doing this.

111
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,160
- Why did you walk over here?
- I was walking...

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,940
- ...and then you hit me.
- Okay, back up.

113
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,160
Yeah.

114
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,560
You're so dramatic.
It drives me crazy.

115
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,740
- You hit me, man.
- No, I did not hit you.

116
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,160
<i>Every time something little
happens at camp,</i>

117
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,360
<i>Maryanne makes it
into a ten out of ten.</i>

118
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,960
<i>But I have to control
myself 'cause I can't lose it.</i>

119
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,360
<i>Once I lose it, every... I'm gonna
be labeled as a bad guy. </i>

120
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,720
<i>I'm six-four, I'm 250 pounds,
and I just screamed</i>

121
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,700
<i>at the little girl
that's five-two.</i>

122
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,180
<i>As soon as that happens,
it's over.</i>

123
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,360
I'm swinging a hatchet...

124
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,080
- ...and then you put your toe underneath it...
- But this is my work space.

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,840
You came into my work space.

126
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,680
- You're walking back and forth.
- Because it's all my work space.

127
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,620
- Okay, I can't argue with you, Maryanne.
- Look, this is what I'm saying.

128
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,540
- I love you, I don't want to...
- This is what I'm saying.

129
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,840
- Okay.
- Okay?

130
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
<i>After we go and
we left the bamboo,</i>

131
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,040
<i>Jonathan immediately went
to the water well with Lindsay,</i>

132
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,560
<i>and I started to get paranoid.</i>

133
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,140
<i>Like, now is he saying:
"Hey, let's go get Maryanne"?</i>

134
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,040
Is it just me, or is Maryanne getting worse?

135
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,820
Yeah.

136
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,060
- She just is so annoying.
- Yeah.

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,080
- I think we need to do Maryanne.
- Yes.

138
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,900
- 100%.
- 100%.

139
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,020
I hope he knows
pride's a deadly sin.

140
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,580
<i>This type of stupid fight
that's rifting people apart</i>

141
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,400
<i>is exactly what I don't want.</i>

142
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,920
It's a shame he's too good
of a frickin' shield.

143
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,660
<i>Maryanne is annoying,</i>

144
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,920
<i>but she has a potential
immunity idol,</i>

145
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,660
<i>and she has an extra vote.</i>

146
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,120
<i>Like, we need her.</i>

147
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,360
<i>And I guarantee you,
come the merge time,</i>

148
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,520
<i>if the other tribes see
this sort of behavior, </i>

149
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,100
<i>they'll jump on that right away.</i>

150
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,160
<i>They'll pick her up,
and before you know it,</i>

151
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,520
<i>you're going to be gone because
you couldn't stop being petty.</i>

152
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,280
I'm a little down, I was
hoping we'd merge today.

153
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,380
- You know?
- I know.

154
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,540
<i>The Vati tribe right now it's tense.</i>

155
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,500
- Hi, Hai.
- Hey.

156
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,480
<i>When we're all
around each other,</i>

157
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,500
<i>it's smiles, but I don't
trust these people.</i>

158
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,740
<i>And it took until the first
Tribal for me to realize that.</i>

159
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
- So...
- I promise you...

160
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,520
that if we both make merge...

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,720
- Bygones be bygones?
- Bygones are bygones.

162
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,000
- We need each other.
- Yeah.

163
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,000
<i>Now, the two games
that really blew up</i>

164
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,220
<i>were Chanelle and Daniel.</i>

165
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,960
I'm gonna have to take...

166
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,560
<i>I have no trust for them.</i>

167
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,340
I know that Daniel's like
the obvious threat to take out,

168
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,100
but he's transparent.

169
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,220
- Chanelle's not transparent.
- Yeah, she's not.

170
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,920
She's harder to read,
and to me that's scary.

171
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,180
They're both scary to me...

172
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,380
- So...
-. ..in a way.

173
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,640
The easy vote,

174
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,720
especially if we want
to make the merge,

175
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,080
is Chanelle.

176
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,000
Mike, do you think you can
get fire going today?

177
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,440
I just don't want to start it
until we have food because...

178
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,760
or we know where
to get food because...

179
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,820
So should we go fishing
first, fire second?

180
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,580
Yeah, 'cause
there's not a lot of...

181
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,400
- There's not a lot of dry wood.
- Okay.

182
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,940
<i>The Vati tribe,</i>

183
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,700
<i>in terms of morale,
I'd give us a "B."</i>

184
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,720
<i>But in terms of actual
survival performance,</i>

185
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,940
<i>I'd give us...</i>

186
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,380
<i>a D-minus.</i>

187
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,200
Don't lose the spear.

188
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,420
<i>We're running off of the fat
that we have on our bodies.</i>

189
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,400
<i>That's pretty much it.</i>

190
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,780
<i>We need to go get fish.</i>

191
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,100
-  Go, Daniel!
- Dan, I believe in you!

192
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,220
Get out there, pal.

193
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,720
- Not.
- You're gonna make it.

194
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,720
All right.

195
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,020
<i>I'm as much a natural fishermen</i>

196
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,980
<i>as an arsonist is
a natural fireman.</i>

197
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,280
<i>But yet it seemed like
the sort of thing</i>

198
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,100
<i>that one must do in Survivor.</i>

199
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,120
<i>Spearfishing is something that's
always highlighted on Survivor.</i>

200
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,680
<i>It always looks cool.</i>

201
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,940
<i>You're using this nifty gadget</i>

202
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,260
<i>to, like, see beautiful coral reefs</i>

203
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,560
<i>and try to catch these
glorious-looking fish.</i>

204
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,030
<i>I think I was more
snorkeling than fishing,</i>

205
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,000
<i>but I was giving fishing
my best shot.</i>

206
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,880
<i>People forget that
fun is important.</i>

207
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,540
<i>They're just so
focused on, like: </i>

208
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,800
<i>"Oh, the next vote is this.
When is the merge?"</i>

209
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,840
<i>It's like: "Calm down.
You're on Survivor."</i>

210
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,120
<i>"Just, like, enjoy yourself."</i>

211
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,160
If he comes out with a limp arm again...

212
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,480
I swear to God.

213
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,200
Wait...

214
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,480
so, he can't compete in physical
challenges but he can go...

215
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,720
spear fishing?

216
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,240
That's what I'm confused about.

217
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,940
<i>Daniel's arm has been
dislocated since day one,</i>

218
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,100
<i>but yet today he's in
the ocean fishing!</i>

219
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,280
<i>What?!</i>

220
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,660
Hey, Mike, Chanelle.

221
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,140
He can't compete
in swimming challenges,

222
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,700
but he can go
swimming for fish?

223
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,540
You can't swim
in a challenge, but

224
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,000
you're gonna go into open
water with a spear, and you're...

225
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,040
<i>Daniel says he
has to stay out of</i>

226
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,980
<i>all the swimming challenges
because he can't swim.</i>

227
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,980
<i>You see how far away
that coral reef is?</i>

228
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,860
It's beautiful out there.

229
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,220
- You guys should go out there.
- Did you see a fish?

230
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,340
Tons of fish.

231
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,560
So you're saying
your aim sucks?

232
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,020
Yes, my aim sucks.
I came close a few times.

233
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,500
You were out there
a long time, too.

234
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,440
- It's really beautiful.
- Was it hard to swim out there?

235
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,920
I find it rather relaxing
and meditating.

236
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,300
<i>We've carried Daniel
from day one,</i>

237
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,360
<i>hiding his shoulder,
putting him out of challenges</i>

238
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,640
<i>so it's not exposed.</i>

239
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,720
<i>How long can you carry a guy</i>

240
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,280
<i>before he becomes
a true liability?</i>

241
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,320
Where'd everyone go?

242
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,180
T went to get water.
Rocks is in the ocean...

243
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,300
...or looking for an idoll.

244
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,420
We should start actually
really doing that.

245
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,940
Yeah, we need to.

246
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,060
<i>We know that there's
an idol out here.</i>

247
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,860
<i>And if there was an idol,
I want myself</i>

248
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,040
<i>or Drea to find it because
she's my number one ally.</i>

249
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,060
What about that one?

250
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,680
<i>The fact that Drea trusts me
enough to go out</i>

251
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,220
<i>and look for a hidden
immunity idol with her proves</i>

252
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,720
<i>how important it is
to have that one person</i>

253
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,360
<i>that you can trust in this game.</i>

254
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,180
<i>And I think that's Drea for me.</i>

255
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm gonna keep looking and looking.

256
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,760
We can do this.

257
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,920
<i>Because I work primarily
with women back home</i>

258
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,960
<i>as a pageant coach,
I like working</i>

259
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,260
<i>with strong, independent women.</i>

260
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,940
<i>And I think that's what I saw
in Drea when I first met her.</i>

261
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,000
<i>It was just an instant connection.</i>

262
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,740
<i>One of my role models in
life has always been my mom.</i>

263
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,480
<i>She's just the
strongest woman I know.</i>

264
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,140
<i>She moved to the U.S., and
her entire family was back home</i>

265
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,500
<i>in Central America, so she
sacrificed a lot for me and my sisters.</i>

266
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,900
<i>And that's why I feel like
it's my duty to give back</i>

267
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,640
<i>to strong, independent women.</i>

268
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,800
<i>So I'd like to think that
I'm also coaching Drea</i>

269
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,200
<i>to become an even
better Survivor player</i>

270
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,440
<i>than she already is, and
today we want to find that idol.</i>

271
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,340
"Beware Advantage!"

272
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,800
"If you take it, it's yours and
you must do what it says."

273
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,720
"Otherwise, leave it."

274
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,560
What?

275
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,800
<i>It says "Beware."</i>

276
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,380
<i>I already took a risk
before with the extra vote,</i>

277
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,100
<i>so if it's dangerous,
I'm gonna do it.</i>

278
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,100
"Congratulations, you have found a
three-way shared immunity idol."

279
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,480
<i>This is an idol.</i>

280
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,480
<i>Most women are stuck at camp,</i>

281
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,780
<i>making rice or whatever,
and I just didn't care.</i>

282
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,040
<i>I went out to find an idol.
So kudos.</i>

283
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,520
<i>Women in the new era Survivor 2.0
we can find idols, too.</i>

284
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,240
<i>We're just as good as men.
Probably better, actually.</i>

285
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,760
<i>We're better than men.
Sorry.</i>

286
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,360
"Each tribe beach has one."

287
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,200
"At the next inmunity challenge
you must say a secret phrase..."

288
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,840
"in front of the other players."

289
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,040
"Once all three phrases have been said..."

290
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,380
"at the same immunity challenge,
then all three idols have power."

291
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,380
"But until then, you cannot vote
at any Tribal Council."

292
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,260
- "This is why..."
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

293
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,680
- "Until then, you..."
- "...you cannot vote at any Tribal Council."

294
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,280
<i>Right now, I don't have a vote,</i>

295
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,780
<i>but I have an extra vote.</i>

296
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,220
<i>And if you have a right ally
who can help you,</i>

297
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,800
<i>you can maneuver
around any kind of...</i>

298
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,780
<i>bad juju this thing has.</i>

299
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,620
I have an extra vote, and
I can give you the extra vote.

300
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,180
Okay, so it's like if you're voting
but I'm voting for you..

301
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,000
<i>I have literally
checked every single</i>

302
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,480
<i>Survivor bucket list here.</i>

303
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,980
<i>I have extra vote,
my amulet and my idol.</i>

304
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,420
<i>Currency is everything in Survivor.</i>

305
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,940
<i>And I think I'm Survivor rich.</i>

306
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,460
"Your phrase: Potatoes have skin.
I have skin. Am I a potato?"

307
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,480
"The other two phrases..."

308
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,260
"There's such grace in the game
of soccer it makes me cry."

309
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,600
"It's another classic case of the bunny
rabbit having dinner in the mailbox."

310
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,760
"Rabbit."
She found it.

311
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,580
<i>Maryanne says something
about bunnies.</i>

312
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,880
It kind of reminds
me of the classic tale

313
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,460
of the bunny rabbit eating
its dinner in the mailbox.

314
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,620
<i>Instantly, I know she
has the other one.</i>

315
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,220
Can you tell that
it's in my crotch?

316
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,520
No.

317
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,160
<i>So I am hoping
that some Einstein on Vati</i>

318
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,960
<i>finally finds this and can
say it at the same time</i>

319
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,000
<i>so that we can be done
and over with this.</i>

320
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,100
Are you going to try and activate your idol?

321
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,180
No, if I keep it a secret
until we get to the merge...

322
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,200
- Right, no one will know about the idol.
- ...then no one knows...

323
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,120
Do you get your vote
back at the merge?

324
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,860
- Yep.
- Yeah.

325
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,580
Automatically.

326
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,860
So you have to say the
sentence to activate it early.

327
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:23,900
- Yes.
- Yeah.

328
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,780
Yes, definitely.

329
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,200
So, if we merge tomorrow,
we have an idol,

330
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,700
and I get my vote back
with nobody knowing.

331
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,200
<i>I did find the hidden
immunity idol,</i>

332
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,780
<i>and everybody in our
camp knows about it.</i>

333
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,100
<i>But I don't want nobody
to know I have an idol</i>

334
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,640
<i>from any other tribe because
it puts a target on my back.</i>

335
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,520
If we get to that
merge with that idol,

336
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,380
- and nobody knows...
- And no one knows.

337
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,420
- ...it's a huge weapon for us.
- Yeah.

338
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,720
<i>I'm balancing...</i>

339
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,600
<i>not activating my idol
and not having a vote.</i>

340
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,440
<i>I don't know if
that's balls or stupidity.</i>

341
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,660
Hey, listen, it's a gamble.
I got to be honest with you.

342
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,200
- Right, it's like playing poker.
- Yeah.

343
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,240
And I got to tell you,
we're playing poker pretty good.

344
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,140
<i>So if I go to the immunity
challenge, and I hear</i>

345
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,260
<i>a member of each other
tribe chant their phrase,</i>

346
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,100
<i>I have to make immediate decision.</i>

347
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,800
<i>Do I say my phrase
or not say it?</i>

348
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,310
Come on in.

349
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,360
Taku, Vati, getting your first look

350
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,560
at the new Ika tribe.

351
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,180
Swati voted out at
the last Tribal Council.

352
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,740
And once again,
right on cue, Maryanne

353
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,740
jaw drops,
mouth open, aghast.

354
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,720
It's the classic case
of the bunny rabbit

355
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,420
having dinner at the mailbox.

356
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,520
Like, I always think:
"Okay, this time,

357
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,180
I know what's gonna
happen, this time."

358
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,520
But you never know
in the game of Survivor.

359
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,680
How is everybody
doing 11 days in?

360
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,520
- Hungry.
- What...?

361
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,260
- Hungry.
- Agreed.

362
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,560
- Hungry.
- Very hungry.

363
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,320
Okay.

364
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,160
You start going crazy, like,
even when you get food.

365
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,000
Like, we got a potato,
and I was staring at it

366
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,960
for, like, a very,
very long time.

367
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,780
And then we were peeling it,

368
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,560
and I was just all like:
"This potato has skin.

369
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,340
We have skin.
Are we just all potatoes?"

370
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,500
- Oh, my gosh.
- We're tripping.

371
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,640
So it's changing your
relationship with food.

372
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,300
I've always loved food, man,

373
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,860
but, like, now I think
I've got to marry it.

374
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,340
And we're back to love.

375
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,020
The theme for Maryanne.

376
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,240
Jeff, I got to say something.

377
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,480
There's such grace in a game
of soccer that it makes me cry.

378
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Now you wonder
why I'm saying that.

379
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,240
Yeah.

380
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,520
See, I used to coach
youth football,

381
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,460
and soccer season
and football season

382
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
were at the same time.

383
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,420
<i>Finally!
Yes!</i>

384
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,180
<i>I've been waiting so long
to just hear something back.</i>

385
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,440
One day, one of my
players jumps up to:

386
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,600
"But, Coach, there is such grace

387
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,540
in soccer that it makes me cry."

388
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,440
Oh, thank God!

389
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,660
<i>I have my vote,
and I have my idol.</i>

390
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,040
So, there is such
grace in soccer

391
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,560
that it makes
me cry, gentlemen.

392
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,780
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

393
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,680
<i>I recite my phrase,</i>

394
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,440
<i>which initially wasn't my plan.</i>

395
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,520
<i>But, honestly, it was a
game-time decision.</i>

396
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,040
<i>It was getting later and
later in the tribe game,</i>

397
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,460
<i>and I really thought
my vote was essential.</i>

398
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,600
<i>So this goes from the
non-idol to the active idol.</i>

399
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,340
<i>And guess who has it.</i>

400
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,920
<i>It's a guy with two thumbs.</i>

401
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,480
<i>This guy.</i>

402
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,780
All right, shall we get to
today's immunity challenge?

403
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,300
- Yeah.
- Yes.

404
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,600
All right, first things first.
Got to take back the idols.

405
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,820
Thank you.

406
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,680
- Here you go, Jeff.
- Thank you.

407
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,540
Once again, immunity is
back up for grabs.

408
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,220
For today's challenge,
you're going to race up and over

409
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,480
<i>a tall net ramp.</i>

410
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,940
<i>One player will then
untangle braided ropes</i>

411
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,960
<i>to release a key.</i>

412
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,080
<i>You'll use that key to
unlock a machete,</i>

413
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,660
<i>use the machete to
drop a load of sandbags.</i>

414
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,180
<i>You will then fire those
sandbags, two targets.</i>

415
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,760
First two tribes to
finish win immunity,

416
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,520
safe from the vote.

417
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,660
In addition,
playing for a reward.

418
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,140
Want to know what
you're playing for?

419
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,000
- Yes.
- Please.

420
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,440
- Please be food.
- Please be food.

421
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,160
- And sauce.
- Cooked food.

422
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,380
- Food and sauce.
- Cooked food.

423
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,460
Do it, do it, Jeff.
Just do it, Jeff.

424
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,300
Do you want the bad news?

425
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,900
- Yeah, here it comes.
- It's not food.

426
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,080
We'll take a tarp.

427
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,860
A tarp you got.

428
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,340
That's better than food.

429
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,580
That's much better.

430
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,360
First tribe to finish
a very large tarp.

431
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,500
Smaller tarp for
the second tribe.

432
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,260
Losers Tribal Council where somebody

433
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,080
will be voted out of this
game, and sorry for you.

434
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,160
I will be taking your flint.

435
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,260
Vati, you have one extra person.
Gonna sit somebody out.

436
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,800
- I have very little value to add.
- Who's it gonna be?

437
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,820
Again?
Daniel gonna sit out.

438
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,840
All right, Daniel, take a
spot on the sit-out bench.

439
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,420
Everybody else, give you
a minute to strategize,

440
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,700
and we'll get started.
Here we go.

441
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,900
All right, for immunity
and reward.

442
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,480
Survivors ready?

443
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,140
Go!

444
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,560
Got to get up and over
a very tall net ramp.

445
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,200
- It takes teamwork.
- Go.

446
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,320
Push my feet.

447
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,140
Got it?

448
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:17,940
- Got it.
- Okay.

449
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,080
- Lindsay's up.
- Go.

450
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,540
All three tribes working
together really well.

451
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,300
- You got it?
- Ika doing a great job.

452
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,340
Drea, wow.
Drea pulling herself up.

453
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,720
That is not easy.

454
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,940
- Roll, roll.
- I'm rolling!

455
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,920
Roll more.

456
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,820
It's Ika in the early
lead right now.

457
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,440
You're good.
Start working it.

458
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,960
- Let's go.
- You're good, start working it.

459
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,700
Gonna be Tori now
untangling the braided rope.

460
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,300
Go, Tori.

461
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,120
And Omar untangling now.

462
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,680
- There you go, baby girl.
- Vati taking a long time...

463
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,460
- ...to get over this.
- Come on.

464
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,220
- Here.
- Come on.

465
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,360
- Nothing is easy on Survivor.
- Come on.

466
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,880
- Every single step...
- You got it?

467
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,980
- You got it?
- ...you got to earn it.

468
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,340
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Come on, Vati!

469
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,340
I'm good, I'm good.

470
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,080
It's now Chanelle in on it.

471
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,640
- Tori doing a great job for Ika.
- You're almost there.

472
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,700
Once that key drops, you can
use it to unlock the machete.

473
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,300
- Tori's got the key.
- You got it, you got it, you got it, get it.

474
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,040
Unclip it.
You're good.

475
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,420
- Unclip.
- She's got the key.

476
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,120
Come on, you guys.

477
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,220
Tori's gonna also
do the machete now.

478
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,440
- Got it. Go, Rocks.
- She's got it now.

479
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,620
- She's got it.
- Go.

480
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,980
There you go, you're good!
Start getting your sandbags!

481
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,780
It is Ika still in the lead.

482
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,680
Go.

483
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,160
Omar and Chanelle
taking a long time

484
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,300
to untangle their braided rope.

485
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,860
It's gonna be Drea coming in
to fire that first slingshot.

486
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,500
Ika with a big lead right now.

487
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,980
Good one, Drea!

488
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,460
Drea, nice fire.
Just misses.

489
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Yes, yes.

490
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,540
- All right.
- Chanelle has the key.

491
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,660
- Gonna give it to Mike.
- Mike, it's right here.

492
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,640
- Mike gonna handle the machete.
- Come on, Mike, just come on.

493
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,560
Guys.

494
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,980
Tap it!
Tap it!

495
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,020
Way to go, Mike!

496
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,800
Vati's back in this now.

497
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,700
Got to get all your
sandbags in the bin.

498
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
Drea does it.
One target down for Ika.

499
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,400
- Go, Rocksroy!
- Rocksroy coming in now.

500
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,280
Left one goes up.

501
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,560
Omar still working on the ropes.

502
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,060
The one in, one in your
bottom goes to the left.

503
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,980
This is a big setback, with
Tribal Council on the line.

504
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,300
You can see it in the faces
of the tribe members watching.

505
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,900
- What is wrong?
- Keep going back.

506
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,140
Rocksroy for Ika.

507
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,620
- Just misses.
- Go! Go! Go!

508
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,300
Mike coming in now for Vati.

509
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,200
Mike all the way back,

510
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,960
- and he just misses.
- Great shot!

511
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,880
- Yup, bring down the middle.
- Okay.

512
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,280
Omar really in
trouble right now.

513
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,160
Lindsay trying to walk him
through it, Jonathan frustrated.

514
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,580
Can't even watch anymore.

515
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,620
Yup, and then one to the...
and then the one to the left.

516
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,040
It is hard to describe how
long Omar has been working.

517
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,940
So sorry, guys.

518
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,780
Somebody is going home tonight.

519
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,520
Rocksroy for the win.

520
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,880
There it is!

521
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,140
Ika wins immunity
and a large tarp.

522
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,300
Nobody going home.

523
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,020
Oh, my God.

524
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,560
We're looking for one more.

525
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,260
Immunity on the line.

526
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,780
Mike takes a big fall.

527
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,020
Bring that one
down the middle, yup.

528
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,280
And then we should have it.

529
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,580
Okay.

530
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,380
- All right.
- Now you go.

531
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,180
There you go, Taku.
Let's go!

532
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,680
Jonathan takes the key.

533
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,020
With one chop releases the bags!

534
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,540
Come on, Vati.
You got this!

535
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,100
There goes Chanelle trying
to knock down the first target.

536
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,460
Suddenly,
Taku could be back in this

537
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
because Vati has
yet to get any

538
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,960
rhythm going on the slingshot.

539
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,200
- Go, go, go, go!
- Another horrible misfire.

540
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,260
It's going to be Jonathan in.

541
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,060
And right now,
we are back at even.

542
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,240
- It is Jonathan and Mike.
- Yeah, you got this.

543
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,000
All the way back,
all the way back.

544
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,900
Jonathan knocks down
the first target for Tak

545
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,500
Right there.

546
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,240
Taku took forever to get here,
but they are back in it.

547
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,200
Mike knocks down
the first target for Vati.

548
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,360
We are tied now!

549
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,380
One target left.
Here comes Chanelle.

550
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,540
Here comes Jonathan.

551
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,220
So close, babe.

552
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,360
Just misses.
Jonathan for the win.

553
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,360
Here comes Mike.

554
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,140
And he's got it!

555
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,400
Taku wins immunity and tarps.

556
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,620
Sending Vati to Tribal Council,

557
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,960
where somebody will be
voted out of Survivor 42.

558
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,620
- Oh my God.
- Big comeback.

559
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,660
- We were so close.
- So freaking...

560
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,620
It was close.

561
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,920
Ika, nice job.
Immunity is yours.

562
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,860
Nobody going home.

563
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,840
Come grab your big tarp.

564
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,020
This thing is heavy.

565
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,340
Taku, nice comeback.
Immunity is yours again.

566
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,440
Who wants to grab the tarp?

567
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,680
Smaller, but it will get
the job done for sure.

568
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,740
Amen, Mr. Jeff.

569
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,460
- Mr. Jeff.
- Mr. Jeff.

570
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,800
Still not used to it.

571
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,880
All right, before I send
you on your way,

572
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,760
two players gonna be
taking a journey today.

573
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,960
Ika, pick somebody from
Vati to take the journey.

574
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,900
They cannot have gone
on a journey this season.

575
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,780
- Okay.
- Who you going to send?

576
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,940
Lydia.

577
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,880
All right, Lydia's gonna
go on a journey.

578
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,720
Now, one person's
gonna join her.

579
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,360
It can be from Taku, or it
can be from your tribe.

580
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,200
- Yeah, you can go.
- I'm gonna go.

581
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,740
Go for it.

582
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,900
Who's it gonna be?

583
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,940
- Rocks.
- Rocks.

584
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,540
Rocksroy and Lydia,
grab your stuff, head out.

585
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,960
You'll return back to your tribe
before Tribal Council tonight.

586
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,620
Ika, you've got the tarp.

587
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,800
Your flint will be waiting
for you back at camp.

588
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,000
Grab your stuff,
no Tribal tonight.

589
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,500
Taku, grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

590
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,700
- No Tribal Council tonight.
- Thanks, Jeff.

591
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,260
All right, Vati,
Tribal Council tonight.

592
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,600
Somebody will be
voted out of this game.

593
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,140
Before you go,
I need your flint.

594
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,720
- It's for you, Jeff.
- Thanks, Chanelle.

595
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,300
You'll have a
chance to win it back

596
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,380
at the next immunity challenge.

597
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,860
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

598
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,560
<i>I'm actually really excited
about losing today</i>

599
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,920
<i>because now I get to
kind of trim the fat.</i>

600
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,820
<i>And Chanelle and Daniel
are the fat of the tribe</i>

601
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,300
<i>because I trust them the least.</i>

602
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,600
<i>They led me on.</i>

603
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,060
<i>When they drew the tribal lines,
I knew the game was on.</i>

604
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,700
So we all know what's coming.

605
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,320
Scramble before Tribal.

606
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,280
Let's make sure
that we just remember

607
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,160
we are still a Vati family

608
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,980
at the end of
all of this, okay?

609
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,620
Yeah.

610
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,480
I had something
to say, actually.

611
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,540
So...

612
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,820
I know that my head is possibly
on the chopping block tonight.

613
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,040
I don't really want to scramble,

614
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,680
but if you're willing
to give it to me,

615
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,120
I'd love just a chance to speak
with each of you, one-on-one.

616
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,920
Dan, I don't think
that's scrambling.

617
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,760
- I think you should...
- Yeah, yeah.

618
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,900
...100% have the right
to talk to everyone.

619
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,380
Play your game, man.
Play your game.

620
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,040
I just want to add to that.
I feel like

621
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,000
my head is also
on the chopping block,

622
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,000
so if I could just talk
to each of you guys,

623
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,440
- I'd appreciate that.
- Okay.

624
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,420
Cool.
Thank you.

625
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,220
<i>Chanelle and I feel
the heat tonight.</i>

626
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,520
<i>And I was ready to go
to the end with Chanelle.</i>

627
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,360
<i>And yet we're here because
when push came to shove</i>

628
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,680
<i>she did not have my back.</i>

629
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,660
<i>So why should I trust her
going forward?</i>

630
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,260
I'm with you to the end.
That's all I have to say.

631
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,240
Out of you and Chanelle...

632
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,340
...I trust you more.

633
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,140
- Chanelle's going home.
- Yeah, yeah.

634
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,080
- Period, I don't trust her.
- Yeah.

635
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,220
I think if I get to
the merge with her,

636
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,620
she's going to flip immediately.

637
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,800
And I'm worried
she wouldn't just flip.

638
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,820
She would kind of drag us.

639
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,980
- Yes.
- Yeah.

640
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,420
<i>I think Chanelle needs to go
because I agree with Hai.</i>

641
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,140
<i>She's likely to
flip at the merge.</i>

642
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,960
<i>So if you know
someone's going to flip,</i>

643
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,900
<i>it's better to get rid
of 'em when you can</i>

644
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,660
<i>than to wait for
them to flip on you.</i>

645
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,560
So, you are a hundred percent
writing down Daniel's name?

646
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,980
He's definitely going.

647
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,020
Yeah.

648
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,300
We have to.

649
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,380
- We have to for so many reasons.
- Yeah.

650
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,420
<i>I think the consensus is,
everyone wants Daniel gone.</i>

651
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,500
Like, you are 100%
writing his name down?

652
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,460
- Absolutely.
- Great.

653
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,580
We're good.
Sold.

654
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,080
- It's a done deal.
- If everything's...

655
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,920
Daniel's go... Look at me.
Daniel's going home.

656
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,580
Got it.

657
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,520
<i>Daniel has one arm, he hasn't
competed in any challenges.</i>

658
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,920
<i>Not only that, I think people seeing
him go swimming yesterday</i>

659
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,620
<i>was also something that kind
of set them over the edge.</i>

660
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,680
I just got to make sure
he feels confident enough...

661
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,660
- ...that he doesn't play...
- ...not to shot-in-the-dark.

662
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,540
Yeah.

663
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,020
What are your thoughts?

664
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,740
Whichever one of them
goes home, I will still be able...

665
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,400
- ...to sleep a little better tonight.
- 100%.

666
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,600
- I don't... honestly?
- Yeah.

667
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,200
As long as me, you
and Lydia don't go home.

668
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,780
We really have to evaluate
which one of these two

669
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,700
will be best for us long-term.

670
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,900
They're two weasels
in a chicken coop.

671
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,060
<i>Both Daniel and Chanelle
have felt as though</i>

672
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,900
<i>they've reintegrated themselves
back into the tribe.</i>

673
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,840
<i>It's just...</i>

674
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,000
<i>not nearly enough.</i>

675
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,100
Mathematically, we're good
because now we have

676
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,860
three votes: me, you and Lydia.

677
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,940
I feel a lot better.

678
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,040
I'll do whatever you want.

679
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,480
<i>Now that Mike has his vote,</i>

680
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,920
<i>we have the majority
of the votes</i>

681
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,020
<i>between Lydia, myself and Mike</i>

682
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,880
<i>that we can split up
just in case</i>

683
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,480
<i>one of them plays a Shot
in the Dark or has an advantage.</i>

684
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,600
The main thing is, Lydia cannot
have taken that shot.

685
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,780
We need her vote.

686
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,820
<i>At this journey, it's extremely
important what Lydia does.</i>

687
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,440
<i>The main thing
that Lydia can't do,</i>

688
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,960
<i>can't do is take a chance
for an advantage.</i>

689
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,680
<i>If she loses her vote,
we are in trouble.</i>

690
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,580
Holy cow.

691
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,000
Wow.

692
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,380
We're here.

693
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,180
- We're really here.
- Wow.

694
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,680
You won't get this anywhere else.

695
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,240
Just put this in a
memory bank and hold.

696
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,120
Wow.

697
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,060
Anytime you get to a
bad place in your life,

698
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,000
- bring this up, holy moly.
- For sure.

699
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,560
<i>Survivor breaks you down, and
everything is stripped away.</i>

700
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,880
<i>I'm learning a lot about myself.</i>

701
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,520
<i>One of those things is just
being comfortable in my own skin.</i>

702
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,020
<i>I've struggled,
as most young women</i>

703
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,700
<i>and just, like,
young people in general,</i>

704
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,880
<i>struggle with body image issues.</i>

705
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,860
<i>And coming on Survivor was
a really big challenge for me,</i>

706
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,560
<i>not only just with
the elements but just, like,</i>

707
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,600
<i>you see people very
open with their bodies.</i>

708
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,440
<i>And a big source of the way
I started dressing was</i>

709
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,200
<i>just 'cause I was
trying to hide.</i>

710
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,840
<i>But you can only
be open out here.</i>

711
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,500
<i>And my body is perfect
just the way it is.</i>

712
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,100
<i>And I feel like I have gotten
more confident in it.</i>

713
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,100
<i>It's not even halfway through
the game, and I'm just, like,</i>

714
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,680
<i>I've already accomplished so much.</i>

715
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,460
There's still more to see.

716
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,820
<i>There's still more to do,
and it's just going</i>

717
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,820
<i>to keep getting more
and more beautiful.</i>

718
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,320
So who do you think
tonight's going to be...

719
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,220
- ...on the chopping block for you guys?
- For us?

720
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,720
I don't know.

721
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,140
I know, and, of course,
like, I'm not there.

722
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,560
So I'm just nervous, of course,

723
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,380
going in, you know,
that it could be me.

724
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,440
<i>Even though I am
in a decent position</i>

725
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,860
<i>going into Tribal now,
I'd mentioned I was, like,</i>

726
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,200
<i>kind of on the bottom.</i>

727
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,980
<i>I'm just meeting Rocksroy,</i>

728
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,800
<i>so I'm trying not to give too
much information about our tribe.</i>

729
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,000
So you feel as
if you're gonna...

730
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,960
you could be a potential?

731
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,140
Definitely, yeah, I was definitely
on the chopping block last time.

732
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,320
- Why?
- Um, no idea.

733
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,040
<i>My first impression of Lydia
was, she seemed more like</i>

734
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,100
<i>someone that's in trouble,
but, of course,</i>

735
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,680
<i>as I didn't, you don't want
to give your opponent</i>

736
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,660
<i>too much information.</i>

737
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,920
Are you guys all tight?

738
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,520
Uh, who is tight?

739
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,760
- You know, it's like...
- Yeah.

740
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,840
<i>I'm trying to just
get a feel for</i>

741
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,960
<i>how camp life is,
who he trusts, and</i>

742
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,600
<i>I got nothing.</i>

743
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,180
"You will now separate
and make a private decision

744
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,880
before returning to camp."

745
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,220
Hey, I'm rooting for you.

746
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,160
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
- All right? I am.

747
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,340
<i>Rocksroy was being very cagey.</i>

748
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,320
<i>And I feel like I was as well.</i>

749
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,260
<i>I think we both wanted
to protect our tribe.</i>

750
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,060
<i>Because we don't know where
we're headed to in this game.</i>

751
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,540
"Protect your vote."

752
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,060
"Risk your vote."

753
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,680
"Here's how it works."

754
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,520
If Lydia and I both pick
"risk your vote,"

755
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,300
then we both lose our vote
at the next Tribal Council.

756
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,160
If Lydia and I say "protect our
vote," then nothing changes

757
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,240
and we're able to vote
at the next Tribal Council.

758
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,980
But if Lydia says
"protect her vote"

759
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,620
and I choose "risk your vote,"
then Lydia remains the same;

760
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,680
me, I receive an extra vote.

761
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,980
I feel like as if
I should risk my vote.

762
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,820
But speaking with Lydia,
seems as if

763
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,280
she's on the bottom of
the totem pole in her tribe.

764
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,620
I think she's gonna risk it
for the biscuit.

765
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,860
An opportunity like this
definitely doesn't come...

766
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,080
very often.

767
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,160
Having an advantage in this
game is just so important.

768
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,520
Coming from Vegas,
don't gamble often,

769
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,640
but when I do, I know that when
I'm up on the house, walk away.

770
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,240
So I'm gonna use my brain...

771
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,440
...and I'm gonna
protect my vote.

772
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,980
It is so hard to get
advantages in the game,

773
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,460
but I think it scares me
more to not have a vote

774
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,880
going into a really
important Tribal.

775
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,310
Lydia!

776
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,960
- Welcome back.
- Welcome home party.

777
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,540
<i>I'm very glad that
I protected my vote.</i>

778
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,060
<i>If circumstances were
different, I definitely think</i>

779
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,280
<i>I might have risked it
for my own personal gain.</i>

780
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,560
The same thing as Jenny said,
you go to a wheel,

781
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,180
risk your vote,
protect your vote.

782
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,940
- I protected my vote.
- Nice.

783
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,200
<i>But we're not in individual yet.</i>

784
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,560
<i>We're going to Tribal
tonight as a tribe,</i>

785
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,080
<i>and I just don't feel
comfortable giving away</i>

786
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,200
<i>the most important thing
I have in this game.</i>

787
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,060
I'm gonna go down to the beach,
and wash my feet off,

788
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,820
if anybody wants
to come with me.

789
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,900
<i>But now I really want to
touch base with everyone</i>

790
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,260
<i>to give me a rundown
of what happened at camp.</i>

791
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,640
How are you feeling
about tonight?

792
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,600
I'm okay.

793
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Yeah, Mike is like, "I'm writing
Daniel's name down."

794
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,920
You know he's got his vote back now?

795
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,580
Yes, I guess.

796
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,820
I feel good.

797
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,540
Like, I was like...

798
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,460
If anything...

799
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,000
I trust you and Hai.

800
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,140
Yeah, no, you absolutely
can trust us.

801
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,240
I'm sorry that I voted for you.

802
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,900
- It was a mistake.
- Yeah.

803
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,800
I'm totally with you
going forward.

804
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,140
To be totally honest, I think
you are the queenmaker.

805
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,020
You and Hai...

806
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,740
...are deciding,

807
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,980
and I think Chanelle and I
are probably on the block.

808
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,020
<i>Daniel and Chanelle,definitely,
they're very nervous,</i>

809
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,440
<i>but they both think it's
the other person going home.</i>

810
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,780
<i>Chanelle, I don't fully trust her,</i>

811
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,940
<i>and Daniel is a liability.</i>

812
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,240
<i>And at our last Tribal Council,
he was trying to get me out.</i>

813
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,620
<i>But clearly, me and Hai</i>

814
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,140
<i>are definitely running this vote.</i>

815
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,280
So here's the recap.
I've talked to everyone.

816
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,300
Mike is 100 on board.

817
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,180
- Daniel is voting Chanelle.
- For sure.

818
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,820
<i>Lydia gets back,
and I have to scramble</i>

819
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,740
<i>to get some alone time with her,</i>

820
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,860
<i>because we are about
to head to Tribal immediately.</i>

821
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,960
I know 100% that
Daniel is comfortable.

822
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,240
It's not you.
It's between Daniel, Chanelle.

823
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,400
So that's where it stands.

824
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,980
- As long as it's not me.
- It's not you.

825
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,820
It's not us, we just have
to stick to the plan.

826
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,260
<i>The merge is coming up
any day now,</i>

827
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,400
<i>so tonight's Tribal
Council is monumental</i>

828
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,260
<i>because not only does it
affect the rest of my game,</i>

829
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,220
<i>it's going to affect how
the merge is going to play out.</i>

830
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,360
<i>I'm just nervous because</i>

831
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,520
<i>whether it be Chanelle or Daniel</i>

832
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,300
<i>that goes into
the merge with me</i>

833
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:28,020
<i>will determine how
well I do in this game.</i>

834
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,560
All right.

835
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,540
Mike, give me an analogy

836
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,080
from your world
that you come from

837
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,540
that captures where
this tribe is at.

838
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,640
You know, Jeff, once in a while,
when I was a fireman,

839
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,560
somebody on the crew
maybe didn't do something

840
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,760
that they should have did,

841
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,560
but that didn't mean
we didn't stick together.

842
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,920
As with this tribe, tonight

843
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,480
we're gonna lose
a member of our tribe,

844
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,620
but it doesn't mean
that we're not solid.

845
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,060
Daniel, what do you
read into that?

846
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,520
Mike is a straight shooter.

847
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,640
Mike, to his core,
is a team guy.

848
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,140
Some people come
into this game,

849
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,740
and from the get-go, they're
playing an individual game.

850
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,080
And I don't think you can
win Survivor doing that.

851
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,140
And Mike is not
one of those people.

852
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,980
So then, Hai, how do you
vote somebody out

853
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,040
if Mike's story is accurate?

854
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,140
Which is, we're just
one firehouse,

855
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,360
but somebody's got to go.

856
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,030
Yeah, this game is hard.

857
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,400
I see five autonomous
players here

858
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,320
who all have the goal
of getting to the end.

859
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,820
So unfortunately someone
here is being lied to,

860
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,200
or multiple people.

861
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,240
Daniel, let's go with Hai's idea

862
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,860
that somebody's being lied to.

863
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,900
Give me an analogy
from your world...

864
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,020
- Oh, geez.
- ...where lying is fun.

865
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,120
It's part of it.

866
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,480
I should be honest with you, Jeff,

867
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,700
I'm not an analogy guy.

868
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,260
But, sorry, can I jump back
on the Mike thing?

869
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,360
- Yeah.
- When he talks about teams,

870
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,860
he's not talking about
teams just in Survivor.

871
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,140
I think Mike sees this as a team
for, like, the rest of his life.

872
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,940
And by that I mean
the very end.

873
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,130
That's true.

874
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,180
Wait, when you said
"to the very end,"

875
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,460
- ...you mean until you are dying.
- Yeah, I think, I think,

876
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,740
I think, like, hopefully
I live longer than Mike.

877
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,240
- Um...
- It's a very good possibility.

878
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:30,940
Yeah.

879
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,320
Yeah, but, like, I feel like
Mike and I will probably,

880
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,620
you know, be friends to the
very end of whoever goes first.

881
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,760
Knock on wood it's not me.

882
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,600
Mike's 117, so we don't know
how much longer he has.

883
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,600
- 116.
- Yeah.

884
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,100
- 116.
- Yeah.

885
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,000
Jeff, I actually want to
jump in because I think that,

886
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,320
like, the two different themes
that you're noting.

887
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,080
Friendship and then
the game of Survivor

888
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,120
I think we're seeing it
come to play, like,

889
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,240
right here in front of us.

890
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,960
Because Daniel's comment right
there is him playing the game,

891
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,940
playing to Mike's
soft spot, his heart.

892
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,320
Let me just go and pat
Mike on the back again.

893
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,440
Team, friendship.

894
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,460
And so, like, that's playing
the game right there.

895
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,080
It's almost kind of
milking it a bit.

896
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,140
Daniel, that was pretty clear.

897
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,410
She doesn't buy it.

898
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,500
You might mean it,
but right now

899
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,380
you're saying it
because you're at Tribal.

900
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,180
I didn't mean any game strategy
by that, to be totally honest.

901
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,000
I try to be as
genuine as possible.

902
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,100
Like, there are things
that I could have kept secret.

903
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,020
I mean, I'm a leukemia survivor.

904
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,660
I could have kept that secret,

905
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,400
but I cannot play this game
without being true to who I am.

906
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,480
And, yes, you have to
lie sometimes and stuff,

907
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,340
but I analogize that to, like...

908
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,060
I have an analogy, actually.
Yes.

909
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,500
Okay, I analogize that
to boxing.

910
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,860
You know, like, Muhammad Ali

911
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,760
was one of the best boxers
in the entire world.

912
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,940
He didn't go down the street
punching random people.

913
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,580
He only punched people
when he was boxing.

914
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,620
Right?, so when we're
playing Survivor, we lie,

915
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,310
but in our real lives,
we don't lie.

916
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,720
It's just, like,
part of the game.

917
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,020
So, Lydia, then what
would a vote

918
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,300
be based on tonight
with this tribe?

919
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,620
What are some of the criteria
that might come up?

920
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,460
You know, after tonight,

921
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,520
each tribe is gonna be
four, four and four.

922
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,020
And so no one
has numbers, you know?

923
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,780
And we're speculating a merge,
you know, coming up.

924
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,340
Hopefully soon.

925
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,920
- Please.
- We've been talking about that feast.

926
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,560
Even if it was rice, we're like:
"All right, we'll take it."

927
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,740
So I think one of
the criteria is, like,

928
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,600
who can I trust the most
going forward?

929
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,740
Especially in a game where
the numbers are not obvious.

930
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,740
All right, so, Hai, for Lydia,
she's saying it's trust.

931
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,060
- Yeah.
- How about for you?

932
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,360
100%, trust is the most
valuable currency out here.

933
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,200
If you look back at
the last Tribal we were at...

934
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,620
...there were six blindsides.

935
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,060
And when trust is broken,
it's very hard to win back.

936
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,840
So for me, it's about
establishing trust,

937
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,540
'cause I want to
make it to the end.

938
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,900
- Daniel, you're nodding.
- I mean, unless you're...

939
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,260
one of the greatest
players ever, and I'm not one,

940
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,120
you get burned at least once.

941
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,160
You have to be able
to look past the burn,

942
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,940
and sometimes, when you were
the one who did the burning,

943
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,200
ask for forgiveness.

944
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,340
If you can't do that,

945
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,180
I think you're gonna play
a short Survivor game.

946
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,780
Chanelle, if you're
keeping the people

947
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,200
that are most trustworthy,
then the person

948
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,480
you're getting rid of has
to be the least trustworthy.

949
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,520
Uh, I think that's what
someone reasonable would deduct

950
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,320
from what we're
hearing, so, yes.

951
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,040
Wow, is it hard for you
to answer that question?

952
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,680
No, I mean, the
writing's on the wall.

953
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,680
Like, a reasonable
conclusion would be that

954
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,060
if we are voting based on trust,
the person who is voted out

955
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,160
is ultimately not
high in that category,

956
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,380
the least trustworthy.

957
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,820
And, Mike, you do have
to make those decisions.

958
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,640
It doesn't mean,
to your point earlier,

959
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,180
that you might not like
this person personally,

960
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,580
but in this game it's
just not my best move.

961
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,600
My vote tonight
is strictly gameplay.

962
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,200
Has nothing to do with
how I personally feel at all.

963
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,980
I want to be friends
with whoever gets voted off

964
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,340
here tonight for
the rest of my life.

965
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,080
Sometimes it's hard
to play Survivor

966
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,300
in the way you want to play it.

967
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,500
Tonight I'm playing Survivor.

968
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,020
Okay, it is time to vote.
Mike, you're up.

969
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,510
If anybody has an
advantage or an idol

970
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,860
and you want to play it, now
would be the time to do so.

971
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,800
Okay, I'll read the votes.

972
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,880
First vote...

973
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,380
Chanelle.

974
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,080
Daniel.

975
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,520
Chanelle.
Two votes Chanelle.

976
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,240
Daniel.
We're tied.

977
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,000
Two votes Chanelle,
two votes Daniel,

978
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,380
one vote left.

979
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,100
Mike.

980
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,520
We have a tie.

981
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,300
Two votes for Chanelle,
two votes for Daniel.

982
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,540
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna revote.

983
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,460
You can only vote
for Daniel or Chanelle.

984
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,440
Daniel and Chanelle,

985
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,660
you can only vote for
each other, so you won't vote.

986
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,300
Mike, if you want
to come grab the urn.

987
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,640
I'll read the votes.

988
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,540
First vote...

989
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,680
Daniel.

990
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,520
Sixth person voted
out of Survivor 42.

991
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,960
Daniel, that's two.
That's enough.

992
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,220
You need to bring me your torch.

993
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,940
Well played, guys.

994
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,960
Love you, Dan.

995
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,860
- Bye, Dan.
- Bye, Dan.

996
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,220
All right, it's only
once in a lifetime.

997
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,300
I'm going to enjoy this.

998
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,680
Here we go, Jeff.

999
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,640
Daniel, the tribe has spoken.

1000
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,980
The tribe has spoken.

1001
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:28,680
Time for you to go.

1002
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,080
Bye, Dan.

1003
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,760
Man, that's heartbreaking.

1004
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,500
I kept my promise.

1005
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,000
Somebody voted for me.

1006
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,400
Grab your torches, head back
to camp, good night.

1007
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,360
<i>Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.</i>

1008
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,120
<i>Next time on a two-hour episode of Survivor...</i>

1009
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,920
Everybody drop your buffs.

1010
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,320
Oh, my God!

1011
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,780
So, is this called the merge?

1012
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,200
Not exactly.

1013
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,860
This is the biggest moment
in the game so far.

1014
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,320
It is going to be just chaos.

1015
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,600
I'm gonna keep fighting
in this game till I'm dead.

1016
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,360
<i>I got totally blindsided, I would
have preferred to execute</i>

1017
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,880
<i>the blindside, but at least
I got a form of blindside.</i>

1018
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,520
<i>That's part of the
Survivor experience.</i>

1019
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,000
<i>If I could have
scripted my life,</i>

1020
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,440
<i>I probably wouldn't have
given myself leukemia, right?</i>

1021
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,340
<i>And if I could
have scripted Survivor,</i>

1022
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,380
<i>I probably would
have had myself winning,</i>

1023
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,040
<i>but the beauty of life
is that it's unscripted.</i>

1024
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,800
<i>That's how we find
meaning in it.</i>
