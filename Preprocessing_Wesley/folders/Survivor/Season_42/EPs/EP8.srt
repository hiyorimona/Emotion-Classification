go right in the middle.

149

Maryanne, you drew the gray,

150
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,218
which means
you're not competing.

151
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,787

-PROBST: So, wait.

So, Drea, you're saying you want
to switch with Maryanne?

Yeah, I don't like
peanut butter and jelly,

a minute to strategize.

163
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,316
Drea, you'll take a spot
on the bench. Let's do this!

00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,909
-for four days?
-You said start the negotiation.

502
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,144
You said negotiate.

503
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,379
All right. Nine.

504
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,947
-Nine?
-Nine?
-Nine?

505
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,815
-No.
-CHANELLE: It's a nonstarter.

506
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,150
-It's a nonstarter.
-OMAR: Four.

507
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,351
So is two.

508
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,552
-Two.
-Three.
-Four.

509
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,553
-Three.
-Three.
-Three.

510
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,123
Here's why I think six
is a fair number.

511
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,091
-(sighs)
-PROBST: Just hear me out.

512
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,828
Six is a fair number because
it is more than half the tribe.

513
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,430
(scoffs)

514
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,465
-Who wants to sit out,
first of all?
-I'll sit out.

515
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,735
Nobody wants to, but I will
for rice, 'cause I need to eat.

516
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,304
So there's two--
Lindsay and Drea.

517
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,472
MIKE:
I'm not sitting out.

518
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,175
I came here to play,
and so I want to play.

519
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,743
Why don't we do five?

520
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,845
No, look, five. Let's go four.

521
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,647
-Well, okay, meet us at four.
-MIKE: Meet us at four.

522
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,848
Who are the four?

523
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,851
I know I'm not good
at this challenge,

524
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,420
-and I know there's
a bunch of people here...
-I could be one.

525
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,521
-...who have not eaten.
-MIKE: All right, we got,

526
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,522
-we got three.
-JONATHAN: That's three.

527
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,790
-PROBST: There's three.
-MIKE: One more.

528
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,358
PROBST:
One more, and we got a deal.

529
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,360
-I'll take four.
-JONATHAN: Take four.

530
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,062
(sighs)

531
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,330
-Come on, guys.
-MIKE: Let's h...

532
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,932
Hey, guys, get in the middle
here. Let's get in the middle.

533
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,735
Like, I obviously,
I want to compete.

534
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:17,736
Like, I want to compete,

535
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,771
but the thing is, like,
we all need food.

536
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,573
And it's like, I know that
there's some people here

537
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,742
who know that they're
in a better position than me.

538
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,744
So, like, it would mean so much,

539
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,046
if you know that you're
in that better position,

540
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,881
to go and, like,
sacrifice, 'cause it's, like,

541
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,650
I could be going home
because of this decision.

542
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,819
But to know that
I'm giving a chance

543
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,221
for you guys to move
forward, like, please.

544
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,023
Just, like, in your heart,
just do it, please.

545
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,257
Like, I'm begging you.

546
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,028
I'll do it.

547
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,696
-JONATHAN: All right, Omar.
-You'll sit out?

548
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,698
-MARYANNE: Thank you, Omar.
-MIKE: That's four.
We have four.

549
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:47,766
-Are you sure?
-(groaning)

550
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,101
MIKE:
Thank you. Omar.
You got my word.

551
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,602
MARYANNE:
Thanks, Omar.

552
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,537
<i>I decided to go and sit out.</i>

553
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,006
And, you know, I'm an emotional
person, and I'm tearing up,

554
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,076
<i>I'm getting sad, and I'm really</i>
<i>trying to ramp it up--</i>

555
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,745
<i>making people feel bad</i>
<i>about trying to vote me out.</i>

556
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,881
<i>And hopefully,</i>
<i>I'll be able to see another day.</i>

557
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,017
People say you can't
play this game with emotion,

558
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,820
but look at me,
using emotions as a weapon.

559
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,955
(laughs softly)

560
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,858
All right, Lindsay,
Maryanne, Drea, Omar,

561
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,059
-take a spot
on the sit-out bench.
-MIKE: Thank you.

-TORI: Thanks, guys.

564
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,731

-MIKE: Thank you, Drea.

566
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,235
Could be longer
if you handle it well.

567

JONATHAN:

-PROBST: All right,
everybody else,

571
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,076
we're gonna draw for spots.

572
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,778
We'll get started. Here we go.

00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,719
All right, here we go.

575
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,687
Everybody get up on your beam.

576
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,257
That's the first part of this.
You're gonna balance

577
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,259
on that beam,
and I'm gonna count you in.

578
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,995
You're gonna put your handles
into the buoy and lift it off.

579

And this challenge is on.

583
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,041
And immediately
Hai is out and frustrated.

584
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,477
Everybody else
gets a good setup,

585
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,012
and we are going.

586
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,280
Hai is first out.

587
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,415
Lasted about a second.

588
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,784
-That happens.
-(Maryanne and Hai chuckle)

589
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,755
Jonathan with a nice recovery.

590
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,991
You have got to
concentrate in this challenge.

591
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,095
It will get you fast,
as it just did Rocksroy.

592
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,103
Mike is out, and we're
down to four very quickly.

593

We're down to three.

Chanelle and Tori on one end.

Jonathan alone at the other end.

596
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,883
Tori won the first
individual immunity.

597
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,252

she drops.

610
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,036
And we're down to two.

611
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,640
We have a showdown
between Tori and Jonathan.

Now it's Tori with
a little bit of a wobble.

617

Tori continues
to adjust those toes.

618

You got to
get it back in control.

619

00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,367
<i>And it was so necessary,</i>

670
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,369
because I was desperate
at this point.

671
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,972
My body was running on fumes
and memories of food.

672
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,774
-Good job, Tori.
-Thank you.
-MIKE: Great job.

673
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,444
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>Good for Tori,</i>
<i>because she was our main target.</i>

674
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,145
<i>And now that Tori is safe,</i>

675
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,914
that leaves our options
for tonight's Tribal

676
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,084
<i>as Chanelle, Romeo, Maryanne.</i>

677
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,385
LINDSAY:
We need to eat. This is...

678
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,986
JONATHAN:
Do you want to go ahead
and start cooking some?

679
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,855
I'll help.
I'm gonna get some wood.

680
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,323
MIKE:
I'm gonna get some wood, too.

681
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,225
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>However, Chanelle has proven</i>

682
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,128
<i>that she's not loyal</i>
<i>to me and Mike.</i>

683
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,098
<i>So Chanelle is our plan</i>
<i>going into Tribal tonight.</i>

684
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,566
MIKE:
Everybody knows the plan, right?

685
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:55,633
It's Chanelle.

686
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,240
It's personal for me
with Chanelle.

687
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,676
-Chanelle.
-Okay, so then
I'll go with you guys.

688
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:06,444
You gave me your word. I-I'm...

689
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,745
-Look at me.
-Yeah.

690
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,214
-It's not you.
<i>-Chanelle has been</i>

691
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,616
truly, truly unloyal to me.

692
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,151
(indistinct chatter)

693
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,686
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>She voted for me</i>
<i>when she didn't have to.</i>

694
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:17,956
So, bye-bye, Chanelle.

695
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:22,994
CHANELLE:
Okay.

696
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,730
Okay.

697
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,533
-(clicks tongue)
<i>-Chanelle is the actual vote.</i>

698
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,403
<i>However,</i>
<i>we told Chanelle to vote Romeo,</i>

699
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,806
<i>because if she has an idol,</i>

700
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,041
<i>or potentially plays</i>
<i>her Shot in the Dark,</i>

701
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,443
our plan is screwed.

702
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,514
<i>CHANELLE:</i>
<i>So I'm a little nervous.</i>
<i>However,</i>

703
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,016
<i>my initial reaction</i>
<i>is just play it cool.</i>

704
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,718
<i>Let targets emerge</i>
<i>on themselves.</i>

705
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:48,186
<i>I think when you start</i>
<i>pulling a bunch of people,</i>

706
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,421
<i>people notice, people start</i>
<i>to think you're scrambling.</i>

707
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:53,291
So my plan tonight
is to vote Romeo.

708
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,460
ROCKSROY:
Maryanne, that was
very inspiring, what you said.

709
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,461
OTHERS:
Yeah.

710
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,497
<i>ROMEO:</i>
<i>This new merged Kula Kula tribe</i>

711
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,633
<i>is the kumbaya tribe,</i>
<i>and they want to sit around</i>

712
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,234
<i>the fire</i>
<i>and tell campsite stories.</i>

713
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:07,238
<i>And usually, when you don't have</i>
<i>an immunity necklace</i>

714
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,307
<i>around your neck,</i>
<i>you are worried.</i>

715
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:16,581
<i>Chanelle's super calm,</i>
<i>super chill, very quiet.</i>

716
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,517
<i>Me, I'm starting to panic.</i>

717
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,554
<i>I'm seeing what's going on.</i>
<i>I was left out of last vote.</i>

718
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,722
I was blindsided.
I could be blindsided today.

719
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,827
<i>And I thought I had</i>
<i>alliances with Drea and Rocks,</i>

720
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,996
but Drea doesn't
even look at me anymore.

721
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,131
She hasn't even talked to me.

722
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,066
I'm worried because
you and I haven't talked.

723
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,435
You don't even look at me.

724
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,736
DREA:
You are so paranoid right now.

725
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:39,804
I...

726
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,443
<i>ROMEO:</i>
<i>I don't care how many</i>
<i>people tell me</i>

727
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,346
<i>they haven't heard my name,</i>
<i>or this person's going home.</i>

728
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,549
I have to assume
that I could go home.

729
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,452
Um... Yeah.

730
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,520
So you have to...

731
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,226
-From whom?
-Uh, I don't know.

732
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,460
I don't know.
I don't know who said that,

733
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,795
but it's just...

734
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,663
There's talk going around
the campfire, I guess.

735
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,633
Tori's telling me
that you told her

736
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,337
that you heard
Chanelle, Maryanne and my name.

737
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,472
ROCKSROY:
Tori asked me
whose name have I heard.

738
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,408
And I said Maryanne
and your name.

739
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:21,713
Rocks told her that
he heard Maryanne, Chanelle,

740
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,549
and the only other name
he had ever heard was mine.

741
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,917
-Rocks told Tori that?
-Yeah.

742
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,518
I heard Maryanne
and, uh, Chanelle.

743
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,255
The outliers
think I'm an outsider,

744
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,757
but I'm well within
the majority group.

745
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,192
<i>And because of that, I acquired</i>

746
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,927
<i>information</i>
<i>that's gonna be invaluable.</i>

747
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,297
Romeo is so paranoid.

748
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,370
At this point, the vote
was supposed to be Chanelle.

749
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,804
Everybody was on the same page.

750
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,306
-We'll figure it out.
-Okay.

751
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,276
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>But Romeo has now</i>
<i>inserted himself as a target,</i>

752
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,544
and he is gonna
play himself out of the game.

753
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,454
What the...?

754
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,556
What?

755
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,364
'Cause this is ridiculous.

756
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,605
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>Within the last 30 minutes</i>
<i>before heading out to Tribal,</i>

757
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,207
<i>Romeo got a hint that his name</i>
<i>was being thrown around,</i>

758
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,343
<i>and he is stirring up chaos.</i>

759
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,612
<i>And when someone</i>
<i>is creating chaos,</i>

760
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,682
<i>that's hard for me</i>
<i>to control my environment.</i>

761
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:31,783
And I don't like that.

762
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,601
Okay.

763
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,805
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>I'm very confused</i>
<i>about Romeo's strategy,</i>

764
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,808
<i>because he is just</i>
<i>pulling people left and right,</i>

765
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:58,376
<i>having personal conversations.</i>

766
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,245
And he was
genuinely safe tonight.

767
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,848
We need to go Romeo, because
I know we want Chanelle...

768
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,250
-No.
-HAI: Romeo is creating chaos.

769
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,353
-Romeo is dangerous.
-I told you.

770
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,488
-We need to get Romeo tonight.
-Yeah, he's been paranoid
like a bitch.

771
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,523
HAI:
We need six on Romeo.

772
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,959
I just told Jonathan, Omar,

773
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,261
you, me, Mike and Lindsay.

774
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,496
-That's six. Done.
-DREA: Okay.

775
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,131
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Paranoia's a crazy thing.</i>

776
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,966
<i>Hai panicked</i>
<i>because he heard something</i>

777
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,102
<i>and wanted to change the plan.</i>
<i>But quite frankly,</i>

778
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,438
<i>there's nothing more that I want</i>
<i>is for Chanelle to go home.</i>

779
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,674
I trusted her
the first three days we're here.

780
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,843
She immediately stabbed me back.
She's been playing everybody.

781
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:32,944
She plays me.

782
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,379
Where I come from,
she's a snake.

783
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,880
I'm sticking with the plan.
I don't care.

784
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,382
-Okay?
-Someone wants to change it?

785
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,083
No, no, no. I'm saying...
No, no.

786
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,618
Nobody's changing it. That's
what I'm trying to tell you.

787
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,786
-Nobody's changing anything.
-All right, because...

788
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,321
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I'm not a brain surgeon.</i>

789
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,556
I don't know calculus.
I don't... but I'm street-smart.

790
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:46,991
Are you voting Romeo now?

791
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,427
I'm asking you.

<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>My social game</i>
<i>is really, really good.</i>

793
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,231
We have... Rocksroy's
not changing his vote.

794
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,732
<i>And it comes natural to me,</i>

795
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,835
<i>just like Jonathan's</i>
<i>strength and athletic ability</i>

796
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,737
<i>-comes natural to him.</i>
-This is gonna mess up
our plans.

797
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:00,738
Of course.

798
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,440
<i>So I'm gonna convince</i>
<i>my alliance</i>

799
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,808
<i>we can't change the plan</i>

800
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,777
<i>and that it's the right decision</i>

801
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,612
for our core alliance
at this moment.

802
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,880
Because Rocksroy's
not gonna trust us.

803
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,182
It sounds like
he doesn't trust us now.

804
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,551
Chanelle's been calm all day.
Romeo's listening.

<i>If he's willing to do that,</i>
<i>even though we gave him a name,</i>

<i>-MIKE: Good.</i>

So, Jonathan,

820
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,214
first question I have,
was there any discussion

821
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,550
that the four people
that volunteered to sit out--

822
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,754
Maryanne, Omar, Lindsay
and Drea-- were off-limits?

823
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,557
Yeah, I made it clear
that I will not vote

824
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,794
any of you guys tonight,
because what they did

825
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,129
helped us a lot.
I already feel better, Mr. Jeff.

826
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,931
I feel like
I got some life back into me.

827
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,167
Wow. Tori, you are safe.

828
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,503
-Nobody can vote you out
with that necklace.
-True.

829
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,539
This is the second time you
could look back a little bit.

830
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,008
Was this different than
the last Tribal Council?

831
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,377
It-it of course is
a little different, but it feels

832
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,679
as people are really
wanting to go with the group.

833
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,515
Like, last Tribal,
I was not part of the group,

834
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,783
and that didn't feel good, and I
had this, and I have this again,

835
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,485
but I still want
to be part of the group.

836
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,287
So that's kind of
what I was feeling.

837
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,290
You just wanted to be in
on the note, whatever it was.

838
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,791
PROBST:
Romeo, how would you describe

839
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,426
what was going on at camp
this afternoon?

840
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,997
I think so far,
since, uh, Kula Kula was formed,

841
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,333
everybody seems to be
a unified group.

842
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,336
And the majority comes up with
"hey, this person,"

843
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,906
and everybody wants to be part
of the majority, like Tori said.

844
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,308
But what's gonna be
interesting is that

845
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,076
this can't last forever,
and it won't.

846
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:22,346
PROBST:
Hai, Romeo says
it's a unified group

847
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:23,881
and we all agree on
who to vote for.

848
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,384
-But then it isn't
a unified group.
-HAI: Yeah.

849
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,818
We all think
there's a unified group,

850
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,354
but obviously
someone's out of the group.

851
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,623
Several people
may be out of the group.

852
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,359
And I think it's
all based on perception.

853
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,428
If you're going around
being suspicious

854
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:40,765
and paranoid and
spreading this information,

855
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,600
you're more than
likely not in the group.

856
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,871
PROBST:
Drea, that's very interesting,
because what Hai is saying is,

857
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,773
"Yeah, we're voting
somebody out,

858
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,274
"but I'm more concerned about

859
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,310
"who I'm going to be
voting with in the future.

860
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,379
"From the standpoint of:
can I rely on you to be calm?

861
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,881
"You're talking too much.

862
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,549
Your tell is obvious."

863
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:02,286
DREA:
It's really scary because
you align yourself with people,

864
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,854
and what they do
can be detrimental

865
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,122
to your own personal game,

866
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,391
depending on
how they act around others.

867
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,061
And you can try to do
everything you can to save them,

868
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:13,097
but, you know,
we only met 16 days ago,

869
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,198
when you think about it.

870
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,234
So, it's like, I could
totally hear my mama saying,

871
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,836
"That ain't your family, Drea."

872
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,740
Chanelle, do you think
everybody here is equally good

873
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,610
at reading their own tell
and others?

874
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:26,611
No.

875
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,979
The answer is no,

876
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,880
because if everyone
was equally as good,

877
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,148
I think everyone would
be on the same page--

878
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,149
which we're not tonight.

879
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,918
And the reason I say
we're not tonight

880
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:34,952
is because someone's going home,

881
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,754
and someone probably
doesn't know it.

882
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,556
Or maybe
multiple people don't know.

883
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,491
PROBST:
And, Mike,
when you're back home,

884
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,527
is this part of your life,
having to read people?

885
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,230
Or is this something
you're having to sort of learn?

886
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:49,734
I take pride in reading people,
'cause the truth is,

887
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,469
there are a lot of
good liars in this world.

888
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,971
You don't know
who's lying or not.

889
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,607
To me, it's trust and gut,
and that is what you have to do.

890
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,109
You have to realize
they're giving those tells.

891
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,144
That's what it's all about
on<i> Survivor.</i>

892
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,814
PROBST:
So, Romeo, it sounds like it's
the beginning of a road trip.

893
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,983
And whoever this group is,

894
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,886
they're deciding we've got room
for this many people.

895
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,621
Who do we want
to take this road trip with

896
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,757
over these last days
of<i> Survivor?</i>

897
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,458
Yes, and the next coming days,

898
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,027
I think that will
become more apparent.

899
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,896
But right now
some people don't realize

900
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,598
that some of the other people,

901
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,233
even if they're not constantly
hanging out with someone

902
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,401
or talking to somebody,

903
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,569
doesn't mean that there's
not an alliance there.

904
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,773
PROBST:
So, Chanelle, if we go
with this car analogy,

905
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,276
when you open the car door,
and you decide to get in,

906
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,378
how confident are you

907
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,581
that you're in the right
automobile for tonight?

908
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,750
I hope I'm in the right
automobile for tonight,

909
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,119
but when you're
at Tribal Council,

910
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,121
and you don't have the necklace
that Tori has,

911
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,656
you can't
really ever be certain.

912
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,658
All you can do
is trust your gut.

913
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:48,926
MARYANNE:
And sometimes you're not even
in the car, right?

914
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,628
So the car has four seats,

915
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,662
and you're, like, the fifth,
and you're, like...

916
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,830
(grunting)

917
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,532
...at the back of the car.
And you don't want that.

918
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,301
You know? 'Cause that means
you chose the wrong car.

919
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,537
PROBST:
Lindsay, if you were
gonna be in this car,

920
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,605
do you want
to be behind the steering wheel?

921
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,175
Do you want to be passenger?
Do you want to be in the back?

922
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,178
Uh, I think that answer changes
throughout the game,

923
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,447
because there's times
that it's, like,

924
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,648
you want to be
in the driver's seat.

925
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,249
And then there's other times
you're like, "You know what?

926
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,518
-Passenger's fine."
We're still gonna get there.
-(Drea laughs)

927
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,853
I don't need to be
the one driving the whole time.

928
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,854
Might want to take a nap.

929
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,022
HAI:
Can I add in?

930
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,024
-Yeah.
-If you're
in the driver position,

931
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,927
you need to know when
to let someone else drive.

932
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,563
And if you don't know
how to let someone else drive,

933
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,164
you better be wearing
a seat belt.
