2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,200
As hard as last night was,
I think we're in a good spot.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,300
- Me too.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,060
And, like, I don't think
everyone's as close as we are.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,320
<i>I'm happy that Tribal went
exactly how we planned it to go.</i>

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,420
<i>Me, Omar, Jonathan and Maryanne</i>

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,260
<i>all voted together, and that
made me feel really good.</i>

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,420
<i>Because ultimately, that
was our main plan</i>

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,600
<i>was for the four of
us to really stay tight.</i>

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,980
This morning: idol hunt.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,740
Then after, like, we can
clear the camp ash.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,820
That sounds like a good game plan.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,380
<i>But last night, Maryanne told
us she has an extra vote.</i>

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,240
Thank you, God.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,400
Although we have four...

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,760
it's like we've got five!

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,340
<i>I'm on the fence
about how I feel</i>

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,640
<i>about Maryanne
and the extra vote,</i>

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,100
<i>but if we stay at a
tight four, hopefully</i>

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,640
<i>that's for all of our advantage.</i>

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,640
You think in here is a place?

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,040
It's not a bad spot
'cause all through there

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,180
are all those little roots.

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,560
...and lots of spiders.

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,420
Spiderweb!
I think not.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,560
<i>I've watched every season,</i>

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,660
<i>except for six episodes of Tocantins.</i>

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
<i>So looking for the idol...</i>

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,860
<i>I know this thing
would be hard to find.</i>

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,780
- What happened?
- A bug.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,120
<i>So, like, I'm looking at
the nooks and crannies.</i>

32
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,160
<i>Let me dig here.
What about that hole?</i>

33
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,080
<i>Let me dig there.</i>

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,920
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,420
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,180
- Where was it?
- Just only there.

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,400
<i>My heart started pounding.</i>

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,160
<i>I'm, like, freaking out.
I'm like: "Oh, my gosh.</i>

39
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>Did I just do it?
Did I just find an idol?"</i>

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,580
"Beware Advantage.
If you take it, it's yours,

41
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,760
and you must do what it says.
Otherwise, leave it."

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,720
<i>I saw "beware" and a risk,
and I'm like:</i>

43
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,460
<i>"Oh, my goodness,
do I want to take this?"</i>

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,540
<i>Because it could
bite me in the butt.</i>

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,780
God.
I'm just scared.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,280
<i>But I would rather take the
risk and go down in flames</i>

47
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,200
<i>then let my own
hesitancy be the thing</i>

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,360
<i>that gets me out of this game.</i>

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,760
I'll do it.
Oh, my God,

50
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,780
I'm so scared.

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,640
<i>And the first thing I see</i>

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,680
<i>is what every single
person wants to see.</i>

53
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,680
"Congratulations..."

54
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,440
"you have found a three-way
shared immunity idol."

55
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,340
Wow.

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,060
<i>But then I look at the
paper a little bit more.</i>

57
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,880
"At the next inmmunity challenge..."

58
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,680
"you must say a secret phrase
in front of the other players."

59
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,280
Oh, my God.
"Your phrase..."

60
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,500
"It's another classic case of the bunny rabbit
having dinner in the mailbox."

61
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,380
What does that even mean?

62
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,360
"Once all three phrases have been said..."

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,740
"at the same immunity challenge..."

64
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,540
"then all three idols have power."

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,820
"But until then, you cannot vote
at any Tribal Council."

66
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,580
- Oh... my... gosh.
- Fudge!

67
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,820
Shiz!

68
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,240
That's so crazy.

69
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,200
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

70
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,480
<i>Not only do I not have an idol,</i>

71
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,260
<i>but I can't vote at
any Tribal Council</i>

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,380
<i>until other people find their
idol and say the secret phrase.</i>

73
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,120
<i>Yo, I got bait-and-switched.</i>

74
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,440
Wait.
You have no vote?

75
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,680
I don't have a vote.

76
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,620
Wow, what a spin.

77
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,220
Hey, have you seen my swimming shoes?

78
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,480
Goodness, where are they?

79
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,120
They were right here.

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,720
Where did they go?

81
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,880
Uh...

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,340
Maybe I brought them
to the watering hole.

83
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,740
He loses his stuff all the time.

84
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,440
Water bottles, shoes.

85
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,660
Shoulder.

86
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,660
Poor guy.

87
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,680
He's going through it out here.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,040
Good grief.

89
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,000
<i>Shoulder aside,
right now I feel good.</i>

90
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,680
<i>The group dynamics
of the tribe are basically</i>

91
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,060
<i>two pairs of two, where
you've got Jenny and Mike,</i>

92
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,000
<i>and on the other side
Hai and Lydia, and then</i>

93
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,900
<i>in between is Chanelle and I.</i>

94
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>And I know that
Mike has the idol,</i>

95
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,640
<i>but this one is a bit of a trick.</i>

96
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,740
<i>And so, like any
good lawyer would,</i>

97
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,600
<i>I need to look at
the fine print here.</i>

98
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,800
Dude, I need to read it.

99
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,860
- Bro, I'll try.
- Okay.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,980
All right, I'm not... I'm not...

101
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,180
After the last endeavor,
I'm not rushing to give it

102
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,100
take it out of my
pocket again, okay?

103
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,760
<i>I told Jenny and Daniel
about my idol,</i>

104
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,680
<i>but Daniel is a little neurotic.</i>

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,120
<i>So first he said to me:
"I need to read the note."</i>

106
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm not in a rush to have
anybody notice it...

107
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,100
or anything like that.

108
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,600
All right.

109
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,240
<i>The thing is, I didn't want
to get Daniel pissed,</i>

110
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,840
<i>and I wanted to
make him feel safe.</i>

111
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,820
<i>So against my better judgment,</i>

112
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,400
<i>I decided to let him read it.</i>

113
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,480
- Here, just...
- Read it, come back. Come back.

114
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,720
- Go read it.
- Okay, all right.

115
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,960
All right, thank you.
All right.

116
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,640
"If all three shared idols are
not found by the merge..."

117
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,280
"the vote penalty ends and
your idol has full power."

118
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,620
There's always something.

119
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,820
I missed that.

120
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,860
<i>Chanelle and I had been
planning to backstab Mike.</i>

121
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,960
<i>But embarrassingly, as a lawyer,
I missed the fine print.</i>

122
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,960
<i>The idols will not die
if we vote Mike out.</i>

123
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,780
<i>'Cause we would have
just voted out</i>

124
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,840
<i>the only idol that our tribe has.</i>

125
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,020
<i>This changes everything, and
it saved Mike's life, frankly.</i>

126
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,540
No, put it in my pocket.

127
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,740
All right. Done.

128
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:18,900
Good job.

129
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,240
<i>Daniel hands me
the whole package.</i>

130
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,560
<i>I open it up, and to my chagrin,</i>

131
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,860
<i>the idol and the
congratulation note is missing.</i>

132
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,960
- You never gave me the idol.
- Yes, I did.

133
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,260
- You only gave me the paper.
- No, I didn't.

134
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,400
I gave you everything.

135
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,360
<i>I seriously almost
stroked out right there.</i>

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,640
<i>"Get medical in here."
That's what I was thinking about.</i>

137
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,240
<i>"Get medical in here.
I'm stroking out."</i>

138
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,480
I gave you the whole thing.

139
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,980
I don't have it.

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,160
Let me look for...

141
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,180
<i>So, Mike's like:
"Dude, dude, you lost the idol."</i>

142
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,800
<i>And I'm like:
"Oh, my God, why?"</i>

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,460
<i>Why is this happening?</i>

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,780
This is exactly why
I didn't want to do it.

145
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,800
<i>I'm thinking: "No way, you
only gave me the piece of paper."</i>

146
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,080
<i>So I take him down to the
exact place where I read it.</i>

147
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
Uh, water bottle.

148
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,740
- Okay.
- Yeah.

149
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,680
It's a good sign.
Here.

150
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,200
Problem solved.

151
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,540
- Problem...
- Where's the rest of it, though?

152
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,300
Where's the rest of it?

153
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,780
- That's all you need.
- No, I need the "congratulations."

154
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,740
I need the other
person that finds it.

155
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,400
This is what I'm talking
about, dude. This is why...

156
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,380
Yeah, this is what
I'm talking about.

157
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,780
- This is why I didn't want to do it.
- Fine.

158
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,760
You're totally fine.

159
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,080
<i>To Mike's credit, he was totally right.</i>

160
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,360
<i>But I did drop the idol.</i>

161
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,660
<i>That's on me.</i>

162
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,080
<i>Again, another example of Daniel
Strunk having an epic fail.</i>

163
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,560
I almost lost the idol, and
it's my fault, and I'm sorry.

164
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,080
Come on in.

165
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,140
Oh, my God.

166
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,640
Ika, Vati, getting your first
look at the new Taku tribe.

167
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,340
Marya voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

168
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,300
Wow, Taku, you look
like you mean business.

169
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,960
Maryanne, you just
came in there with a scowl.

170
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,500
Yeah, like, you know,
going to Tribal sucks, and

171
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,520
it kind of reminds me of the
classic tale of the bunny rabbit

172
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,480
eating its dinner in the
mailbox, you know that one?

173
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,720
- I don't, tell me.
- Okay, so, like, you see,

174
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,080
like, your mailbox, and you open,

175
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,480
and there's, like, a bunny
rabbit and you're like:

176
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,400
"What's this bunny rabbit
doing here?", you know?

177
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,780
It's, like, you don't
know the whole story

178
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,800
unless you're the bunny.

179
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,860
All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,760
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

181
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,640
First things first, got to
take back the idols.

182
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,200
<i>I hear Maryanne recite her phrase.</i>

183
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:36,920
Thank you.

184
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,260
<i>I was waiting for the
other tribe to say something.</i>

185
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,100
<i>I heard nothing.</i>

186
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,420
<i>So I didn't say anything.</i>

187
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,060
Thank you.

188
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,080
<i>Because if I can go into the
merge with this secret of mine</i>

189
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,580
<i>and never have to say the line,</i>

190
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,240
<i>I have the idol and
nobody knows I have it.</i>

191
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,740
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

192
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,980
For today's challenge,

193
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,320
you're going to race out
and retrieve a ladder

194
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,500
off the bottom of the ocean floor.

195
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,360
You're going to use it
to reach a key.

196
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,900
You'll use the key to
unlock a set of sandbags

197
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,940
and attempt to land those sandbags

198
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,720
on a series of five targets.

199
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,680
First two tribes to finish win
immunity, safe from the vote.

200
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,580
In addition,
you're playing for reward.

201
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,960
Want to know
what you're playing for?

202
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,140
Let's see it, Jeff.

203
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,740
First tribe to finish...

204
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,580
Oh, baby.

205
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,640
- Survivor tool kit.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.

206
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,940
- And fruit.
- Oh, my gosh.

207
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,100
Pineapple!

208
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,640
Second tribe to finish...

209
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,540
smaller tool kit, smaller fruit.

210
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,920
- All right, guys.
- Oh, my gosh.

211
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,580
Last tribe to finish,
otherwise known as the losers:

212
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,800
Tribal Council, where
somebody will be voted out

213
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,660
of this game, and as a
penalty for losing,

214
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,460
I will take your flint.

215
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,220
Ika, you have one extra person.

216
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,220
Got to sit somebody out.
Who's it going to be?

217
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,540
All right.

218
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,780
Romeo, gonna sit this one out?

219
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,900
Vati, you have two extra people.

220
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,000
Gonna sit two players out.
Who's it gonna be?

221
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,240
Lydia and I.

222
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,900
Sit-outs, take a spot
on the benches.

223
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
Everybody else, give you
a minute to strategize.

224
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,440
Get it on.

225
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,940
Here we go.

226
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,500
For immunity.
Survivors ready?

227
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,840
Go!

228
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,240
Big swells out of the gate.

229
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,420
You are already fighting
water that wants

230
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,140
to move you in a direction
you may not want to go.

231
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,340
Tori, over here.

232
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,780
You've got to get
everybody to your ring.

233
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,700
- Come on... come on, Jenny.
- One person dives down.

234
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,160
Taku still waiting on Omar.

235
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,140
Jonathan out helping now.

236
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,380
Jonathan heading down.

237
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,660
Try and get to me!

238
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,800
Try and get to me, Jenn!

239
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,820
Vati still trying to get
everybody to their ring.

240
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,960
You got to dive down
and you've got to swim

241
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,100
against the current.

242
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,480
Jonathan has popped
the buoy for Taku.

243
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,520
They can now start working
on moving that ladder.

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,460
This challenge is much
more difficult today

245
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,420
simply due to the amount
of turbulence in the water.

246
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,380
Are you okay?

247
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,720
The water is moving
everybody off the course.

248
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm not mad about sitting out this one.

249
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,920
Come here, Omar!

250
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,440
Omar! Come here!

251
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,780
Jonathan is carrying
the ladder on his shoulder.

252
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,600
The ladder is no joke.

253
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,800
That ladder is heavy,
but you would not know it

254
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,180
watching Jonathan.

255
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,140
I'm getting it. Dont' worry.

256
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,620
- You got this, baby.
- You got it.

257
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,020
I'm really sorry, guys.

258
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,580
Don't be sorry.
You did fine.

259
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,940
Vati still struggling.

260
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,680
You got it! You got it!
You got it! You got it!

261
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,760
Jonathan now is going to
go retrieve tribe members.

262
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,780
First, he gets the ladder.

263
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,660
- Come with me.
- Now he's grabbing Omar...

264
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,320
- Come here, Maryanne.
- ...and reaching for Maryanne.

265
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,220
I got you, girl.

266
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,700
Jonathan is single-handedly

267
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,920
determined to win
this challenge for Taku.

268
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:37,860
Thank you.

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,480
As the two other tribes
are still working

270
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,720
- to get their ladder.
- One last one, you got it.

271
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,700
Ika has freed their ladder.

272
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,040
It is one of the most turbulent
days ever seen on Survivor.

273
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,920
Vati still working on their ladder.

274
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,460
In dead last.

275
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,180
Now you're going to
have to lift that ladder...

276
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,120
- ...and retrieve the key.
- Go up.

277
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,100
Go up.
Go ahead.

278
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,460
Jonathan is holding the
ladder and Lindsay by himself.

279
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,140
All right.
Keep it, keep it.

280
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,520
It is an amazing
performance to watch.

281
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,140
One more!
Got it! Got it!

282
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,320
Yeah, she's got it.
Lindsay back in the water.

283
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,220
Taku extending their lead.

284
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,560
Here comes Ika.

285
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,700
The ocean is dragging them away

286
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,140
from where they want to be,

287
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,160
and they've got to fight
against the water to get back.

288
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,040
Taku exhausted,
but they are in the lead.

289
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,380
Now you're going
to use that ladder...

290
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,420
- ...to get the set of sandbags.
- Good enough.

291
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,960
Vati has popped their buoy.

292
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,140
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

293
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,800
The ocean is continuing
to pull players away.

294
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,280
We rarely see anything like this.

295
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,540
Taku now working on the
rest of their sandbags.

296
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,680
And they've got 'em.

297
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,280
- Ika, keep fighting!
- The key, I got it.

298
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,280
Here comes Vati,
continuing to fight the ocean,

299
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,500
trying to get back.

300
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,520
My god, you're so close!

301
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,320
Jonathan lands the first sandbag.

302
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,280
Yes.

303
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,640
Jonathan lands the second sandbag.

304
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,800
- Guys, you gotta pick the ladder up.
- Vati now very close to their key.

305
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,640
They're gonna have to
coordinate getting that ladder up.

306
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,640
This has been Jonathan
challenge's from the go.

307
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,900
The question is, will either of the
other two tribes even finish?

308
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,340
I got it.

309
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,320
Jonathan does it!
Taku wins immunity and reward!

310
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,200
No Tribal Council tonight.

311
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,820
Now the focus comes down
to the two remaining tribes:

312
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,560
Vati and Ika.

313
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,000
- Go where it's shallow!
- I'm trying to!

314
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,800
Mike and Hai holding the
ladder, trying to get it stable,

315
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,340
but that ocean is going
to have something to say.

316
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,180
And another wave comes,
pushing Vati away again.

317
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,440
Oh, my God.

318
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,180
I don't know if either of the teams
are gonna be able to do it.

319
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,280
Another big wave.

320
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,300
And there are more coming.
These swells continue.

321
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,260
On day seven of Survivor 42.

322
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,720
- Here comes another one.
- Big wave, big wave.

323
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,320
And another.

324
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,200
- I need help!
- There is no relief.

325
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,200
I got it!

326
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,660
It's getting more difficult
with every minute that passes.

327
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,600
All I care about are
the sandbags.

328
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,620
Guys?

329
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,480
Hey, both tribes!

330
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,200
Drag your ladders in.

331
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,740
Come in.

332
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,860
- Let's go.
- Get back in.

333
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,180
- Drag it right up here...
- What?

334
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,720
and place it here and wait.

335
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,320
Perfect.
Right there is good.

336
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,100
Drop it.

337
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,980
- Oh, my gosh.
- They must be so beat.

338
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,960
Yeah.

339
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,920
Yeah.

340
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,300
All right, here's what
we're gonna do.

341
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,120
Due to no lack
of effort on your part,

342
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,400
this is not getting any easier.

343
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,700
We're going to retrieve
your keys and give them to you,

344
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,660
and we'll continue
the challenge from here.

345
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,760
- Sound fair?
- Yeah.

346
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,580
Never done this in
the history of Survivor.

347
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,820
Let's get the keys.

348
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,780
You're almost there!

349
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,740
Catch your breath
and get a strategy.

350
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,740
- You guys are killing it!
- This challenge is still alive.

351
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,920
Get ready!
Get ready!

352
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,640
Gas ourselves right here.
We can do this, Ika.

353
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,380
Who wants it?

354
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,720
- Wait for me, wait for me.
- All right, guys, come on.

355
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,620
All right, we're going
to resume the challenge.

356
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,560
Survivors ready?

357
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,460
Go!

358
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,780
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Come on, guys.

359
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,440
Now, with what
energy you have left,

360
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,520
you got to finish this sucker.

361
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,380
Lift it up a little bit.
Lift.

362
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,460
You got to get the ladder up.
This one's a lot easier

363
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,160
'cause you've got a
sure way to the top.

364
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,040
Vati's up first.

365
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,080
- Jenny gonna go.
- Come on, Jenny.

366
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,660
Now Ika has it.
Swati going up.

367
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,580
Jenny has the sandbags,
she's down.

368
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,000
- Toss it down.
- Swati has the sandbags.

369
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,100
She's coming down.

370
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,140
It's going to be Hai
tossing for Vati.

371
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,080
Hai lands the first one for Vati.

372
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,000
Rocksroy lands the first for Ika.

373
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,900
We are tied 1-1.
Five bags total.

374
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,500
Rocksroy off and on.

375
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,820
Chanelle lands the
second for Vati.

376
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,120
Rocksroy lands the
second for Ika, we're tied.

377
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,580
Rocksroy lands the third.

378
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,240
Ika now in the lead.

379
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,940
Yes, Mike!

380
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,820
Mike sticks the
third bag for Vati.

381
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,040
And we are tied 3-3.

382
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,040
Mike would love to
put Vati in the lead.

383
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,000
- And he does with that toss.
- Yes! Come on!

384
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,860
There's Rocksroy to tie it.

385
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,000
Rocksroy lands the fourth bag,
and we are tied again.

386
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,180
It's a showdown.
One bag left.

387
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,500
Mike can win it.
No.

388
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,320
Rocksroy can win it right here.

389
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,540
On and off.

390
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,420
Chanelle's gonna come back in.

391
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,960
Can she win it
with the jumper?

392
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
- No.
- No!

393
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,540
Now it's Drea who
could win it for Ika.

394
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,760
It's okay, you got it.

395
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,000
You want me
to take it, I'll take it.

396
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,160
One tribe looking
to close it out.

397
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,520
And Drea does it for Ika!

398
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,600
Sending Vati to Tribal Council
for the first time this season!

399
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,420
What a battle.
Wow.

400
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,080
Taku, congratulations,
immunity is yours.

401
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,600
Nobody going home
from your tribe.

402
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,860
Plus you win reward.

403
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,900
Because you didn't
win the fishing gear,

404
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,020
you have the option to swap
that fruit for the fishing gear.

405
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,160
You're already shaking your head.

406
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,160
- You want the fishing gear?
- Yeah, Jeff.

407
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,480
We would like the
fishing gear, Jeff.

408
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,880
All right, fishing gear will
be waiting for you back at camp.

409
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,180
Thank you, Jeff.

410
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,980
And I got to say, Jonathan,
I've seen a lot of challenges.

411
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,840
I've rarely seen an individual
performance like that.

412
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,580
- Nice job.
- Wow.

413
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,280
Ika, doesn't matter
you finished second.

414
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:25,960
I'll take it.

415
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,020
Only matters you're
not going to Tribal.

416
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,420
Your reward will be waiting
for you back at camp.

417
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,240
Small tool kit,
little bit of fruit.

418
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,100
All right, before
I send you guys off,

419
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,520
Taku, you're going
to pick one person

420
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,740
from Vati's tribe
to go on a journey.

421
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,020
You guys can talk about it.

422
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,520
It can't be somebody
who's gone on a journey.

423
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,060
All right, who you going to send?

424
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,520
We're going to send Chanelle.

425
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,760
Chanelle's going to
go on the journey.

426
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,580
The question is:
who will go with Chanelle?

427
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,020
You're going to
pick one more person,

428
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,240
and it can be from
your tribe or from Ika.

429
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,300
What'd you decide?

430
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,180
- We're gonna send me.
- All right.

431
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,700
Omar and Chanelle, you guys
are gonna take a journey.

432
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,860
You will return back to
your camps end of day.

433
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,100
Grab your stuff, head out.

434
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,240
- Thank you.
- Boat'll pick you up.

435
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,620
- Bye, Omar.
- Bye.

436
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,840
All right, Taku, Ika,
grab your stuff, head back to camp.

437
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,460
No Tribal Council, and your
flint will be waiting for you...

438
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,200
-... back at camp, as well.
- Thanks, Jeff.

439
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,020
All right, Vati,
Tribal Council tonight,

440
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,420
where somebody will be
voted out.

441
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,860
Before you go,
I'll take your flint.

442
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,440
You'll have a chance
to earn this back

443
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,480
at your next immunity challenge.

444
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,200
Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight at Tribal.

445
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,220
Thank you.

446
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,040
<i>I'm excited to make a
connection across tribal lines.</i>

447
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,340
<i>But that's a very scary thing,</i>

448
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,120
<i>to know that my
tribe is back at camp,</i>

449
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,240
<i>scurrying around, scrambling,
trying to decide a vote,</i>

450
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,860
<i>and I'm not a part of it.</i>

451
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,780
<i>Today's challenge was brutal.</i>

452
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,940
<i>We ended up losing, and
Chanelle being away right now</i>

453
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,260
<i>definitely scares me a bit.</i>

454
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,040
<i>I know there is a decision
to make on the journey.</i>

455
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,120
Well, that sucked.

456
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,620
- Yeah.
- That was just brutal.

457
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,980
I'm proud of you for
going as long as we did.

458
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,320
<i>Mike doesn't have a vote, so,</i>

459
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,900
<i>I hope that Chanelle
played it safe.</i>

460
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,960
<i>I can't stress that enough.</i>

461
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,880
<i>I need her to vote with us.</i>

462
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,580
Anyone want to wash off with me?
I'm gonna go wash off.

463
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,840
Yeah, I'm gonna
wash off with you.

464
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,420
Okay.

465
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,800
- Leave this stuff...
- What's this journey?

466
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,800
- ....and then get pretty for Tribal--
- What is this journey Chanelle is on?

467
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,120
Yeah, welll it's probably the same
sort of thing that Jenny went on.

468
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,980
- Yeah.
- So, we'll hear about it.

469
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,920
Whoever wants to
come is welcome.

470
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,620
- So, we love Lydia.
- Yup.

471
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,060
- You, me, Dan.
- I can't vote.

472
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,920
- I don't have a vote.
- Oh, right, right.

473
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,980
Okay, that's... so, me, Daniel,
Chanelle will vote Lydia.

474
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,680
Okay, yeah.

475
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,540
Good, good. I know Chanelle's solid.

476
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,240
Daniel's the only one who
gets me a little nervous.

477
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

478
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,920
<i>We pretty much
have a game plan.</i>

479
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,280
<i>We're going to vote Lydia out,
but I have no vote, </i>

480
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,000
<i>and Daniel can get
a little squirrelly.</i>

481
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,340
<i>So obviously I'm a
little nervous that</i>

482
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,600
<i>he would bail on us.</i>

483
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,880
<i>He would go to
somebody he thinks</i>

484
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,620
<i>is strong 'cause he thinks
that's what it's all about.</i>

485
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,760
We got to make it fast 'cause
the three of us can't be seen.

486
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,310
The three of us can't 
be seen talking long.

487
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,480
- I know, yeah.
- So, have you heard either...

488
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,700
- ...of our names from them?
- No.

489
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,860
- Okay.
- Okay.

490
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,760
- We're just all voting for Jenny?
- Yeah.

491
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,980
Okay.

492
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,500
<i>Right now, I feel very comfortable</i>

493
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,160
<i>with Lydia, Chanelle and Daniel,</i>

494
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,360
<i>but tonight will be the
ultimate test of trust for us.</i>

495
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,900
<i>This first Tribal will
establish who's with who,</i>

496
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,280
<i>and I just got to make sure I'm
on the right side of the numbers.</i>

497
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,800
Hai's still down there?

498
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,340
That was rough, right,
from the outside?

499
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,620
Real quick.
They think...

500
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,800
I'm with them,
but I'm with you guys.

501
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,320
- I wanted to keep up appearances.
- Who are they trying to target?

502
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,220
Jenny.
To be totally blunt.

503
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,320
I'll always be honest.
They're targeting Jenny.

504
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,560
But it doesn't matter
because we got me, you,

505
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,100
and Chanelle's vote are three.

506
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,320
That's a majority of the five,
so we'll put our votes on Lydia.

507
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,580
Listen. Listen to me.
You're not going home.

508
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,780
This is gonna work out tonight.

509
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,000
I hope so.
I'm a bit nervous.

510
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,440
<i>I would prefer Lydia to go home
because Lydia is someone</i>

511
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,520
<i>who I'm less close
with than Jenny.</i>

512
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,060
<i>But Jenny and Mike only
have one vote combined.</i>

513
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,100
<i>Hai and Lydia have two votes.</i>

514
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,280
<i>So Chanelle very much is...</i>

515
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,660
<i>the deciding vote right now.</i>

516
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,800
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

517
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,600
That was torture.

518
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,540
- But she was...
- Jenny totally undersold this.

519
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,460
Yeah, but I guess they were
less deprived at that point.

520
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,320
Yes, they were, yeah.

521
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,000
Maryanne said there was a decision

522
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,140
about whether to get the vote
or to lose a vote, basically.

523
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,280
Yup, that was what
Jenny told us.

524
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,380
And I definitely can't lose a
vote going into Tribal tonight.

525
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,600
- Yeah.
- Especially feeling...

526
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,140
- ...uncertain about where I am.
- Yeah.

527
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,240
And my goal is
to build trust with you.

528
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,520
So I don't want to make a 
decision that screws you over.

529
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,840
Yeah, let's try best not
to screw over the other person.

530
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,900
If we can both walk out of
this with an advantage.

531
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,900
- I'm happy.
- Yeah, right, right, right, right.

532
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,500
<i>I get good vibes from Chanelle.</i>

533
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,500
<i>Like, it's crazy how much
communication out here is nonverbal.</i>

534
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,030
<i>Like, it's unspoken.</i>

535
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,160
<i>You can just tell who
you may trust or vibe with.</i>

536
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,960
"You will now separate
and make a private decision

537
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
before returning to camp."

538
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,340
<i>I trust Chanelle.</i>

539
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,200
<i>She just seemed very genuine
and honest but smart.</i>

540
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,240
<i>And I don't think she's
more sneaky than me,</i>

541
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,120
<i>which is what I want.</i>

542
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,360
If we can both get something
without screwing over

543
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,000
the other person
and losing their vote...

544
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,280
- ...we should do it, right?
- Yup.

545
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,140
<i>Omar and I like each other,
and we want to work together,</i>

546
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,280
<i>and we decided if we can
both protect each other</i>

547
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,280
<i>and get something,
great, let's do it.</i>

548
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,900
<i>If not, let's just play it safe.</i>

549
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,260
"After spending the day together..."

550
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,500
"you must now make a strategic decision..."

551
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,080
"based on how well you
got to know each other."

552
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,800
"Protect your vote...

553
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,660
or risk your vote."

554
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,820
"If both players choose to protect your vote..."

555
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,800
"nothing changes, but..."

556
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,700
"If both players choose to risk their vote..."

557
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,300
"then both players lose their vote..."

558
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,240
"...at the next Tribal Council."

559
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,520
Oh, my goodness.

560
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,680
"If it is a split decision..."

561
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,840
"the player who chooses to..."

562
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,240
"protect your vote..."

563
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,140
"remains the same."

564
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,620
"The player who chose to..."

565
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,040
"risk their vote..."

566
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,260
"receives an extra vote."

567
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,660
Wow.

568
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,120
"You will learn the results in
the voting booth at Tribal Council."

569
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,860
<i>The hard part of this
decision of playing it safe</i>

570
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,360
<i>versus risking your vote is that</i>

571
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,180
<i>I don't know what
Chanelle's gonna do.</i>

572
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,200
<i>I could either play it
safe or take a risk</i>

573
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,560
<i>and wager my vote
to have an extra vote.</i>

574
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,080
<i>Initially, my thought is,
just play it safe,</i>

575
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,220
<i>but as I thought it
through, in this game,</i>

576
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,620
<i>it's all about motivation.</i>

577
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,520
<i>You have to know
other players' motivation</i>

578
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,120
<i>and what's best for their game.</i>

579
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,420
I don't think Chanelle's
going to risk her vote.

580
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,800
<i>From my read on Omar,
I think that he might</i>

581
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,800
<i>play it safe, and I think
that he wants to protect me</i>

582
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,260
<i>and leave me in a good place
before Tribal Council.</i>

583
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,220
<i>Chanelle made it
very clear to me</i>

584
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,320
<i>that she could not
lose her vote tonight.</i>

585
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,720
<i>And if she's playing it safe,
that means I can get away</i>

586
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,220
<i>with risking my vote.</i>
Which means</i>

587
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,000
I could get an extra vote,
which could change the game.

588
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,940
So...

589
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,340
I think that I'm going to...

590
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,520
go for the gusto
and risk the vote.

591
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,320
<i>It's a massive risk considering</i>

592
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,020
<i>that I'm facing
Tribal Council tonight.</i>

593
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,160
<i>In that voting booth,
I do not want to see</i>

594
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,500
<i>something that says "no vote."</i>

595
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,760
<i>That would be devastating.</i>

596
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,180
<i>But I'm not playing
a scared game.</i>

597
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,000
<i>I'm playing a game
for a million dollars.</i>

598
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,480
<i>I got to make big moves
to get a big reward.</i>

599
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,040
<i>Daniel is NASA.
He's a smart guy.</i>

600
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,760
<i>You know, he went to Yale,
he went to Duke.</i>

601
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,600
<i>Like, he can persuade,
you know, alliances.</i>

602
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,860
- Daniel, did you talk to them?
- Yeah.

603
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,120
They made a pitch
to me to join them,

604
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
but no need
to worry about anything.

605
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,960
Okay, as long as us
four stick together.

606
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,440
Yeah.

607
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,700
<i>But at this point,</i>

608
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,280
<i>I know that my name's
getting thrown out.</i>

609
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,780
<i>It's really scary not having
one of our numbers</i>

610
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,680
<i>here to even just, like, talk to.</i>

611
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,800
Damn, I can't believe
Chanelle's not here.

612
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,760
<i>Me, Hai, Chanelle and Daniel </i>

613
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,580
<i>putting just four
votes on Jenny,</i>

614
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,060
<i>just hoping to God
she doesn't have an idol.</i>

615
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,400
<i>And it potentially would be Mike</i>

616
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,180
<i>and Jenny putting
votes on me.</i>

617
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,080
- I wish we could talk to Chanelle.
- Yeah.

618
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,280
<i>I took a gamble,
and I risked my vote.</i>

619
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,200
<i>And so, might not even
have a vote tonight.</i>

620
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,820
<i>My first thought is,
Mike can't vote, and</i>

621
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,700
<i>that means that our numbers
could be completely messed up.</i>

622
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,680
Jeez, this is good timing.

623
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,940
I didn't even see you come in.

624
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,440
This is good...
What? You okay?

625
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,940
Yeah, what'd I miss?

626
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,480
It's either Lydia or...

627
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,640
Jenny.

628
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,900
It comes down to us.

629
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,080
We gotta take out Lydia.

630
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,860
We have to convincie them to split the vote.

631
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,540
To split the vote?

632
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,200
I think I don't have a vote.

633
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,280
Oh, God.

634
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,500
<i>Chanelle might not have a vote.</i>

635
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,300
<i>So the plan going in was for Hai
and Lydia to split votes</i>

636
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,180
<i>where Hai would
put a vote on Mike,</i>

637
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,940
<i>Lydia would put a vote on Jenny.</i>

638
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,080
<i>And then I would vote for Lydia</i>

639
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,760
<i>so that my Lydia vote combined
with Jenny's Lydia vote</i>

640
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,920
<i>would be the majority.</i>

641
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,140
<i>So it'd be a two-one-one vote.</i>

642
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,080
Lydia.

643
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,940
Yeah, solid.

644
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,000
<i>The problem is, this play
at Tribal really only works</i>

645
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,840
<i>if Hai and Lydia are both
genuinely tricked into splitting.</i>

646
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,820
What's going on? What'd I miss?

647
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,740
A lot happened.

648
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,760
Oh, my gosh.

649
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,960
Jenny and Mike...

650
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,840
- Their two votes are going to Lydia.
- Okay.

651
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,160
So, we need to do
three Jenny, one Mike.

652
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,400
- Three Jenny, one Mike?
- Yes, just in case...

653
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,740
Just in case there's
some sort of idol.

654
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,120
What's the...
What's the math there?

655
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,800
I mean, the math
doesn't make sense.

656
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,580
We need to do:
girls on Jenny, boys on Mike,

657
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,640
and then we get
Jenny out of here.

658
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,320
<i>Chanelle is usually very calm,
cool and collected.</i>

659
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,460
<i>However, when she came
back from her journey,</i>

660
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,200
<i>she seemed a bit frazzled.</i>

661
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,780
<i>All of a sudden, she wants
to vote: girls Jenny and boys Mike.</i>

662
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,890
Girls on Jenny, boys on Mike.

663
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,360
- Girls on...
- We're splitting it, though?

664
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah, we have to because we
don't know if they have an idol.

665
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,600
<i>This doesn't add up to me,</i>

666
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,680
<i>and I could be overspeculating,
but I trust my gut.</i>

667
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,220
I gotta tell you, I'm hurting from that today.

668
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,760
You don't have to question me, I'm good.

669
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,740
Oh, I'm not questioning you.

670
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,900
- You don't...
- I know where we are.

671
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,500
<i>I've set up a great foundation</i>

672
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,620
<i>in the days leading up
to this Tribal.</i>

673
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,540
<i>So I think going into Tribal
Council tonight is my call,</i>

674
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,080
<i>and I might not even have a vote.</i>

675
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,060
<i>That is the power
of my social game.</i>

676
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,180
<i>I can direct the votes
without even having one.</i>

677
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,360
Behind each of you is a torch.

678
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,680
Go ahead and grab a torch.

679
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,720
Approach a flame,
dip it in and get fire.

680
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
This is part of the ritual
of Tribal Council

681
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,760
because in this game
fire represents your life,

682
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,120
and when your fire is gone,
so are you.

683
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,300
Sadly, that will be the case
for one of you tonight.

684
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,080
So let's talk about the
first days out here.

685
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,700
Hai, what's it been like
living in a jungle?

686
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,760
I dreamed of this
since I was a child,

687
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,720
and coming out here was surreal.

688
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,260
However, when you said
that we were starting the game

689
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,920
with no rice, I thought
you were out of your mind.

690
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,840
All six of us are
struggling physically,

691
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,280
emotionally, mentally, but
I'm still happy to be here.

692
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,520
Chanelle, let's talk
about your journey.

693
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,380
- Yeah.
- When you come back to camp,

694
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,280
what is being talked about
with these journeys?

695
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,720
You know, I explained
to my tribe

696
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,200
that I had a decision to make.

697
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,860
It was either to play it safe
or to take a risk.

698
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,240
I chose to play it safe,

699
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,440
and, hopefully,
it works out in my favor.

700
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,740
And, Mike, when you hear
that story, playing it safe.

701
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,820
Do you evaluate:
"Do I believe her or not?"

702
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,840
You know, I'm a guy
that takes things at face value.

703
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,580
If somebody tells me something,
I want to... I believe it.

704
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,240
We've been together
for the starving, the building,

705
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,840
the running through challenges.

706
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,580
We've made a bond
amongst all of us,

707
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,420
and I don't think
she would come back

708
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,780
and give us a snow job.

709
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,240
Hai, do you think that
you can vote somebody out

710
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,120
and still go back to camp
and have the kumbaya

711
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,500
that you guys are talking about?

712
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,320
While tonight will draw tribal lines,

713
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,940
I believe the Vati six is
strong enough to go back,

714
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,360
regroup and collect
ourselves because

715
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,560
these guys are my family,
and I trust them.

716
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,220
Daniel, do you agree, tonight
will draw lines no matter what?

717
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,440
100% it's gonna draw lines.

718
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,700
That's true, but, Jeff, let me
tell you why I will lose season 42.

719
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,880
The reason is because I'm
constantly in a state of paranoia.

720
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,580
I'm running numbers, going nuts.
It's driving me crazy.

721
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,000
And you can't win that way

722
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,360
because you've got
to trust your gut.

723
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,060
But if you're always paranoid,
you can't trust your gut

724
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,300
because you can't differentiate

725
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,220
between the paranoia
and your gut.

726
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,940
So for me, I need some people
that are just going to tell me

727
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,280
to chill every once in a while.

728
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,520
Who calms you down?

729
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,220
Mike calms me down.
Chanelle calms me down.

730
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,680
My mother calms me down.
My girlfriend.

731
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,220
You calm me down, Jeff.

732
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,820
Not really.
You don't calm me down.

733
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,940
This is scary
being here right now.

734
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,860
So, Lydia, will it be difficult
for you to make a vote,

735
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,920
or is there a part of you that
"this is why I came to play"?

736
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,720
I mean, I'm...
Personally, I'm terrified.

737
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,560
I am excited because,
you know, as a fan you're like:

738
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,700
"This is really neat."

739
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,600
Like, you could just...
This is gnarly.

740
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,880
Like, this is wild.

741
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,360
You know, so there is that excitement.

742
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,920
But then there's that horrible reality,

743
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,260
like what if it is me?

744
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,820
Jenny, Lydia just said it.

745
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,100
You can say it's hard
and you can say it's exciting.

746
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,540
But the thing that's lingering
in everybody's head is:

747
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,060
"Unless it's me."

748
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,400
My heart is pounding
through my chest right now

749
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,040
because it could be me.

750
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,640
I did go on that summit,
and I told a story

751
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,120
when I came back
about what occurred there,

752
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,120
and I told the truth.

753
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,700
But there is this little
doubt in my mind

754
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,820
that thinks people
might not believe me.

755
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,400
All right, it is time to vote.
Jenny, you're up.

756
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,120
If anybody has an
advantage or an idol

757
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,400
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

758
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,000
All right, I'll read the votes.

759
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,300
First vote...

760
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,980
Lydia.

761
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,320
Jenny.

762
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,200
Lydia.
Two votes Lydia, one vote Jenny.

763
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,760
Jenny.
We're tied.

764
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,180
Two votes Jenny,
two votes Lydia.

765
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,260
No votes left.

766
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,660
We're going to revote.

767
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,860
You can only vote now
for Jenny or Lydia.

768
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,520
Lydia and Jenny,
you won't vote.

769
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,020
Hai, you're going
to be up first.

770
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,500
Will you come grab this,
take it back?

771
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,640
I'll read the votes.

772
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,080
First vote...

773
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,220
Jenny.

774
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,620
Lydia.

775
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,180
We are tied.

776
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,960
Now, here's what's going
to happen.

777
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,300
Clearly, you are deadlocked.

778
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,920
What's wrong, Hai?

779
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,540
Where are the votes?

780
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,340
Let me get to it.

781
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,180
Per the rules of Survivor,
the four of you:

782
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,100
Hai, Daniel, Mike and Chanelle
will have a discussion.

783
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,780
You have to come
to a unanimous decision

784
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,720
about who you want to send
home: either Jenny or Lydia.

785
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,180
If you can't come
to a unanimous decision,

786
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,240
Jenny and Lydia become safe,

787
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,060
and the four of you
will draw rocks,

788
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,460
and the odd rock out goes home.

789
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,180
Before we get to that, though,
we have another Survivor first.

790
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,280
There were only two votes cast,

791
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,060
which means two
people did not vote.

792
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,840
Didn't anticipate having
to reveal who you are,

793
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,440
but now because of a tie
and the inability

794
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,080
to vote somebody out,
you have to.

795
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,700
So, who didn't vote?

796
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,980
So, Mike and Chanelle,

797
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,780
you can try to
influence Hai and Daniel,

798
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,000
but you have no say
in the decision.

799
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,640
It will come down
to Hai and Daniel.

800
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,080
You guys will decide.

801
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,880
All right, Hai and Daniel,
the decision comes down to you.

802
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,440
You have to come
to a unanimous decision

803
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,400
about who you want to send 
home: either Jenny or Lydia.

804
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,820
If you can't, they're safe,

805
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,040
and one of the four
of you will go home.

806
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,920
- Can I ask a question?
- Yeah.

807
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,080
If we were to draw
rocks, even though

808
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,900
we were the only two votes,
are the rocks four rocks?

809
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,660
- Okay.
- Four rocks.

810
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,620
- And can we begin the discussion?
- Yes.

811
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,480
Okay.

812
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,480
I want to get the ball rolling

813
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,960
by starting with the
following premise.

814
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,580
I really do not want
to draw rocks.

815
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,840
Let's hammer it out
and get to a consensus

816
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,600
so that on the very
first vote in day seven,

817
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,780
we don't put our
fate in a bag of rocks.

818
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,500
I really, really don't want
that to happen.

819
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,980
Why did I lose
your trust tonight?

820
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,920
You didn't lose
my trust tonight.

821
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,600
I've always trusted you.

822
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,660
I was under the impression
Chanelle wanted me to vote Lydia.

823
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,560
Now, Chanelle, if you
wanted me to vote Jenny,

824
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
please let me know.

825
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,460
This isn't my...
I don't have a vote.

826
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,740
- I know, I know, I know, I know.
- This isn't on me.

827
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,100
But I was voting on your
behalf in a way tonight.

828
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,140
So if it is that...
Wait, wait, Chanelle.

829
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,560
- Chanelle told you Lydia?
- Yes.

830
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,140
- When?
- Um, before we left.

831
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,180
Wait, we all had
a discussion, though.

832
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,020
- Before we left at camp.
- Daniel, I'm super confused,

833
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,360
'cause we all had a discussion
on how we were voting,

834
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,160
and we knew what it was.

835
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,360
The four of us were at the
well, and you were there.

836
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,760
So, wait, wait, Chanelle,
I want to know who you want out.

837
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,860
- I don't have a vote.
- I know, I know, I'm asking you right now.

838
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,360
If you did have a vote,
who would you want out?

839
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,100
Because if you tell me Jenny,
I'm willing to agree with Hai

840
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,260
and send Jenny home.

841
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,440
Right now this is inconsequential.

842
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,820
Right now is, do the four of us
want to go to rocks?

843
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,220
If we can agree what makes
our tribe better, will you both

844
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,800
vote together so we
don't have to draw rocks?

845
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

846
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,620
No matter what
the feelings are.

847
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,200
The feelings are
irrelevant right now.

848
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,780
Yeah.

849
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,080
What we need to do is
get past this point.

850
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,520
We can iron that back at camp.

851
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,640
Jenny, I'm going to own
up to my vote, I voted for you.

852
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,400
You and Mike are all
about strength, and I knew that.

853
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,600
I had to protect my ally Lydia.

854
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,460
And I love you,
and I apologize, but...

855
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,080
I'm not changing my vote.

856
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,020
And I have been fully
honest with you, Daniel.

857
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,820
I said from day one
that I want to work with you.

858
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,320
- Yeah.
- I've never lied to you.

859
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,100
So why don't I give
my rationale here?

860
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,100
I wanted to work with Chanelle,
so we talked.

861
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,040
- Wait, wait, wait.
- No, no, no, no, no.

862
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,640
- Daniel, Daniel.
- No!

863
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,180
- No, no.
- Yes!

864
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,880
- That's not okay, that's not okay.
- That's 100% true.

865
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,200
- That is 100% true.
- Don't tell me that you,

866
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,740
a superfan of Survivor,
came on here and said:

867
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,380
"Oh, I'm just going
to let Chanelle choose."

868
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,320
-That's not true at all.
-No.

869
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,300
- That is 100% true.
- That is not true at all.

870
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,940
Hai, you have to believe
me when I tell you...

871
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,920
- Hai, that's not true.
-...the only reason I voted Lydia...

872
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,700
- Okay.
-...was because Chanelle told me...

873
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,860
- that we were in...
- Hai, please believe this...

874
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,940
- ...a four-person alliance here.
- Okay, I understand,

875
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,800
but I'm asking Chanelle, please

876
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,200
tell Daniel who you
would like to vote out.

877
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,260
- I want to know...
- Daniel, I--

878
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,280
Wait, before she
answers that question,

879
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,420
I need to ask Hai
a question, I'm sorry.

880
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,660
Is there any way you're going
to change your vote?

881
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,300
Is...? Do you want
to draw rocks?

882
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,020
- Hai, I want to talk with you.
- We need you both to...

883
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,000
- I did, too.
- Hai.

884
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,160
We can do this, Hai.

885
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,440
But I want to let you
know that I trust you.

886
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,240
We have to come
to a decision.

887
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,860
And I've been with
you since day one.

888
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,900
I've been wanting to work
with you since day one.

889
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,960
Hai, if you vote me out,
you're fracturing the tribe.

890
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,680
We all had agreed
to vote Lydia.

891
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,700
Yeah, I--

892
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,380
I want to stay strong as a tribe.

893
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,820
- That's true.
- I understand the confusion right now.

894
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,440
I love y'all.
I'm willing to draw rocks.

895
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,800
I'm not changing
my vote from Jenny.

896
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,020
I'm sorry.
I have to keep my numbers.

897
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,080
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

898
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,900
- I'm so sorry.
- Hai.

899
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,200
I really mean that.

900
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,040
And, Daniel, I'm asking you now,

901
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,720
- are you my ally?
- Yes, I am your ally 100%.

902
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,160
Because I just got
backstabbed by the person

903
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,200
- I thought was actually my...
- Wow.

904
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,800
Then will you please
be with me tonight?

905
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,980
- Will you hold this against me?
- No.

906
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,260
Do you believe me
when I tell you

907
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,900
I was doing what I thought was
in a group of four?

908
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,020
- We can hash it out at camp.
- I can't believe Daniel.

909
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,880
Okay.

910
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,320
- I'm still with you.
- Snake.

911
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,300
I need you to prove
yourself to me

912
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,800
because I've proven
myself to you.

913
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,460
Lydia, would you hold
this against me?

914
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,620
- No.
- Okay.

915
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,460
You promise?

916
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,420
- Guys.
- I promise.

917
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,140
We've had really honest
discussions, I trust you.

918
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,240
All right, so, have
you made an official

919
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,680
decision of who you're
going to send home?

920
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,280
I'm sticking with my vote, Jeff.

921
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,540
I vote Jenny.

922
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,160
Daniel?

923
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,480
I just cannot go
to rocks on day seven.

924
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,460
With absolutely no joy...

925
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,160
I've decided on Jenny.

926
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,560
All right, Jenny,
you are the fourth person

927
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,620
voted out of the game.

928
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,000
- You need to grab your torch.
- I'm sorry, Jenny.

929
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,020
I'm so sorry, too.

930
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,400
Thank you.

931
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,860
Jenny, the tribe has spoken.

932
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,740
Time for you to go.

933
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,020
It's never easy.

934
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,500
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

935
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,880
Good night.

936
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,720
<i>Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.</i>

937
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,080
<i>Next time on Survivor...</i>

938
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,920
I'm just angry at Jonathan.

939
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,700
Jonathan opens his big mouth.

940
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,280
My main man is a bit of a slob.

941
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,200
Add more.

942
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,040
"Make a knot here.
Pick that one up."

943
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,460
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow.

944
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,220
Rocksroy, shut the hell up.

945
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,820
You weren't my number one so I lied...

946
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,420
- You played, that's called playing me.
- I know.

947
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,220
There ain't no kumbaya.
It's like holy crap-baya.

948
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,320
<i>I thought we had it, but
Chanelle did not have a vote</i>

949
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,240
<i>to cast today, and I'm really
disappointed in Daniel.</i>

950
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,740
<i>He turned around and seems</i>

951
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,140
<i>to have embraced his relationship
with Hai more than mine.</i>

952
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,920
<i>You guys better
look out for Hai</i>

953
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,520
<i>because I think
he's going to be</i>

954
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,980
<i>slitting all of your
throats in the end.</i>
