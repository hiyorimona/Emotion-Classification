1
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:07,551
That was wild.

2
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:09,275
You can breathe.
- Oh, my God.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,655
I am so happy I'm here with all of you. Yeah.

4
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:14,896
I need to give everybody a hug.

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:15,586
Oh.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,724
Nobody wanted to see you go.

7
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:19,620
Oh, my God, I'm so, so happy.

8
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:21,586
Wow. How wild was that?
Hey, Lindsay...

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,793
That was the best Tribal Council
ever. Ever, ever, ever.

10
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:29,655
<i>I couldn't believe that
I actually picked the right box.</i>

11
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,655
That was awesome.

12
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:33,517
<i>And then Drea pulls out</i>

13
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:35,551
her advantage, which says

14
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:37,551
that she can ask anybody
one question--

15
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:39,793
if they have an advantage,
or they have an idol.

16
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:41,862
<i>And they have to be honest</i> <i>
if they do,</i>

17
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:43,137
<i>and if they do,</i> <i>
they have to give it to her.</i>

18
00:00:43,172 --> 00:00:45,000
Mike, do you have an idol?

19
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:46,862
No.

20
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:50,413
I can verify
Mike is telling the truth.

21
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:52,172
Oh, my gosh!

22
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:57,172
Omar, you're the only person
I told the secret to, and I want

23
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:58,586
everyone else to know that.

24
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,448
It was a such a great play.

25
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,931
So, she didn't get to use it.

26
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:09,275
<i>The vote went to Drea.</i> <i>
She's out.</i>

27
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,827
<i>Now my amulet is now</i> <i>
a hidden immunity idol,</i>

28
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:13,758
<i>which I have to use at six.</i>

29
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:15,137
<i>So I plan</i> <i>
on using that tomorrow.</i>

30
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:16,310
So, win, win, win.

31
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:18,068
Great day for me.

32
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:20,896
Dude, crazy lows, crazy highs.

33
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:23,172
This game's insane.
Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:25,482
Drea took it awesome.
- She took it really well.

35
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:27,827
<i>
Tonight went</i>

36
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:29,724
perfectly.

37
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:31,655
Like, I wanted to unleash
my evil laugh, like...

38
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:36,206
Because my plan
just worked out so well.

39
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:42,413
<i>
My relationship</i> <i>
with Mike right now</i>

40
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:44,206
is right where I want it,
because he sees me

41
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:45,655
as his savior in the game.

42
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,034
Like, I saved his life

43
00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:50,000
<i>and saved his idol</i> <i>
and gave it back to him.</i>

44
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,931
<i>
So my goal</i> <i>
in the next day is to pull</i>

45
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:00,965
Jonathan and Mike apart,

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,827
<i>make them distrust each other,</i> <i>
and know</i>

47
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:05,310
<i>that each other has to go next</i>

48
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:08,137
so that when the time comes,
I can pick a side.

49
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:10,137
And, you know,
it'll be a clean swipe--

50
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,000
Mike or Jonathan out.

51
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,413
- No, I didn't see them.
- Oh, Omie.

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,206
Hey.

53
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:27,965
<i>
We made a great move,</i> <i>
it worked out, but,</i>

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,758
<i>at the end of the day,
people want to get to the end,</i>

55
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:31,482
<i>and they're gonna look
for their best possible angle.</i>

56
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,068
<i>And I know that Omar's</i>

57
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:35,931
afraid of me at the final
because I'm too likable.

58
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:37,931
<i>I wouldn't want to take me</i> <i>
to the end at this point,</i>

59
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:40,551
<i>so I get it. I would try</i> <i>
and cut me loose, too.</i>

60
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:42,206
So I have to do
what comes natural.

61
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,344
I have to cut Omar loose.

62
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,827
So...

63
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:11,482
So, it would be like...

64
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,206
- The merge started, yeah.
- Okay?

65
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:21,551
Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:24,275
<i>
Right now, I need to prove</i> <i>
to Maryanne that Omar</i>

67
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,275
<i>is not her pawn,</i> <i>
and he's working against her.</i>

68
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,275
I'm setting the game plan
in motion.

69
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,931
<i>I just got to nourish it,</i> <i>
and in this game,</i>

70
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:32,758
<i>you got to not go too fast,</i>

71
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:34,620
<i>not be down their throat,</i> <i>
let them</i>

72
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:36,862
make their own decision,
but you give 'em a little nudge.

73
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:46,103
<i>
Mike is right.</i>

74
00:03:46,137 --> 00:03:50,068
<i>At Tribal Council, what the jury</i> <i>
saw was Omar just go</i>

75
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:51,931
from a caterpillar
to a butterfly.

76
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,758
This was someone who was sitting
in the background and, like,

77
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:56,758
boom, he's the reason
why Drea wa-was gone.

78
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:58,482
<i>And I'm like, "There is no way</i> <i>
that I can beat him."</i>

79
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:00,379
<i>So I'm thinking,</i>

80
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:03,034
being like, "Okay, there always
comes a time in this game

81
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:05,241
"when you have people
that you trust,

82
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:07,344
"but the people that you trust,
if you know they can beat you,

83
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,896
you have to do something."

84
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,103
Okay.

85
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:13,689
Okay.

86
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:15,068
Oh.

87
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,862
<i>
I'm thinking right now</i>

88
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,517
<i>about, like, backstabbing one
of my alliance, and I'm, like,</i>

89
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:27,000
this is honestly a hard decision
'cause I know Omar

90
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,551
and I love Omar
and I trust Omar,

91
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:30,689
and Omar's one of the people
who's grounded me

92
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:32,241
<i>these past 22 days.</i>

93
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,517
<i>But if I don't make this move,</i>

94
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:37,724
I'm not going to win,
and it's terrifying.

95
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:41,310
Yeah.

96
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,413
Because...

97
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:27,896
Mm-hmm.

98
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:30,517
<i>My plan now is,</i> <i>
I want Jonathan gone.</i>

99
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,103
<i>I can't have him here</i> <i>
long enough</i>

100
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:34,379
<i>that he has another chance</i> <i>
to win another immunity.</i>

101
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:36,275
His ability to win challenges
is a huge threat.

102
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,620
I don't want him
to keep winning challenges.

103
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:39,344
<i>He's my main nemesis in that.</i>

104
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,862
Like, if he's gone,
I will win them.

105
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:46,310
Mm-hmm.

106
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,000
"But I can't promise you yet."

107
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:57,241
She was very honest with me.

108
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,310
So she...

109
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:05,448
What was her word?

110
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,551
No, no. Come over.

111
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:10,655
We're talking about...
what's going on.

112
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,862
You know, we're just talking

113
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,000
- about with the vote last night.
- Oh, yeah.

114
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:16,206
<i>
At this point,</i>

115
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,551
I don't trust Lindsay
and Omar anymore.

116
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,758
<i>Omar thinks that I don't see it,</i>

117
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:23,413
<i>Lindsay thinks</i> <i>
that I don't see it, but</i>

118
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:25,931
they're working together
very closely.

119
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:29,206
I know, right?

120
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,551
<i>
I'm not letting anyone see</i>

121
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:33,103
<i>that I'm upset
about what happened last night--</i>

122
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:36,379
<i>that Omar used a move that</i>

123
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:40,310
made him go way, way higher
in the jury vote,

124
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:43,482
<i>and I'm not letting Lindsay see</i> <i>
that I'm not happy</i>

125
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:45,827
she's back, you know,
because the truth is,

126
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:47,448
they both have to go.

127
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:50,137
If I'm going to win this game,
I need to get them out.

128
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:51,620
Final six. Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:53,310
<i>
Taku four has made it</i> <i>
to the final six,</i>

130
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,758
<i>and that's as far</i> <i>
as they're going to go.</i>

131
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:58,413
<i>We're not going to go</i> <i>
any further together. It's...</i>

132
00:06:58,448 --> 00:06:59,793
it's time to break up.

133
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:11,724
Come on in.

134
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:24,310
All right, ready to get
to today's reward challenge?

135
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,103
<i>
For today's challenge,</i>

136
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:30,344
<i>you're going to spin</i> <i>
to unspool a coil of rope.</i>

137
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,655
<i>You'll then make your way</i> <i>
through a series of obstacles</i>

138
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,275
<i>and collect a key.</i>

139
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,551
<i>You'll use that key</i> <i>
to unlock puzzle pieces</i>

140
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:39,034
<i>and use the pieces</i> <i>
to solve a block puzzle.</i>

141
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,517
<i>First to finish</i>

142
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,206
wins reward. Want to know
what you're playing for?

143
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:46,448
Today, you're in charge.

144
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:49,448
You will have a choice.
You can choose sustenance--

145
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,793
grilled chicken and veggies--

146
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:54,517
or you can choose decadence--

147
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,827
chocolate cake and cookies,

148
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:59,482
which might be the sugar
that you crave.

149
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:02,413
- Ooh.
- You'll be in charge. Worth playing for?

150
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,413
- Absolutely.
- Yes. All right.

151
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:05,000
We'll draw for spots.
We'll get started.

152
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:06,551
- Let's do it, final six!
- Yes.

153
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:15,137
Here we go. For reward.

154
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:16,379
Survivors ready.

155
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:20,896
Go!

156
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:24,068
- You're spinning to unspool.
- Aah!

157
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,034
- The faster you go, the quicker you get there.
- Oh!

158
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:28,689
But the dizzier. Maryanne takes the first fall.

159
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:30,000
Still smiling.

160
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:34,137
Jonathan in the lead.

161
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:36,206
- And it's Lindsay and Mike.
- Aah! I can't see anything!

162
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:38,517
- Oh, my gosh.
- Maryanne is off the course.

163
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:43,000
Jonathan across the net.

164
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:44,344
There goes Lindsay.
There goes Maryanne.

165
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,379
Aah!

166
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:49,241
Lindsay tearing up those knees.

167
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:51,551
Man!
Now you got to get on the beam.

168
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:55,482
If you fall off,
you got to start again.

169
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:58,172
Maryanne's dizzy. Jonathan's
dizzy. He's coming back.

170
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:01,724
Here comes Romeo. Maryanne is
now trying to unspin

171
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:04,620
to reverse her dizziness.

172
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:06,000
Never seen anything like it.

173
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:10,137
Jonathan untying his key.

174
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:14,517
Lindsay trying
to stay on the beam

175
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:17,310
by using the rope to balance.

176
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,344
Mike drops.
He's got to go back.

177
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:22,862
Jonathan first across.
He's got the key.

178
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,034
Start unlocking those pieces.

179
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:32,965
Lindsay's good.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,586
And Lindsay is across.
Start working on your puzzle.

181
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,310
Omar working on his key,

182
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,000
Mike working on his key. Ooh.

183
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:43,586
Omar has his key,
and you're across. You're good.

184
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,517
You're good, Romeo.

185
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,862
Mike's got a rhythm now.
Just get across. You're good.

186
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,793
You're good. Maryanne can
start working on her puzzle.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,344
You're building a compass rose

188
00:09:57,482 --> 00:10:00,862
piece by piece,
and you're studying as you go,

189
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:03,758
making sure it's right.

190
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:07,103
If you're right,
it's just a matter of time

191
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:09,724
before disappointment smacks you
in the face.

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,241
Sometimes it's fun
to just listen

193
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:17,689
to the sounds of the challenge.

194
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,862
This is hard.

195
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,689
Maryanne continues
to add pieces.

196
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:38,517
She was dead last to the puzzle,

197
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:43,068
and now she's down to a few
pieces left if she's right.

198
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:45,448
What am I doing wrong?
There's something wrong.

199
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:49,517
Now Omar with momentum.

200
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,965
It's now Omar in the lead,

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,068
Maryanne trying to catch Omar.

202
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,206
Oh, my gosh.

203
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,034
Omar with another piece.

204
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:08,103
No, that's wrong.

205
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:12,000
Jeff?
Omar thinks he has it.

206
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:14,034
- How confident are you?
- 100%?

207
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:18,137
Omar wins!
Nice!

208
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:20,000
Nice job, Omar.
- Great job!
Nice job!

209
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,517
Oh, good job.
I had it, too.

210
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:22,551
I was right... I finally got
to the right track.

211
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:24,000
Nice.

212
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:26,586
Great job. I'm proud of you.

213
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,413
Good job.

214
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:32,172
Omar, come on over.

215
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:34,689
- Whew.
- Whew. Good job, Omar.

216
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:35,827
Thank you.
- Nice job, Omie.

217
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:36,724
I never thought
I'd be next to you.

218
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,413
- Really?
- No.

219
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,482
You didn't think so?
- You surprise yourself out here.

220
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:41,137
- Yeah.
- You don't know what you're

221
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:43,034
capable of
until you have to do it.

222
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,758
- So...
- What surprised you about today?

223
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,344
Which part of this challenge?

224
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:48,517
I thought I was going
to blow through the puzzle,

225
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,172
but it was actually
really, really hard.

226
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:53,137
And my niece is afraid
to try anything new.

227
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,862
And I was terrified of
all the challenges, and I hope

228
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,137
she sees this,
and it inspires her

229
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:58,206
earlier in life
to take those risks.

230
00:11:58,241 --> 00:11:59,172
- 'Cause she's only eight.
- What's your...?

231
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:00,965
- What's your niece's name?
- Hannah.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,275
Okay, so, Hannah, you're eight,
and there are millions

233
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,551
of other eight, nine,
ten-year-olds just like you.

234
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:10,551
Hear that message because
that is what <i>Survivor</i> is about.

235
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:14,241
- It is about pushing yourself to your personal limit...
- Yeah.

236
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,241
and then seeing
if you got one more step.

237
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:19,103
That's what you've been doing
for 22 days. Today,

238
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,103
you did it.
You're in charge.

239
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:22,655
- You have a couple of decisions to make.
- Okay.

240
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:25,482
You're going to decide,
do you want sustenance--

241
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,103
which is
grilled chicken and veggies--

242
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,793
or if you want chocolate cake
and cookies.

243
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:31,379
- Here's the additional twist.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:33,379
The invitation
with grilled chicken and veggies

245
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:35,310
includes two players.

246
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:36,896
- Okay.
- The invitation

247
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:40,000
with chocolate cake and cookies
includes three.

248
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:43,827
- Oh, man.
- So now you have a very big dilemma.

249
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,827
You know,
we're all really out here

250
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:48,241
and really, really deprived,
so I think

251
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:51,241
I'm going to give
some more people...

252
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:54,000
And I'm really sorry
for the two I don't choose.

253
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:56,379
All right,
so you're going to take

254
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:58,241
chocolate cake and cookies,
and you're going to bring

255
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:00,379
three people with you,
which means

256
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,000
two will not participate
in this.

257
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:04,827
There's one person here
who's eaten nothing,

258
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:06,275
so I can't not pick Romeo.

259
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,793
Good job, Romeo.
Yeah!

260
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:09,655
Come on over, Romeo.
Yeah, Romeo.

261
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:13,689
The second person
I'm gonna pick is Maryanne.

262
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:15,793
She's been struggling, and
I think she could use a meal.

263
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:18,827
Come on over, Maryanne.
- Thank you.

264
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:22,379
One spot left,
so either Lindsay,

265
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:24,344
Mike or Jonathan is going
to join you,

266
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:25,965
and the other two will not.

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,344
For me, at this point, honestly,

268
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,000
it's really about who I think

269
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:33,344
would benefit from it the most,
and I want the other two

270
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,724
to eat all of our rice today.

271
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:37,862
So, Mike, come and eat
some chocolate cake.

272
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:40,275
Nice job, Mike.
- Thank.. thank you.

273
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,275
Thank you, Omar.
You're welcome.

274
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,689
All right,
everybody heading back to camp.

275
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,724
You four are gonna have
a nice, decadent afternoon.

276
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,517
You two, got nothing for you.

277
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:51,034
- Thank you, Mr. Jeff.
- Thanks, Jeff. Thank you.

278
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:53,103
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

279
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:55,034
<i>To win a</i> Survivor <i>challenge?</i>

280
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,965
It felt like I was
at the top of the world.

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,379
<i>But the caveat is</i> <i>
which reward I picked.</i>

282
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,517
You know, it changes the number
of people you bring with you.

283
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,034
<i>So, for me, I thought</i> <i>
it would go a longer way</i>

284
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:06,793
<i>towards building relationships,</i>

285
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:09,206
<i>giving more people</i> <i>
some sustenance, and I hope</i>

286
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:11,448
there's no backlash
to the decision I made.

287
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:27,965
Wow.
Wow.

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,448
Omar, you take the first,
whatever you want, pal.

289
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,103
Holy cow.
Uh, cheers.

290
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,517
Wait. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

291
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:34,379
- Cheers. Thank you, Omar.
- You're welcome.

292
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:37,344
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

293
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,310
<i>Today's reward challenge</i> <i>
was exhilarating because</i>

294
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:43,000
I just won a <i>Survivor</i> challenge,
which I never thought

295
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:44,827
I would ever do in my life.

296
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,172
Come on.

297
00:14:46,206 --> 00:14:47,689
Mm-hmm.

298
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:50,137
Romeo, I'm very happy for you.

299
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,344
Mm-hmm.
- Thank you for bringing me back

300
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:53,000
from the dead.

301
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:55,482
Well, you-you deserve it.
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,551
Everybody here deserves it.
I just feel bad for them.

303
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,000
I know how... gassed
Jonathan is,

304
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:00,827
and Lindsay chose me
for the other one.

305
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:04,344
But I was like
"I'm just trying to be fair."

306
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,517
<i>At this point,</i> <i>
Mike and Jonathan are</i>

307
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:09,413
<i>two very open targets</i> <i>
that I want out of the game.</i>

308
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:11,758
<i>So leaving Jonathan behind</i> <i>
at camp was</i>

309
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:13,517
maybe to deprive him
a little bit,

310
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,413
make him less energetic
for tomorrow's challenge

311
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,172
'cause I need to beat him.

312
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:23,931
No, I'm not bitter at all.
I understand the reason.

313
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,931
He's going to try
to get them comfortable.

314
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:29,689
- Mm-hmm.
- And then blindside Mike is the plan.

315
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:31,689
That's what I'm thinking.

316
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,655
I didn't get
any confirmation on that,

317
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:37,551
but I assume
that would be the plan.

318
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:40,931
<i>
When Lindsay and I are
discussing the vote over rice,</i>

319
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:44,586
<i>we are obviously trying</i> <i>
to fool each other.</i>

320
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,724
<i>And right now
Mike and I are very tight, but</i>

321
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:49,896
I don't think Lindsay really
wants to vote for Mike. No.

322
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:51,896
I think she would much rather
vote me out

323
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:55,000
<i>because I'm a bigger threat</i> <i>
when it comes to challenges.</i>

324
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:58,034
<i>So I'm just trying</i> <i>
to get her comfortable,</i>

325
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:00,724
<i>and she's trying</i> <i>
to get me comfortable.</i>

326
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:02,551
Hopefully, I'm doing
a better job than she's doing

327
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,172
because I know
that she's up to something.

328
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,517
- I'm gonna lay down.
- Okay.

329
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:08,517
- Take it easy.
- Okay.

330
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,620
<i>Jonathan thinks</i> <i>
that Mike is going home.</i>

331
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,793
<i>That's great because</i>

332
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,862
people actually
want Jonathan out first.

333
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,551
<i>The only thing that's going
to be a real challenge is, like,</i>

334
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:19,103
if Jonathan wins immunity,
Mike is abs...

335
00:16:19,137 --> 00:16:20,620
is absolutely the target.

336
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:21,965
Hi!

337
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,344
<i>So I need him</i> <i>
to feel comfortable</i>

338
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,448
<i>that it's Jonathan going home.</i>

339
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,034
- Am I safe?
- It has to be Jonathan,

340
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:34,310
is basically what needs
to happen.

341
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:36,000
Okay. Am I safe?

342
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,689
- I'm asking you straight up.
- I'm ask...

343
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:39,103
I'm telling you, if it's...

344
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:41,655
If Jonathan doesn't win,
you are safe.

345
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:44,379
<i>
Am I feeling safe?</i> <i>
Absolutely not.</i>

346
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:46,482
I have to go with my gut.
My gut says

347
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:48,896
<i>Omar is now gunning for me.</i>

348
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:51,275
- You are the next biggest threat after Jonathan.
- Okay.

349
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,172
That-that's how some people
feel. Me and Omar don't.

350
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:56,655
<i>
And Lindsay-- she's playing</i> <i>
the game with-with Omar.</i>

351
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:58,137
<i>I can't be 100%</i>

352
00:16:58,172 --> 00:16:59,827
positive, but I can't see
how they're not.

353
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:01,241
I'll let you know
if you need to use your idol,

354
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,137
- uh, tomorrow night.
- Okay.

355
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:10,241
<i>
In talking with Lindsay,</i> <i>
it clicked in my head.</i>

356
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,586
Lindsay has an idol.
When Drea went out,

357
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,758
her-her amulet became
a full idol.

358
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:15,689
You... How long can
you-you... you can use...?

359
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:17,965
Okay.

360
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,965
<i>So at this point, I have</i> <i>
to obviously protect myself.</i>

361
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,758
<i>So I think my best move now
is to tell Jonathan and Maryanne</i>

362
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,413
<i>that Lindsay has an idol and</i>

363
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:27,241
make sure they're on my side.

364
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:33,586
Uh-uh.

365
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:37,965
Mm-hmm.

366
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,379
Mm-hmm.

367
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:46,206
<i>
Anybody has to win this one</i> <i>
except for Lindsay</i>

368
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:49,068
<i>or Omar, of course, because</i>

369
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:51,034
what if she says, "Let me keep
my alliance strong with Omar.

370
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:53,931
"I'll give him my idol,

371
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:56,586
<i>and now we're both safe"?</i> <i>
That would be</i>

372
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,931
a very, very big damper
on my plans.

373
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:01,448
- And so, if they take me out first, guess who's next.
- Me.

374
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:03,551
- If they take you out first, guess who's next.
- You.

375
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:08,206
- 'Cause...
- Exactly.

376
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,655
Mm-hmm.

377
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:15,172
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

378
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:16,965
Mm-hmm.

379
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,758
<i>This vote is extremely huge</i> <i>
for me.</i>

380
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:20,172
<i>Maryanne has two votes,</i>

381
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:22,000
so we need to work together.

382
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,172
<i>And I'm thinking,</i> <i>
"I'll make a deal with you.</i>

383
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:25,827
<i>"If you save my life</i>

384
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:28,482
"and help me get to five,
I have the idol

385
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:30,310
that'll help me and you
get to four."

386
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:31,482
The oldest and the youngest.

387
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:33,620
- The bookends.
- The bookends.

388
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,344
So, Mike tells me that he wants</i>

389
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:38,275
to play his idol
for me at the final five.

390
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,172
<i>But I already have an idol.</i>

391
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:43,620
And I'm here like,
"Are you kidding me?"

392
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,413
<i>This means</i> <i>
that I'm double safe, so</i>

393
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:47,931
I'm on for this plan for Omar.

394
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:49,689
Like, we have to get him out
as soon as we can,

395
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:51,827
and that means
at the next vote.

396
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:53,827
And even if he wins immunity,
we still have the votes.

397
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:55,827
Right. Who...?
Yeah, who do we go for then?

398
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:57,448
- This we have to talk about.
- Um...

399
00:18:57,482 --> 00:18:58,931
Uh, Jonathan's on our side.

400
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:00,344
Then Lindsay? 'Cause, look...

401
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:02,482
No, Lindsay has immunity.

402
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,103
Lindsay has immunity?

403
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:09,586
- For final six?
- Yes. It's only good till final six.

404
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,206
No.

405
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,137
<i>
So, Mike tells me</i> <i>
that Lindsay has some sort</i>

406
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:22,827
<i>of amulet,
which is a hidden immunity idol.</i>

407
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,827
So that means that, like,
I'm out of the loop with her.

408
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:27,758
<i>And, like, at this point,</i> <i>
my heart dropped</i>

409
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,655
<i>because I thought we were close.</i>

410
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:31,758
But basically I'm just
like a sacrificial lamb to her.

411
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:35,620
<i>So, I just have to keep on</i> <i>
holding into that hope</i>

412
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:38,379
<i>that my move that I've been
thinking about won't be ruined</i>

413
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:40,206
<i>and that I'll be able</i> <i>
to show people</i>

414
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:42,068
that I'm a real contender
in this game,

415
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:44,413
not just a goat to be herded.

416
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:05,965
Come on in.

417
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:10,482
Still smiling.

418
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:12,068
Always.

419
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:14,724
Day 23 of the best,

420
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:16,034
worst experience of your life.

421
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:17,448
Yeah, it's true.

422
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,241
And you're still smiling.

423
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:25,758
All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

424
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,793
First things first, Jonathan.

425
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,482
I got to take it back.

426
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:31,482
I'm coming back.

427
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:33,172
All right.

428
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:40,275
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

429
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:43,068
For today's challenge,

430
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:45,896
<i>you're gonna race over</i> <i>
a series of obstacles,</i>

431
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:47,896
<i>then across a bridge</i> <i>
containing puzzle steps.</i>

432
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:50,517
<i>You'll use those steps</i> <i>
to build a staircase.</i>

433
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:54,413
<i>You'll then maneuver a bag</i> <i>
of balls to the top</i>

434
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:56,310
<i>of a very tall tower.</i> <i>
Once there,</i>

435
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:59,413
<i>you'll use those balls</i> <i>
to finish a table maze.</i>

436
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:04,310
<i>First player</i> <i>
to land both their balls...</i>

437
00:21:04,344 --> 00:21:09,275
wins immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final five.

438
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,103
Losers, Tribal Council,

439
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,862
where, after 23 days, your dream

440
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:16,551
of winning this show
will come to an end,

441
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:18,827
and the only thing you will have
to do with the million dollars

442
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,586
is deciding who gets it.

443
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,724
Big, big stakes.

444
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:25,275
- Shall we do it? All right.
- Yeah!
- Absolutely.

445
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,241
We'll draw for spots. We'll get started.

446
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,344
All right, here we go.

447
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,965
For a guaranteed spot
in the final five.

448
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,827
Survivors ready. Go!

449
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:44,655
First you're going
over these obstacles.

450
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,689
Doesn't matter how.
Just get over 'em.

451
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,310
Jonathan in the lead,
Lindsay on his tail.

452
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:52,482
There goes Mike.

453
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:57,448
Now you're untying the steps

454
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,000
you need
to build your staircase.

455
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:02,586
They're in batches of four.

456
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,689
Jonathan's out first
with his first four planks.

457
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:09,379
Everybody's getting
their planks together now.

458
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,724
We're tight early on.

459
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:13,413
Jonathan in a bit
of an early lead.

460
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:15,551
Here comes Romeo. Look at that!

461
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:18,793
Lindsay. Here comes Mike.
Now we got Omar.

462
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:21,413
Let's go, Maryanne.

463
00:22:21,448 --> 00:22:26,724
They will go in one of the first
four spots on your staircase.

464
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:30,379
The question is,
which spots do they go in?

465
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:34,413
This is where
time is gained or lost.

466
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:37,034
And look at that.
Lindsay now in the lead.

467
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:39,241
She's getting
her next batch of pieces.

468
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,413
There goes Maryanne.
Omar's in on it.

469
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:45,103
Jonathan falling behind now.
He lost the lead.

470
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:46,931
There goes Mike.

471
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,103
Lindsay has her next four.
She's heading back.

472
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:52,034
Omar has his next four.
He's heading back.

473
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:55,517
Jonathan has his untied.

474
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:59,068
The next four pieces go
in the next four steps.

475
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:01,586
Jonathan is back.
Here comes Mike.

476
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,931
First you have to get
the pieces.

477
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,448
Then you have
to solve the puzzle.

478
00:23:07,482 --> 00:23:10,241
He heads out.
Lindsay now heads out.

479
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:13,310
It's Omar and Lindsay
right now side by side.

480
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:15,344
Jonathan's done.
He's heading back.

481
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:17,448
Mike's good.

482
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,482
Omar, in the lead, continues.

483
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:25,793
He's back first.
Lindsay right behind.

484
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:27,241
Jonathan trying to get in on it.

485
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:30,551
It's day 23 of <i>Survivor 42.</i>

486
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:32,862
Six players left.

487
00:23:32,896 --> 00:23:34,931
You got to step up,
or you go home.

488
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:39,586
Omar first to the top.

489
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,655
Lindsay right behind.

490
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:42,724
Now you have
to maneuver the balls

491
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:44,034
you need for the table maze

492
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:45,862
to get to the top of the tower.

493
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:49,413
Jonathan is stuck. Something is
not right. What is it?

494
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:52,241
You got to find the way it fits.

495
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:55,310
Mike is through. He's now
working on his table maze balls.

496
00:23:55,344 --> 00:23:57,344
Lindsay working her way
to the top.

497
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:58,862
Omar working his way to the top.

498
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,517
Lindsay going to get
to the top first.

499
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:04,413
She's got her ring. She's up.
It's now Lindsay in the lead.

500
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:06,379
Jonathan on his last piece
of the staircase.

501
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:09,724
Jonathan's now up.
He's working on his.

502
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:12,310
It's Jonathan, Omar and Mike
trying to get to the top.

503
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:13,689
Lindsay's already there.

504
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:15,551
Romeo working on his staircase.

505
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:17,689
Maryanne
on her last four pieces.

506
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:21,724
Jonathan now up here.
Here comes Mike.

507
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:23,413
Here comes Omar.

508
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,655
We got four people
on the table maze.

509
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:29,862
This is where the challenge
will be won or lost, right here.

510
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:32,413
Everybody dead even
right now. You've got to land

511
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:35,379
the first ball,
the closest ball, first.

512
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:37,068
Lindsay very close.

513
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:39,827
But around the corner now.

514
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:41,206
Lindsay drops.

515
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:42,758
She's got to start again.
Mike drops.

516
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:45,517
Keep working, Maryanne.

517
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,482
Jonathan has won
two individual immunities.

518
00:24:47,517 --> 00:24:50,137
Lindsay has won one.

519
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:53,379
Omar and Mike have yet
to win individual immunity.

520
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:57,344
Jonathan very close

521
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:59,689
to landing that first ball,
and he does. Jonathan now

522
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:01,551
in the lead with his first ball.
One ball left.

523
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:04,655
It's Lindsay very close
to landing her first ball.

524
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:08,000
And she has it.
Now it's Lindsay and Jonathan.

525
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:10,275
Mike has to start again.

526
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,620
Omar trying
to get something going.

527
00:25:11,655 --> 00:25:14,413
Here comes Romeo.
He's gonna get in on it.

528
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:17,620
Jonathan working around
a tough part of this maze,

529
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:20,586
one of the toughest corners
to maneuver.

530
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,793
Lindsay right behind him.

531
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:25,000
They are side by side,
same spot in the maze.

532
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:28,551
Almost same spot where their
balls are, on opposite sides.

533
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:32,586
Both maneuvering the same corner
at the same time.

534
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,965
Lindsay drops. She's got
to go back. Jonathan makes it.

535
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,965
Jonathan has
one small section left.

536
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The most difficult section
of the maze.

537
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:44,827
Jonathan very close
to winning it.

538
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:46,034
Shoot, Jonathan. Idiot.
Jonathan drops.

539
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:47,103
Loses everything.

540
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:49,827
Romeo, no luck.

541
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:51,586
Mike trying
to get something going.

542
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,241
Here comes Maryanne.
Keep working, Maryanne.

543
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:57,896
Now Lindsay
in that three-quarter spot.

544
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,172
Jonathan right there with her.

545
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,379
Jonathan and Lindsay
once again

546
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:04,448
side by side in a challenge,

547
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:06,965
in a showdown
right now to win it.

548
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,793
Jonathan is around the corner first,

549
00:26:08,827 --> 00:26:10,482
and he navigated it safely.

550
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,448
There goes Lindsay.
She's navigated it.

551
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:14,482
Jonathan can sense it.

552
00:26:16,137 --> 00:26:19,448
Lindsay on the edge, saves it.

553
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:21,241
Jonathan right on her tail.

554
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:23,689
Lindsay very close to winning.

555
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:25,551
It's in, and it's out.

556
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:27,724
Jonathan drops.

557
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:31,413
- And it's in! Lindsay does it!
- Oh, yeah!

558
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:32,931
Individual immunity.

559
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:35,758
Safe tonight at Tribal Council

560
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:39,586
- and guaranteed a spot in the final five.
- Nice job, man.

561
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,344
Wow, what a challenge.

562
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:42,965
That was close.

563
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:47,655
Lindsay, come on over.

564
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,517
Good job, Linds.

565
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:52,827
For the second time this season,
individual immunity is yours.

566
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,862
You are safe tonight,
cannot be voted out,

567
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:58,172
which means you have
a spot in the final five.

568
00:26:58,206 --> 00:27:00,586
As for the rest of you,
a different story.

569
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,172
Somebody's dream
of winning <i>Survivor 42</i>

570
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,379
will be over.

571
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:06,379
Tribal Council tonight.

572
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:08,000
Somebody gonna
head over to the jury.

573
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:11,068
It is also the last time the
Shot in the Dark can be used--

574
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:13,206
tonight's Tribal Council.

575
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:14,862
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

576
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:16,379
- See you tonight at Tribal. Congrats.
- Thank you.

577
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:17,413
Thank you, Jeff.

578
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:19,482
<i>I didn't want Lindsay to win</i>

579
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:22,517
because I know
that Lindsay has an idol

580
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:23,862
<i>that's only good up till six.</i>

581
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:24,862
<i>That's tonight.</i>

582
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:27,034
<i>If she plays the idol,</i> <i>
Omar is now safe.</i>

583
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:29,379
<i>So I'm thinking plan B</i> <i>
got to come into effect.</i>

584
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:38,586
<i>
Congrats!</i>

585
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,655
<i>Great job.</i> <i>
Another great job by Lindsay.</i>

586
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:43,655
Thank you.
Great job.

587
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:44,896
Thanks. That was a fun one.

588
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:48,137
<i>I feel freaking awesome.</i> <i>
Came down to me and Jonathan</i>

589
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:49,586
at the end once again.

590
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,137
Jonathan, how close were you
to landing the second one?

591
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:52,758
Very close.
- Aw.

592
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:54,379
But close in this game
means nothing.

593
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:56,551
- Bummer.
- Good job, Lindsay.

594
00:27:56,586 --> 00:27:59,034
<i>
Jonathan is this</i> <i>
giant Goliath of a human.</i>

595
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:02,724
And then you have me,
half his size and a female,

596
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:03,724
<i>and I freaking won it.</i>

597
00:28:03,758 --> 00:28:05,827
<i>I won that challenge.</i>

598
00:28:05,862 --> 00:28:07,620
Like, that's awesome.
Like, that's so cool.

599
00:28:07,655 --> 00:28:09,034
Great job.

600
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:10,689
Oh, gosh.

601
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,724
<i>Lindsay winning</i> <i>
was the number one thing</i>

602
00:28:17,758 --> 00:28:19,620
I did not want to happen.

603
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:20,724
You want to taste some?

604
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:21,896
It really just tastes
like a cucumber.

605
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:22,758
<i>
Because now she can use</i>

606
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:24,896
<i>her idol to help Omar.</i>

607
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:26,965
<i>And if Omar doesn't go home,</i>

608
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,551
<i>then Mike and I</i> <i>
are the biggest targets.</i>

609
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:32,344
So Mike and I
are gonna vote Romeo.

610
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:35,413
Just coconut is the only thing
that's been in here.

611
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:42,931
<i>
Jonathan thinks</i> <i>
that Mike is going home,</i>

612
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:45,724
<i>but all of us have been thinking</i> <i>
that if Jonathan loses,</i>

613
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,758
<i>he is leaving tonight.</i>

614
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:51,379
So that is the plan
that I hope to just sink in.

615
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,448
- Jonathan needs to go.
- Okay.

616
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,448
- Jonathan's a huge liability to stay.
- Exactly.

617
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:57,275
Like, the fact that
he didn't win today

618
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,689
- was, like...
- We have to take that opport...

619
00:28:58,724 --> 00:28:59,551
We have to.
- Okay, yeah. So...

620
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:01,172
<i>
I don't see why</i>

621
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,310
<i>anyone would veer off from
this plan to vote Jonathan out.</i>

622
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,034
Yes.

623
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:07,310
Like, that has to...
That's, like, a no-brainer.

624
00:29:14,344 --> 00:29:17,241
<i>
Jonathan has been a target</i> <i>
since early on.</i>

625
00:29:17,275 --> 00:29:19,620
<i>I've been on the chopping block</i> <i>
every Tribal Council.</i>

626
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:21,517
<i>So it only makes sense</i> <i>
to get rid of him,</i>

627
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,862
because then
the backup person would be who?

628
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:24,724
Most likely me.

629
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:31,655
...are 100% on Jonathan.

630
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:34,172
- So you need to be on Jonathan, too.
- Okay. Okay.

631
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,103
We're heading into
Tribal Council in a few hours,

632
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:38,103
and right now the plan is set.

633
00:29:38,137 --> 00:29:41,827
<i>Jonathan's gonna go home,</i> <i>
and if there's a backup vote,</i>

634
00:29:41,862 --> 00:29:42,965
<i>you know, have that be Mike.</i>

635
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,103
It's definitely not me tonight?

636
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:46,448
No, definitely not you.

637
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:48,517
<i>It's Mike going after Jonathan,</i> <i>
Jonathan going after Mike.</i>

638
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:51,206
And if that's the case,
our plan is foolproof.

639
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:01,103
Mm-hmm.

640
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:04,862
This could be perfect.

641
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:07,275
Everybody is on board
to get rid of Jonathan tonight.

642
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:10,275
Yeah.

643
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:14,103
Yeah.

644
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:15,689
Tonight, if anything is crazy,</i>

645
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:18,000
<i>I do have my amulet,
which is a hidden immunity idol.</i>

646
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:19,827
<i>But I'd rather not play it,</i>

647
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,413
<i>because once somebody</i> <i>
plays an idol,</i>

648
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:23,551
<i>it usually goes right back out</i> <i>
for somebody to find.</i>

649
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:25,965
And we don't want
to worry about an idol

650
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,448
being back in circulation
on the island.

651
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:34,379
Yeah, okay. <i>
Jonathan will be out</i> <i>as planned,</i>

652
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:36,413
<i>and then me and Omar</i> <i>
have a nice</i>

653
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:39,482
cruising out to final four
and make it to the end.

654
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,206
Flame.

655
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:48,206
<i>Right now, I'm feeling that
Omar can win this whole thing.</i>

656
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:50,034
<i>And that's not a feeling</i> <i>
that I want to have.</i>

657
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:51,034
Flame on.

658
00:30:51,068 --> 00:30:52,758
<i>
I feel dejected,</i>

659
00:30:52,793 --> 00:30:54,448
<i>but I want to show that I'm here</i>

660
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:56,034
<i>to play my game,</i> <i>
and I'm here to win.</i>

661
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:58,793
<i>I have my extra vote.</i>

662
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:00,275
<i>I can go with</i> <i>
Omar and Lindsay's plan</i>

663
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,137
<i>and use my extra vote</i>

664
00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:06,000
the way they want me to,
or I can go with my plan

665
00:31:06,034 --> 00:31:08,517
<i>and use my extra vote</i> <i>
the way I want to.</i>

666
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:11,103
<i>So there's a chance
that this plan to take out Omar</i>

667
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:12,793
- can still happen. <i>
- Listen to me.</i>

668
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:13,620
Okay.

669
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:18,000
This is our time to take a risk,
but a big move.

670
00:31:18,034 --> 00:31:19,827
- Okay. Okay.
- This is what you're going to do, okay?

671
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,965
You're going to tell Jonathan,
"Vote Omar."

672
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,068
Then...

673
00:31:24,103 --> 00:31:26,482
- I know for a fact Jonathan is voting Romeo with me.
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:30,034
- Okay.
- And if you throw two votes Romeo, and I vote Romeo,

675
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:31,862
there's nothing anybody can do.

676
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:33,862
Omar's next one. He has no,
he has no protection.

677
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:36,172
- It's me, you...
- But what if he wins tomorrow?

678
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:37,448
I want to vote for Omar.

679
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,137
<i>I could use my idol</i> <i>
tonight, but</i>

680
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:43,965
it's not gonna happen.

681
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,689
<i>I need my idol tomorrow
to make sure that I get to four.</i>

682
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,931
It's my life. My life's hanging
on the balance.

683
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:50,758
I'm putting my life
in your hands. Please.

684
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:51,862
I can't promise you right now.

685
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:54,310
I still need to think about it.
That's the thing.

686
00:31:54,344 --> 00:31:56,103
<i>
Lindsay wins</i> <i>
the immunity challenge.</i>

687
00:31:56,137 --> 00:31:58,137
She doesn't need
her immunity idol.

688
00:31:58,172 --> 00:32:01,034
<i>I'm thinking Lindsay</i> <i>
gives Omar her immunity idol.</i>

689
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:03,758
<i>It would make them both safe.</i>

690
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:08,034
<i>So the easy thing is,</i> <i>
put four votes on Romeo.</i>

691
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:10,655
<i>Simple, except Maryanne</i>

692
00:32:10,689 --> 00:32:14,689
<i>wants to play</i> Survivor <i>18.0,</i> <i>
instead of 2.0.</i>

693
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,724
<i>And having my fate</i> <i>
in her hands</i>

694
00:32:16,758 --> 00:32:18,137
is scary.

695
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:19,517
- But you're not voting for me, right?
- I'm not.

696
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:20,655
Okay.

697
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,172
- I'm not.
- Okay.

698
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,206
Like, I gave you my word,
and I'm keeping my word.

699
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:25,862
Okay. <i>
Mike is just trying</i> <i>to play it safe,</i>

700
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:28,068
<i>'cause people can feel</i> <i>
the final five.</i>

701
00:32:28,103 --> 00:32:29,551
<i>And when people can feel it,</i> <i>
and they don't have</i>

702
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:31,413
<i>that necklace on their neck,</i> <i>
they get paranoid.</i>

703
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:34,206
<i>But I have my extra vote,</i>

704
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:37,586
and my two votes
give me a lot of power tonight.

705
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,896
Nothing from this
conversation can leak.

706
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:41,034
- Nothing.
- I swear.

707
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:42,586
- We have six votes.
- Yes.

708
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:51,137
- Oh, my God.
- Used... And it has to be used this Tribal.

709
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:54,379
So that means
that us four are five votes.

710
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:56,068
This is what we need to do.

711
00:32:56,103 --> 00:32:59,827
Me, you, Jonathan, Mike

712
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:01,655
vote Omar,
because Omar will win.

713
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:06,379
<i>I think I have Romeo on board,</i> <i>
but I still have</i>

714
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:07,965
a lot of work to do.

715
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,965
- This is simple.
- Mm-hmm.

716
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,034
You two do Romeo.

717
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:12,724
Romeo and I do Omar.

718
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,206
- That is three.
- You do your two?

719
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,034
Yeah, I will do two on Omar.

720
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:17,655
- Okay, do we trust Romeo to vote Omar?
- Okay.

721
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:20,241
I do. I've talked to him.
I literally trust him.

722
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:22,000
<i>
I'm not confident in Romeo</i> <i>
at all.</i>

723
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:24,275
<i>And he's been</i> <i>
very back and forth</i>

724
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,758
throughout the whole game.

725
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:28,758
<i>And if he votes me, then</i> <i>
I could go home.</i>

726
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:31,137
So I think
it would be a dumb move

727
00:33:31,172 --> 00:33:32,655
<i>not to vote out Romeo.</i>

728
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:34,068
So here's my question.

729
00:33:34,103 --> 00:33:36,034
Is it best we just go along
with whatever they say

730
00:33:36,068 --> 00:33:37,379
to all of us,

731
00:33:37,413 --> 00:33:39,758
and we silently
throw our votes on Romeo?

732
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:42,034
Then we're all guaranteed
to be here tomorrow,

733
00:33:42,068 --> 00:33:43,758
and then we get Omar
tomorrow night.

734
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:45,275
- And then, and then... no, no, listen to me.
- Oh, my God.

735
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,655
<i>
Jonathan and Mike</i> <i>
are underestimating me.</i>

736
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:50,206
<i>I'm trying to play</i> <i>
a good move to take out Omar,</i>

737
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:52,103
<i>- and they're just</i> <i>not getting it.</i>
- Look.

738
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:55,241
If we all vote for Romeo,
Romeo is gone,

739
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:57,241
but then our way to the end
is more difficult.

740
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:59,137
This is a risk
that we have to take.

741
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:02,655
<i>I'm going guns blazing to go</i> <i>
and make my move on Omar,</i>

742
00:34:02,689 --> 00:34:04,551
<i>but I am getting frustrated</i>

743
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,689
because I got to make moves
happen for me to get to the end.

744
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:09,344
<i>And the only wrench in my plan,</i>

745
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,379
<i>if I don't get guys</i> <i>
who are literally, like,</i>

746
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:14,379
<i>a foot taller than me</i> <i>
to go and listen to me,</i>

747
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:16,206
then my whole plan
is just gonna go up in smoke.

748
00:34:46,862 --> 00:34:47,965
All right.

749
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,379
Let's get into it. Wow.

750
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:52,379
I can feel intensity tonight.

751
00:34:52,413 --> 00:34:54,517
You were all
looking at me like this.

752
00:34:56,724 --> 00:35:00,000
Omar, is that just being eager,
or was it a crazy day?

753
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:02,241
Or are you anticipating
the rain? What is it?

754
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:04,068
I think it's
a little bit of the fact

755
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,206
that last Tribal Council
was outrageous.

756
00:35:06,241 --> 00:35:09,517
And then we're also
dreading the rain that's coming

757
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:11,931
and wondering, is this Tribal
gonna be outrageous?

758
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,620
Well, I will say,
just since you've sat down,

759
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:17,034
the rain has
increased in intensity

760
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:19,586
by about fourfold, right, Mike? You can feel it. Oh.

761
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,620
Of course.
It's coming.

762
00:35:21,655 --> 00:35:23,551
It matches the intensity
of the place.

763
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:26,758
Quite frankly, I'm at the point
now, this is past calculus.

764
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,103
There's nowhere to hide,

765
00:35:28,137 --> 00:35:30,241
and there's only very few people
you can talk to.

766
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,241
Romeo, you get back to camp.

767
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:34,793
Lindsay has her second
individual immunity win.

768
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:36,275
You know she's not going home.

769
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,034
What was the feeling today?

770
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:41,896
I think the dynamic
is changing a little bit.

771
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,758
I think people are
starting to think about

772
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:46,965
who they might want to sit
next to in the final three,

773
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,344
as opposed to who they want
to vote off next.

774
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:50,862
So it's different thinking.

775
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:53,379
It's a different feel,
and I think people are thinking

776
00:35:53,413 --> 00:35:55,551
more long-term
than short-term now.

777
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,724
Lindsay,
do you concur with that?

778
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:59,379
That maybe
the shift is happening?

779
00:35:59,413 --> 00:36:01,172
Absolutely. He's-- was spot-on.

780
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:02,620
Uh, like, at this point,

781
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:05,275
you're kind of figuring out
what are my best odds

782
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,034
to feel the most comfortable
in the final three.

783
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:11,275
So then, Omar, what does that do
in terms of who is the threat?

784
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,103
Who do I need to get out?

785
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,068
I don't know if I agree
with either of them,

786
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:16,241
to be honest.

787
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:18,206
I think people have been
playing for the long-term game

788
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:19,482
since the beginning.

789
00:36:19,517 --> 00:36:20,896
Some of the people there,

790
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:22,896
you know, they may have
been trustworthy allies,

791
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,103
but people didn't want
to go to the end with them.

792
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:26,310
And that's why they're there.

793
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:28,482
So I think
that that trend will continue.

794
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:29,827
It's just that
there's fewer people

795
00:36:29,862 --> 00:36:31,103
and less room to hide now.

796
00:36:31,137 --> 00:36:33,103
Maryanne,
where do you sit on that?

797
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,655
Is there a shift happening?

798
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:36,896
I feel as if it depends

799
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:39,448
on where your position
was in the tribe.

800
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:41,137
If you're someone
who's on the bottom,

801
00:36:41,172 --> 00:36:43,068
you might be thinking, "No, I
have to think self-preservation,

802
00:36:43,103 --> 00:36:45,482
self-preservation."
And when you finally feel

803
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:46,758
a little bit more wiggle room,
that's when you're like,

804
00:36:46,793 --> 00:36:49,000
"Okay, now I can think
about the endgame."

805
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:53,275
Lindsay, how confident are you
about tonight's vote?

806
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,241
I-I feel confident
in tonight's vote

807
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:56,655
with the discussions
that I've had.

808
00:36:56,689 --> 00:36:59,241
So it's really more so
if they feel equally

809
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:01,206
as confident
that I was being honest

810
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:02,689
with what my discussion was.

811
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:05,965
Mike, that's
a very honest answer

812
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,620
to actually say, "I'm good.

813
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:10,310
"I don't know if
the other people will trust me,

814
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,034
and if they don't,
it might not go my way."

815
00:37:12,068 --> 00:37:14,517
I-I live my life on trust.

816
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:17,482
I trust who I put my, uh,
fate in their hands

817
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:18,448
and their fate in my hands.

818
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:20,172
I trust in who I believe in.

819
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:23,103
Omar, what'd you read
into Lindsay's answer?

820
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:24,655
I mean,
I think that answer is...

821
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:25,896
just sums up
the game of <i>Survivor.</i>

822
00:37:25,931 --> 00:37:28,000
You never know if
what you say to other people

823
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:31,827
is gonna be taken with truth
or with a falsity.

824
00:37:31,862 --> 00:37:33,793
If I'm telling you something,
and you don't believe me,

825
00:37:33,827 --> 00:37:35,206
then you could
change everything up.

826
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:39,172
So I'm <i>Survivor</i> confident
in what's gonna happen tonight,

827
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:42,206
but every time you're <i>Survivor</i>
confident, you could be wrong.

828
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:43,172
So I'm open to that, too.

829
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,517
So, Jonathan, if you're right,

830
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:48,724
and the vote goes the way
you want it to go,

831
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:51,103
what impact will it have
when you guys get back to camp?

832
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:52,793
Like, if it works out,

833
00:37:52,827 --> 00:37:56,689
nobody lies, and everything
is all hunky-dory,

834
00:37:56,724 --> 00:37:58,896
then that'll be the first Tribal
where that's ever happened.

835
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:01,172
It's not that easy.

836
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:03,517
Something is happening where
somebody's being lied to.

837
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:06,275
There is gonna be people
that keep their trust,

838
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,517
and there are gonna be people
that lie.

839
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:10,724
Lindsay, do you agree with that?

840
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:11,931
I mean,
unless it's a clean sweep,

841
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:13,793
then, yeah, somebody else
will definitely be upset.

842
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:15,689
And usually, I don't think
there's been a clean sweep yet.

843
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:16,689
Mm-mm.

844
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:17,862
Not with the Shot in the Dark.

845
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,448
Why?

846
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:20,896
'Cause, like, you don't know
who's gonna play it.

847
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,206
This is the last time
we can play it.

848
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:25,068
And then, also,
there's idols in this game, too.

849
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,241
So then, after, if you're trying
to do a clean sweep, and then

850
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:29,758
that person who you're doing
a clean sweep for has an idol,

851
00:38:29,793 --> 00:38:31,931
then you're up the river, too,
'cause that person chooses.

852
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:33,448
You can never do
a clean sweep anymore.

853
00:38:33,482 --> 00:38:35,517
And, Omar, the tricky part
about that is,

854
00:38:35,551 --> 00:38:37,517
when there's only
six people voting anyway,

855
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:40,034
if you start splitting votes,
it gets very scary.

856
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:43,379
Yeah, and, I mean, there's
definitely the possibility

857
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:45,034
of a hidden immunity idol
coming out,

858
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:48,206
so we have to be really careful
if we don't have one.

859
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:49,896
I don't have one,

860
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:51,586
so I'm extra nervous
when you call out for

861
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,551
"Does anyone have
an advantage to play?"

862
00:38:53,586 --> 00:38:56,000
Because I could be on the
receiving end of a blindside.

863
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,413
All right, it is time to vote.

864
00:39:02,448 --> 00:39:03,655
Lindsay, you're up.

865
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:44,413
If anybody has
an advantage or an idol,

866
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,655
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

867
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:57,103
Okay, I'll read the votes.

868
00:40:02,103 --> 00:40:04,034
First vote.

869
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,517
Jonathan.

870
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:10,310
Romeo.

871
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:12,310
One vote Jonathan,
one vote Romeo.

872
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:15,448
Jonathan.
Two votes Jonathan,

873
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,103
one vote Romeo.

874
00:40:20,206 --> 00:40:21,344
Romeo. Tied again.

875
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:22,344
Two votes Jonathan,

876
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,241
two votes Romeo.

877
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,896
Omar.
That's two votes Jonathan,

878
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:32,000
two votes Romeo,
one vote Omar.

879
00:40:36,862 --> 00:40:38,206
Omar.

880
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:39,965
Two votes Jonathan,

881
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,482
two votes Romeo, two votes Omar.

882
00:40:42,517 --> 00:40:43,344
One vote left.

883
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:50,241
13th person voted out and
the sixth member of our jury...

884
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,448
Omar.

885
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:53,655
Wow. Good job.

886
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:55,517
I'm sorry.

887
00:40:55,551 --> 00:40:57,034
Good job, brother.

888
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,034
Good job. I love you, brother.

889
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:02,448
Sorry, Omar.
- Love you, buddy.

890
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,379
Good job. Good job.

891
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:09,482
That was wild.

892
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,413
Omar, the tribe has spoken.

893
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,551
Good job.

894
00:41:23,586 --> 00:41:24,965
- Love you, Omar.
- Bye, Omar.

895
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,758
Love you guys. See you soon.

896
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:34,965
Congratulations.

897
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,413
You've made it
to the final five,

898
00:41:37,448 --> 00:41:40,379
and you'll be starting
over again at a new camp.

899
00:41:40,413 --> 00:41:42,620
Grab your torches, head out.
Good night.

900
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:09,724
Next time, on the season finale
of</i> Survivor...

901
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:15,689
It's gonna be a battle royale.</i>

902
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:16,620
<i>
I ran around like a banshee.</i>

903
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:20,241
I made a fake idol. See?

904
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:22,724
...won't be here tomorrow.

905
00:42:22,758 --> 00:42:24,586
This challenge is on.

906
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,689
I'm fighting to the bitter end.

907
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:33,000
Maryanne got me.

908
00:42:33,034 --> 00:42:35,172
<i>She got me good.</i>

909
00:42:35,206 --> 00:42:38,034
<i>And I knew playing with her</i> <i>
was like playing with fire,</i>

910
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:40,310
<i>and I should have</i> <i>
listened to my gut.</i>

911
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:42,793
<i>But I was</i> Survivor <i>confident,</i>

912
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:45,137
<i>and that is the worst thing</i> <i>
you can be.</i>

913
00:42:45,172 --> 00:42:47,275
<i>But I still had a blast,</i>

914
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:50,793
and this was the best experience
of my life.
