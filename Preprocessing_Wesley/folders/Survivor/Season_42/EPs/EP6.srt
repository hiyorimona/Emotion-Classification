1
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:06,034
"You can agree
to secretly work together

2
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:08,586
<i>and each earn</i> <i>
an advantage in the process."</i>

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,275
<i>
I have to consider whether
or not I need to take them out,</i>

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,000
because this thing
becomes more powerful.

5
00:00:14,034 --> 00:00:17,827
"If both players choose to risk
their vote, then both players</i>

6
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:20,448
<i>lose their vote</i> <i>
at the next Tribal Council."</i>

7
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:23,241
Go for the gusto,
and risk the vote.

8
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,862
Did I just do it?
Did I just find an idol?

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,551
It's the classic case
of the bunny rabbit

10
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:34,241
having dinner at the mailbox.

11
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:35,896
This potato has skin.

12
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:37,241
We have skin.

13
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:39,275
Are we just all potatoes?

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,896
There's such grace in the game
of soccer that it makes me cry.

15
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,655
Now all three idols have power.</i>

16
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:47,931
I know that my head's
on the chopping block tonight.

17
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,482
I feel like my head is
also on the chopping block.

18
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>
Chanelle needs to go.</i> <i>
She did not have my back.</i>

19
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:55,034
So why should I trust her
going forward?

20
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:56,482
<i>
Daniel has one arm.</i>

21
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:57,482
He hasn't competed
in any challenges.

22
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:01,586
<i>
Chanelle or Daniel.</i>

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,137
<i>The merge is coming up</i> <i>
any day now,</i>

24
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:06,896
so tonight's Tribal Council
is monumental.

25
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:10,655
Daniel, the tribe has spoken.

26
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:11,862
The tribe has spoken.

27
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:20,965
<i>
What a vote.</i>

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,310
<i>I feel like that</i> <i>
was a pretty good blindside.</i>

29
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:25,793
Chanelle, you really fought
for your life.

30
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:27,275
I am so impressed.

31
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,482
Thank you.

32
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:31,655
Oh, my goodness.

33
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:33,379
The saga of Chanelle

34
00:01:33,413 --> 00:01:34,379
<i>versus Daniel.</i>

35
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:35,620
<i>Guess who came out on top.</i>

36
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:36,620
<i>I did.</i>

37
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:39,448
Just like I knew it.

38
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:40,517
Please.

39
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,689
Chanelle came for his neck.

40
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:45,689
Tribal was incredible,
but it was also very scary.

41
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:47,448
<i>You know,</i> <i>
I threw a vote Mike's way--</i>

42
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,000
<i>just in case Daniel</i> <i>
played a Shot in the Dark.</i>

43
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:51,551
I'm sorry that I had
to write your name down.

44
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:53,034
It was a game-time decision
where I...

45
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:54,103
I don't know what
the accomplishment was.

46
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:55,724
That's what I don't know.
Why my name?

47
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:57,206
Well, I was gonna tell you,
but you-you keep interrupting.

48
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,379
I just don't understand
the reason

49
00:01:58,413 --> 00:01:59,482
why you would
write my name down.

50
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:01,689
So I thought that, uh,

51
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:03,862
you and Dan were teaming up...

52
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:06,000
You think I believed Dan's snow job?
Wait, wait. No. Wait.

53
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:08,482
<i>
Chanelle put my name down</i> <i>
for no reason other than</i>

54
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:09,620
<i>to save her own hide.</i>

55
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:13,034
Expected? No. Surprise? No.

56
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:14,965
I gave you my word today.
I said, "I guarantee

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,793
you'll be here tonight,"
and you're here.

58
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:18,034
I told you that.
I thought, I thought you were playing

59
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:19,275
some Jedi mind tricks. No.

60
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,655
Let's-let's be unified...
We just, we...

61
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:22,517
I'm not mad.
It's gameplay. It's cool.

62
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:24,310
Yeah. We got...
Listen, we're together now. It's four of us.

63
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,517
Either we stick together or we're divided.
No, I know.

64
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:27,172
We're strong.
No hard feelings.

65
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:29,482
- It's all fair in love and <i>Survivor.</i>
- Yeah.

66
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,172
Come on. G-Give me a bro hug. Yeah.

67
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:33,620
- Bro hug!
- I love you.
- I love you.

68
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:36,103
- Vati four.
- I love you.

69
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:37,965
<i>
I act like no big deal,</i> <i>
it's gameplay.</i>

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,379
It's fine. No hard feelings.

71
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:41,137
<i>Which is not true.</i>

72
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:43,862
<i>I will never trust Chanelle</i> <i>
ever again.</i>

73
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,379
Please don't write
my name down again.

74
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:46,896
I-I won't.

75
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:48,000
<i>
Hai and Lydia</i>

76
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,034
I will take a bullet for.

77
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:51,862
<i>Unfortunately, Chanelle,</i> <i>
I will step to the side,</i>

78
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:53,172
<i>because that's what</i> <i>
she did to me tonight.</i>

79
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,206
Oh, my...

80
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,241
In the produce aisle today,
we have...

81
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:16,758
limes.

82
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:18,275
Do you need help?

83
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,586
No.
- Nice.

84
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,931
<i>Ever since I came back</i> <i>
from my journey,</i>

85
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:25,206
<i>every time I turn around,</i> <i>
there's Tori bothering me,</i>

86
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:28,103
trying to find out
what this journey entailed.

87
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:29,896
Did you have fun at all?

88
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:31,448
- A <i>Survivor</i> experience?
- I did not have fun.

89
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:33,034
It is not fun.

90
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:34,965
<i>
Rocksroy went to the summit,</i>

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,551
and he must have found some
type of a clue or something.

92
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:39,724
Seriously...

93
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:43,724
No, I believe, I believe you.
I believe you when you say that.

94
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:45,206
I'm saying, do you know
exactly what it was?

95
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:46,689
That's what I'm confused about.

96
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:47,965
Yeah, I know exactly
what it was.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,275
Oh, but you're
just not telling me?

98
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,793
I'm not telling anybody.
I didn't tell,

99
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:52,448
<i>I didn't tell Romeo</i> <i>
and I'm not telling Drea.</i>

100
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,862
<i>
Mm-hmm.</i>

101
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:56,068
<i>He won't give me</i> <i>
any information, and, like,</i>

102
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,793
<i>it doesn't make any sense</i> <i>
to me, and it's...</i>

103
00:03:57,827 --> 00:04:00,586
"Infuriating" is the best word
I could use to describe.

104
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,965
<i>Just so you know, I wouldn't
have thought you were disloyal,</i>

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,172
had you taken the advantage.

106
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:04,931
It's not a disloyalty.

107
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:06,172
- I don't know...
- But do you see how that's a little sketchy?

108
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,758
<i>It's clear he doesn't want</i> <i>
to work with me,</i>

109
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:11,344
so I'm done with him.

110
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:14,344
Can you just respect
the fact that what I did

111
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,793
- was in the tribe's benefit?
- Sure.

112
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,310
But you don't believe me.

113
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:20,068
I'm predictable,

114
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:21,655
<i>and it's good to have someone</i>

115
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:23,689
<i>that's predictable</i> <i>
a part of your alliance.</i>

116
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:25,448
<i>Tori is not predictable.</i>

117
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,310
She's not someone that I want
to take far in this game.

118
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:30,517
If you don't trust me
saying that to you...

119
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:32,241
I trust
what you're saying is real.

120
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,517
I just want to know
the other information.

121
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:36,344
So what do you think?
You think I have an advantage?

122
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,034
But you're
leaving something out.

123
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:40,413
<i>
It's never just, like,</i> <i>
calm with Tori.</i>

124
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,655
Tori can't just, like, chill.

125
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,758
Maybe I gave up something
so that all the four of us

126
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:47,000
- could move forward.
- Uh-huh.

127
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:48,137
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

128
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:49,241
I want to know what that is.

129
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:50,758
That sounds great.

130
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,275
But you keep asking,
and I'm not gonna tell.

131
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:01,241
<i>
She continues to do things</i> <i>
that start chaos in camp.</i>

132
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:06,482
That's a big con for me.
You know?

133
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:07,931
<i>I would just like</i> <i>
to get her out,</i>

134
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:10,103
<i>but she always somehow slips by.</i>

135
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:16,551
All right,
this is gonna be a fun day.

136
00:05:16,586 --> 00:05:18,310
So, back in <i>41,</i>

137
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:21,310
we did a historic merge twist
where one group

138
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:23,689
sent one player away,
not knowing

139
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:27,344
they would have the power to go
back in time and change history.

140
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:30,586
That player was Erika,
and she did seize the power,

141
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,137
and she changed history
and ended up winning the game.

142
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:36,344
But what's fun is, we shoot
our seasons back-to-back,

143
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,827
so the <i>S-42</i> players
have not seen season 41,

144
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:43,000
which gives us the opportunity
to do the same thing,

145
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:45,137
only tweak it a bit
to see if we can change

146
00:05:45,172 --> 00:05:47,137
their decision-making process.

147
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:49,379
So here are the three variables
we're gonna change.

148
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:51,931
First of all,
the food is from Applebee's.

149
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:54,034
That's big, that's emotional.

150
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:56,034
That's home.
That's hard to turn down.

151
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:58,137
Plus, we're gonna
tell them in advance

152
00:05:58,172 --> 00:06:00,551
that the player
they choose to send away

153
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:03,206
will have the power
to change the game.

154
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:04,586
That's huge power.

155
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,103
And then finally--
here they come--

156
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:08,310
the winning five will determine:

157
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:11,172
do they want to send somebody
away and give them that power,

158
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:14,034
or do one of the five want to
give up everything they just won

159
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:15,241
and keep that power?

160
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,586
It's designed to test

161
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,931
if anybody at this point
in the game will choose power

162
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,413
over the instant gratification
of food

163
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:25,931
and perceived safety
in the game.

164
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:28,000
What would you do?
Here we go.

165
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,275
Come on in.

166
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:38,275
Get your first look
at the new Vati tribe.

167
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:42,206
Daniel voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

168
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:44,068
Ooh.

169
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,517
All right,
shall we get to it?

170
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:46,586
Yeah.

171
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,551
You have entered
the next stage of the game...

172
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,241
...where tribes are no more

173
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,931
and the game has become individual.

174
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:58,034
Everybody drop your Buffs.

175
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,413
Oh, my God!

176
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:04,034
So, is this called the merge?

177
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:05,758
Not exactly.

178
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:09,724
In fact, you are not merged.

179
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:11,793
You will not be
officially merged

180
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:14,379
until after
the next Tribal Council.

181
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,965
Like everything else
in this game,

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,137
you are going to earn
your way into the merge.

183
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:23,827
Wow.
So right now, you are without a Buff,

184
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:26,206
and you are without a tribe.

185
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,517
What?
Let me explain how it's gonna work.

186
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,551
<i>We're gonna draw</i> <i>
for colored rocks</i>

187
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,137
<i>and divide into two teams.</i>

188
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:38,793
<i>On my go, you're gonna dig up</i> <i>
a massive boulder</i>

189
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:40,724
<i>and push it through</i> <i>
a series of obstacles,</i>

190
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:42,655
<i>collecting keys along the way.</i>

191
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:46,379
<i>When you get to the end, you'll
climb to the top of the tower</i>

192
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:49,965
<i>and use those keys to unlock</i> <i>
a 75-piece</i> Survivor <i>puzzle.</i>

193
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:57,448
First team to finish
earns their Buff.

194
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:59,103
Wow. Oh, it's purple!
- The merge Buff.

195
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,034
You will also earn immunity

196
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:05,275
at the first Tribal Council,

197
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,862
which means
you don't have to compete

198
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:08,896
in that first
individual immunity challenge.

199
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:10,551
You're safe.
Oh, my gosh...

200
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:13,620
You'll still vote,
but you can't be voted out.

201
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:17,172
You will also earn the biggest
food reward of the season.

202
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,551
Come on, baby. Come on.
Want to know what you're playing for?

203
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:19,965
- Yeah.
- Yes.

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,793
It's good. It's big.
It's Applebee's.

205
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:25,689
Oh, my God!

206
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,862
I love Applebee's.

207
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:32,034
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, my God!

208
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,551
We'll start
with some appetizers.

209
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:36,517
- No.
- Crunchy Onion Rings...

210
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:38,103
with honey barbecue sauce.

211
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:39,448
Oh...

212
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:41,793
- Double Crunch Bone-
- In Wings.

213
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:43,965
Crispy on the outside,
tender on the inside.

214
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,379
Wings.

215
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:46,896
And do you want burgers?

216
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:47,862
You'll have
your choice of three burgers.

217
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:49,344
I'm a burger kind of guy.

218
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,379
Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, my God.

219
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,379
You got the quesadilla burger.
Come on.

220
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:56,689
You got the whiskey bacon burger. Yes.

221
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:58,344
Or you got
the classic bacon burger.

222
00:08:58,379 --> 00:08:59,344
Oh, my God.

223
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,586
For dessert...

224
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,586
- Dessert?
- Hell yeah, dessert.

225
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,034
The Applebee's brownie.

226
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,793
Oh, I love brownies.

227
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:09,103
Oh, my gosh.
And the specialty drink is the Shark Bowl.

228
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:10,206
Yeah.
- Oh, baby.

229
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,724
Worth playing for?
- Yeah!

230
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:12,689
Hell yeah!

231
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:15,068
Losers, no Buff,

232
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:17,103
no immunity, no food.

233
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:18,206
Holy crap. Wow. Aw.

234
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,965
And you will have to compete

235
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,241
in that first
individual immunity challenge

236
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,931
for safety
at the first Tribal Council.

237
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,103
There is one more twist.

238
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:27,275
Obviously.
- Oh, God.

239
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,103
Two of you will
draw gray-colored rocks.

240
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,034
No.
You will not compete.

241
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:36,344
Your fate will be decided
by the winning five.

242
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:40,241
Shall we draw for our teams?
- Yes.

243
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:47,379
With every hand that goes in
this bag, the game is changing.

244
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:52,103
Nothing is free
in the new era of <i>Survivor.</i>

245
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:54,827
All right.

246
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:57,724
Everybody, let's reveal.

247
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,724
All right.

248
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:14,103
Everybody, let's reveal.

249
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,793
Oh, no.

250
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,689
If you are blue, head to blue.

251
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:24,586
If you are orange,
head to orange.

252
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,241
If you have gray,
you're in the middle.

253
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,275
You are not competing.

254
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,172
Let's see our teams of five.

255
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:36,551
All right, let's look
at what we have.

256
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:39,034
For orange,
it's gonna be Lydia,

257
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:42,413
Jonathan, Maryanne,
Hai and Tori.

258
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:46,206
Running for blue,
Drea, Mike, Romeo, Omar

259
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:48,206
and Chanelle.

260
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,758
And the two people
who drew gray--

261
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:52,551
Lindsay and Rocksroy--
you will not compete.

262
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,965
Your fate in this game

263
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,620
will be determined
by the winning five.

264
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,620
All right, you two are gonna
take a spot on the bench.

265
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,448
Everybody else, give you
a minute to strategize,

266
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:03,379
and we will get on
to the biggest challenge

267
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,172
- of <i>Survivor 42.</i> Here we go.
- Yeah.

268
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:07,379
Let's do it.

269
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:16,034
All right, here we go.

270
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,965
Biggest stakes of the season.

271
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Survivors ready.

272
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:23,551
Go!

273
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:25,034
Go.

274
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:28,034
First, you got to dig up
a massive boulder.

275
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:30,068
And I mean massive.

276
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:34,206
Good.

277
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:35,482
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:40,482
12 days into <i>Survivor 42,</i>

279
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:42,482
it's gonna take
everything you have

280
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:44,448
at this point in the game.

281
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:47,172
This boulder is heavy,
and it is deep in the sand.

282
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:51,034
Jonathan gonna see
if they can get it out.

283
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:53,620
This would be a very fast move.

284
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,137
Jonathan putting
his shoulder into it.

285
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,620
Got a little bit of nudge,
but not enough.

286
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:00,586
Let's all try pushing together, guys.
- Okay.

287
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,827
Let's all try pushing together.
- Okay.

288
00:12:03,068 --> 00:12:05,068
One, two...
Orange gonna give it a go again.

289
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:06,068
They've been moving fast.

290
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:08,034
And they've got momentum.

291
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,034
Can they get it out?

292
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:11,724
Yeah!

293
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:14,034
Big early lead by orange!
Push fast. Push fast.

294
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,275
Now blue feels
momentum shifting.

295
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,448
Jonathan is leading his tribe.

296
00:12:18,482 --> 00:12:20,275
Got to slow that ball down now.

297
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,103
Orange, over here.

298
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,551
Go, go. Go.

299
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,344
Blue is now getting it
out of the sand.

300
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,862
Everybody putting their shoulder into it.
Go! Go!

301
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:30,551
That's how you do it
on <i>Survivor!</i>

302
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,724
You're in this.

303
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:35,275
More, more, more, more.
It is Tori up for orange,

304
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,413
trying to untie that key.

305
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:40,689
Blue trying to get
over that obstacle.

306
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:43,689
Up over the top.
Back it up, back it up. Back it up.

307
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:44,551
She's got it.

308
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:47,896
Tori's down.

309
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:50,034
Slides on the butt.
That'll leave a mark.

310
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,034
One, two, three.

311
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,586
Here comes blue now.

312
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,068
Jonathan pushing
that ball again.

313
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,517
I-I am, too.

314
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,103
Mm-hmm.

315
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:05,655
One, two...

316
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:07,034
Push.
Three.

317
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:07,896
Big push by orange!

318
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:13,103
Jonathan single-handedly
almost pushed that ball over.

319
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,655
Blue trying to stay in it.

320
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:19,724
Gonna be Romeo
trying to find the key.

321
00:13:23,655 --> 00:13:25,620
Orange working
together very well.

322
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:29,344
Now you got to slow
that ball back down

323
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,551
and bring it back. But orange with a nice lead.
Good!

324
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:33,620
Something Jonathan
has been used to.

325
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:36,413
We're not.
Romeo still

326
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,068
working on the key for blue.

327
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:39,241
Get ready, get ready.
This is it.

328
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:40,275
Come on down.

329
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:43,275
Blue's back on the move!

330
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,793
Coming down.

331
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,793
Tori quickly gets down.
Orange out of the way.

332
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,413
Now you put it in its holder.

333
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:56,206
Jonathan, he's the ladder.

334
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:58,206
Lifts Tori.

335
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:00,413
Ready?

336
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,517
Blue moving again.

337
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,620
No...

338
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:07,448
One by one, Jonathan
is getting everybody up.

339
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:13,137
Jonathan, watch out behind you.

340
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:15,413
Jonathan is up.

341
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:17,413
An amazing move by Jonathan.

342
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:18,793
- Wow.
- And you're good.

343
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,241
Start the human ladder.

344
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:23,310
Jonathan scampers to the top.

345
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:25,758
Another unbelievable display.

346
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:27,482
Jonathan gets Tori up.

347
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:29,241
Hai using his back.

348
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:32,103
There goes Maryanne. Jonathan
gonna just yank Maryanne up.

349
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:35,172
Here comes Lydia. She's up.

350
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:36,413
Let's go.

351
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:38,137
Hai gonna give it a running go.

352
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:39,517
Let's go.

353
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:43,758
Hai, he's got it.

354
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:45,137
You're good.
Two people on the puzzle.

355
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:47,275
Let's go, mamas.
Great job by orange.

356
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,482
Hold it, hold it.

357
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:52,137
You got it.

358
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:52,862
Get it, get it, Mike.
Get it, get it.

359
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:54,344
Romeo has the key.

360
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:56,448
Now you got to get down
and seat your ball right here.

361
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,310
Straight ahead.
Push, right, straight ahead.

362
00:14:58,344 --> 00:14:59,620
Gonna be Maryanne and Lydia

363
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:02,310
on the puzzle for orange.
It is a big puzzle.

364
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:03,827
Seventy-five pieces.

365
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,379
You got time, but you got
to keep moving.

366
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,344
Up here.

367
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:10,448
Mike gonna be first up on blue.

368
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:14,068
Scraping that body
against the ball.

369
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:15,758
- It's right here.
- Oh, nice.

370
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:18,206
Maryanne and Lydia have
a big advantage right now,

371
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:19,586
but that is a big puzzle.

372
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,310
Good job, girls.

373
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:24,034
Mike bringing those
firefighter days into play.

374
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:25,862
Lift off. You go.

375
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:27,344
One human after another.
Let's go.

376
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,068
Mike pulling up Chanelle now.

377
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:31,068
Drea, a workhorse down there.
Great job, Drea.

378
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:32,793
Now Drea's got to get up.

379
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:36,137
Ah!

380
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:38,034
That is not easy to do.

381
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:39,482
You got this, Drea. You got this.
You can do it.

382
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:41,034
You got this. You got this.

383
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,000
Drea, you got it.
One more time, Drea.

384
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:45,758
Let's go. It's time to eat...
Here goes Drea, again.

385
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:50,068
Drea is literally scraping
her body against the ball

386
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:51,965
and goes down again.

387
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:56,517
This is effort on Day 12, <i>Survivor 42.</i> Here.

388
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:58,379
Pull my feet. By the feet.

390
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,655
Mike, let's-- Okay.

391
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:03,310
Drea out of gas.

392
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:05,448
Beating up her body.

393
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:07,793
Good job, girls.

394
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:09,241
Lydia and Maryanne continue

395
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,448
to work side by side.

396
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:11,965
They've got
a big-time advantage,

397
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,724
and they're
working very well together.

398
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:15,137
Yes.
Nice.

399
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,586
Drea trying to get some wind.

400
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,724
12 days into <i>Survivor</i> makes this very, very tough. Drea.

401
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:24,137
Drea literally gonna grab on
to the feet of Mike,

402
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:26,724
who's being held on to
by Omar and Chanelle,

403
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:28,758
who's being held on to by Romeo.

404
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:30,965
Drea gets kicked in the face.
You okay?

405
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:34,827
One more time, Drea.

406
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,172
Don't worry, Drea.
It's a huge puzzle.

407
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,827
All right, Romeo...

408
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,275
They're gonna change
their strategy.

409
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,965
Romeo gonna have to go back down now.
Where's Romeo?

410
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,413
Go down. Climb down on me.

411
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:50,655
Mike with a good idea,
which is to help Drea get up.

412
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,137
Maryanne,
while she's working on that,

413
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:55,482
why don't you flip the pieces
so you can see all of 'em?

414
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,413
No, that's all good.
We have time.

415
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:01,551
Use my body. Use my body.

416
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,000
Drea on Romeo's back.

417
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:05,034
Yes, Drea!

418
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:08,448
Climb, girl.
Everything in you, Drea.

419
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:10,620
Yes!
Drea now on Mike's back.

420
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,310
Drea's up.
Romeo now trying to get up.

421
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:15,551
Romeo's up. The strategy worked.

422
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:17,793
Blue is good.
Now Mike's the last one.

423
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:20,931
- I got it. I'm up. I'm up.
- Now you got another ladder you got to build.

424
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:22,827
Right here.
You know you can do this.

425
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:24,827
I know.

426
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:27,793
Mike climbs on Omar.
Mike is up.

427
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,034
There you go. There you go.

428
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:30,241
You got it, Drea. Pull.

429
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:31,758
Drea's up.
Come here. I got you.

430
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:34,068
Lydia and Maryanne
still working on the puzzle.

431
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,862
They've got a long way to go. Good.

432
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:39,482
Now, can Omar get up there?
Here we go.

433
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,931
Omar has Mike.

434
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:42,103
Can he pull him up?

435
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:43,965
That's how you dig,
right there!

436
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:47,689
All right, we're good. Go.

437
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,448
It is Chanelle and Omar
working quickly now.

438
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:56,275
It took them a long time to
get up here, but they're here.

439
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,827
Let's go, Chanelle.
Let's go, Omar.

440
00:17:59,931 --> 00:18:02,896
Lydia and Maryanne continue
to work side by side.

441
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,655
Piece by piece. Yeah.

442
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:05,965
Y'all are doing amazing,
but don't get comfortable.

443
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,344
Yeah.

444
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,827
Thank you for the reminder.
It really means a lot.

445
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:13,655
Lindsay and Rocksroy
down below,

446
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,655
no idea what
is happening up here.

447
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:17,724
Their fate will be in the hands
of the winning five.

448
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:22,793
Piece by piece,

449
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:25,862
orange getting closer and closer

450
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,000
to winning the biggest reward
of the season.

451
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:31,689
Nice. Nice.
Tribe Buff, immunity at the first Tribal Council,

452
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,448
and Applebee's on the line.

453
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:35,034
Nice.

454
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:36,965
Shark Bowl, the brownie,
the burgers,

455
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,068
the fixings, the fries.

456
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,103
Chanelle, Omar struggling
to get back into this,

457
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:45,724
but it won't matter.

458
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,034
This one is over now.

459
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:49,517
It's just a matter
of these last few pieces.

460
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:51,344
Tori, Jonathan,

461
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:54,551
Hai, Lydia, Maryanne,
for the win.

462
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:56,482
And they've got it.

463
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,137
Biggest reward of the season.

464
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:01,068
And this challenge is over.

465
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:03,344
Wow.

466
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:05,758
Mwah.

467
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:17,689
The biggest challenge
of the season.

468
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,965
Everybody put in
a ton of effort,

469
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,172
but the victory went to

470
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:26,758
Maryanne, Jonathan,
Tori, Hai and Lydia.

471
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,275
So here's what you just earned:

472
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,413
your Buffs, immunity
at that first Tribal Council--

473
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:33,413
which means
you don't have to compete

474
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:35,793
in that first
individual immunity challenge--

475
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:37,551
plus Applebee's.

476
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:39,517
A very nice afternoon.

477
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:41,689
Here's a big decision you have
to make before you leave,

478
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:43,034
as a group.

479
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:45,551
Lindsay and Rocksroy,

480
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:46,862
you're gonna determine
their fate.

481
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:48,689
One of them is gonna join you.

482
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:51,896
- Oh, wow.
- And for them, it is as though they won.

483
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,931
They get the Buff,
they get the immunity,

484
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:55,448
they get the food.

485
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:57,551
The other will be sent away

486
00:19:57,586 --> 00:20:01,586
to another island and exiled
for two days and two nights,

487
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,068
where they will live alone
with no Buff, no immunity,

488
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:07,551
no food, no shelter,
no company, nothing.

489
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:10,517
And to complicate your decision
a little more,

490
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,862
the person you send away

491
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:15,896
will have the power
to change the game.

492
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:19,275
So the question
you have to decide,

493
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,965
do you want to send one
of these two away,

494
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,931
knowing they will be
in control of the power,

495
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:26,793
or do one of the five of you
want to give up everything

496
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:30,241
you just earned to be sure
you're in charge of the power?

497
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:32,034
You have two
big decisions to make.

498
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,896
Who do you bring
with you and who goes?

499
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:40,586
Both Lindsay and
Rocksroy will have their game

500
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,931
altered dramatically
by the decision that is made.

501
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:47,517
Walk me through
the thought process

502
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:49,241
about who you want
to bring with you, Hai,

503
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:51,862
because it's a very big
strategic decision

504
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:54,379
to give this gift to a player.

505
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:55,655
Jeff, it was simple.

506
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:58,344
One of them looks like
they really need to eat.

507
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:01,206
That was our reasoning
for the decision today.

508
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:03,034
I'm sorry, Rocksroy,
but we're bringing Lindsay.

509
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:05,931
I'm so sorry.

510
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,689
Yeah.

511
00:21:08,724 --> 00:21:12,172
Lindsay joins the five
that now becomes six.

512
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:15,620
Now, the next
equally big question.

513
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:16,724
You gonna send him away,

514
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:17,896
or are one of you
gonna take the spot?

515
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:21,448
We're sending him.

516
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:26,275
Okay. Rocksroy, you're gonna
be taken to another island

517
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,241
where you will
live alone for two days,

518
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:29,517
two nights.
You got it, Rocks.

519
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:32,344
For the winning six,
there are your Buffs.

520
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:35,068
Head out for a nice
afternoon of Applebee's.

521
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:36,724
Congrats, guys. Congrats.

522
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,689
Chanelle, Mike, Romeo,
Omar, Drea.

523
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:46,620
Normally,
I'd say I got nothing for you,

524
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,931
but after that effort, there
is a small consolation prize--

525
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:52,034
one serving of rice.

526
00:21:52,068 --> 00:21:54,172
And you'll be heading
to the Vati beach.

527
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:55,931
That is gonna be
where everybody lives.

528
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,517
Grab your stuff, head out.

529
00:21:57,551 --> 00:21:59,793
Get used to your new home,
and enjoy your rice.

530
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,448
Come on, guys.

531
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:09,689
So, Rocksroy, what's the feeling

532
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:12,310
when they had a choice
between you and Lindsay,

533
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,172
but they still sent you away?

534
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:16,482
Actually, I was
hoping it was Lindsay to go

535
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:18,724
when you said that the person
that's coming back

536
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:21,103
would have a little bit more
of an advantage in this game.

537
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:24,931
Yep, if there is a silver
lining, Rocksroy, it is that.

538
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:27,034
You will have power
to change the game.

539
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:29,413
And that's gonna be the question
as you sit out there.

540
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,862
What is the power,
and what will you do with it?

541
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:35,137
Everything
will be revealed in time.

542
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:36,862
For now, you got to head out.
Boat will pick you up,

543
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:37,931
take you to your new home.

544
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,068
See you soon, Jeff.

545
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:41,379
Good luck.
- All right, buddy.

546
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:44,379
<i>They said they took Lindsay</i> <i>
because she needed food.</i>

547
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:46,724
Uh, no, we all need food.

548
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:48,034
We're all hungry.

549
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,965
<i>So I'm not sure</i> <i>
what the reasoning is.</i>

550
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,931
<i>Maybe Tori sent me out here</i> <i>
to weaken me even more.</i>

551
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:55,034
<i>But I'm not</i> <i>
disappointed about it</i>

552
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:56,448
<i>because in</i> Survivor

553
00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:58,172
this is what you want.

554
00:22:58,206 --> 00:22:59,862
You want it to be hard,

555
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:01,793
because it shouldn't be so easy
just to get a million dollars.

556
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:14,310
Applebee's,
Applebee's, Applebee's.

557
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:15,758
French fries!
Applebee's!

558
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:17,000
French fries!
French fries!

559
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:19,137
Oh, my God.

560
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:21,344
The Applebee's was so sweet.

561
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, my gosh.

562
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,586
<i>They bring out burgers,</i> <i>
and, oh, it was so good.</i>

563
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,620
I'm gonna need to get one of
these again when I go home.

564
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:29,482
I wanted this one so bad.

565
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:31,137
So bad.

566
00:23:31,172 --> 00:23:32,517
I haven't been
this happy in 12 days.

567
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:35,482
Even sweeter than the food,

568
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:38,103
<i>the six of us got our Buffs,</i>

569
00:23:38,137 --> 00:23:40,000
<i>and that automatically means</i> <i>
we're safe</i>

570
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:41,172
<i>in that first Tribal,</i> <i>
which is huge.</i>

571
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:42,620
<i>It was a win like no other.</i>

572
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,103
Oh, my God.
This was huge.

573
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:47,620
Rocksroy has a huge power,

574
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:49,000
which is very ambiguous.

575
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:53,137
Yeah, he did.
Like a whole lot.

576
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:55,448
- He, like, he was, like, warning us almost, like, "Are you sure?"
- Mm-hmm.

577
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:57,137
<i>I almost went to Exile,</i>

578
00:23:57,172 --> 00:24:00,482
because of this great power
that Jeff was talking about.

579
00:24:00,517 --> 00:24:04,344
- Oh, my gosh. <i>
- But I'm twice as big</i>

580
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:05,827
<i>as everybody out here.</i>

581
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,241
And 12 days of not eating,

582
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:08,310
<i>I'm starving.</i>

583
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:10,241
<i>So today</i> <i>
I'm eating like a king.</i>

584
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:17,758
Those wings are to die for.

585
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:19,482
They're perfect.

586
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:22,655
<i>Back home,</i> <i>
my average meal is 18 eggs,</i>

587
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:24,482
<i>nine pieces of cheese and grits.</i>

588
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:26,896
So I was in heaven.

589
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:29,137
<i>I ate as much</i> <i>
as I possibly could.</i>

590
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:30,758
Come on, man. Talk to me.

591
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:34,827
<i>
But I'm a bigger guy,</i>

592
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:36,206
<i>and I'm worried about that,</i>

593
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,034
<i>because that's</i> <i>
already a target on my back.</i>

594
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:39,931
So I have got to lay low
as much as I can...

595
00:24:41,206 --> 00:24:43,689
<i>...and hope that</i> <i>
my social game is enough</i>

596
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:44,862
<i>to keep me around.</i>

597
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,655
You're gonna love it.

598
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:47,586
Oh, my God.

599
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,896
Oh...

600
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:52,034
How am I gonna finish that?

601
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:53,827
Dude...

602
00:24:53,862 --> 00:24:55,379
Oh, my God.

603
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:56,758
<i>I feel like</i> <i>
I went from zero to hero.</i>

604
00:24:56,793 --> 00:24:59,034
<i>Like, not only</i> <i>
did we win Applebee's,</i>

605
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:00,793
<i>I'm the only person from Ika.</i>

606
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:01,965
And not only that,

607
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,551
Rocksroy was the one
who was outcasted.

608
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,827
Like, it just, it couldn't
have been more perfect.

609
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:08,551
I was like the one person
on my tribe Rocksroy

610
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:10,724
would not have wanted
in the position of, like,

611
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:12,758
making the decision
if he went or not.

612
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:14,137
Yeah.
- I don't know.

613
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:15,724
Uh, you two
don't really get along?

614
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:17,137
No, it's very rare that
I don't get along with someone.

615
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:19,310
Oh, also he voted for me last
Tribal Council, as well. Yeah.

616
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:20,758
- Oh.
- They also, yeah,

617
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:22,241
tried to get me out
last Tribal Council, as well.

618
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:24,000
<i>I am letting</i> <i>
all the secrets out.</i>

619
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:27,379
I'm airing all my tribe's
dirty laundry. I don't care,

620
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:29,068
<i>because my old Ika tribe</i> <i>
didn't want to work with me.</i>

621
00:25:29,103 --> 00:25:30,724
So we just don't get along.

622
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:32,793
So I didn't really want him here
because I wanted to enjoy this.

623
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:34,896
Yeah.
- I'm trying to make myself known as, like,

624
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:38,310
"Hey, you want a number? Like,
me, right here. Work with me."

625
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:42,310
And Rocksroy, he only cares
about the shelter and the fire.

626
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:44,413
So honestly, he's probably
loving being by himself.

627
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,206
<i>
I've been waiting</i>

628
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:47,896
<i>for the individual part.</i>

629
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:50,000
<i>And it was so scary, because</i> <i>
I almost didn't get here.</i>

630
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:51,586
<i>But now that I'm here,</i>

631
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,241
I'm gonna do what I want to do
with other people, not Ika.

632
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:56,827
Cheers to us, y'all.
Cheers.

633
00:25:56,862 --> 00:25:58,000
We'll always have Applebee's.

634
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:10,275
Literally, everything
that they're having today

635
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,517
was literally
what I was dreaming about.

636
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,172
Really?
- What to expect this season.

637
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,482
Usually people will just get
to the merge and celebrate.

638
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:19,172
We have to freakin' earn it.
Do you guys think we're gonna have a merge feast?

639
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:21,655
No.
The rice we're gonna have is gonna be our merge feast.

640
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:24,896
Man, losing that challenge
hurt on a visceral level.

641
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:27,724
<i>Like, I'm absolutely starving,
but I didn't come here to eat,</i>

642
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:29,448
<i>I came here to play and to win.</i>

643
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:32,482
And so not having immunity
is probably the hardest part,

644
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:34,620
<i>because the chances of me</i> <i>
going out just got higher.</i>

645
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:36,655
<i>It really sucks.</i>

646
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:38,482
Do you want me to pour
the rest of the rice in, or no?

647
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:39,758
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- All right.

648
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:42,482
Uh-oh...

649
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,137
<i>
We got a little bag of rice.</i>

650
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:45,655
<i>It could have been a bag</i>

651
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:49,275
of cockroaches
or pieces of doo-doo,

652
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,551
and we would have been celebrating.

653
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:51,793
That looks amazing.

654
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,482
<i>
We have been starving.</i>

655
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:55,172
<i>I'm starting</i> <i>
to look like a skeleton.</i>

656
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:58,448
So, sorry, America,
I look like crap.

657
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:01,379
I can't wait to know
what Rocksroy comes back with.

658
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,103
And he actually said to them,
"Are you sure you want to s...?"

659
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:04,206
He kept on saying that.

660
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:06,344
You never know,
he might come back

661
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:08,068
and be able to say that
he can switch it to where

662
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:10,034
- they are not immune and we are.
- Ooh.

663
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:11,275
That's why he was like,

664
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,068
"You sure one of you guys
don't want to go?"

665
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:16,068
- That would be amazing.
- That would be amazing.

666
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:19,379
<i>Fortunately, Rocksroy's</i> <i>
a part of my alliance,</i>

667
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:21,379
and if there's any way
he can change the game,

668
00:27:21,413 --> 00:27:22,965
it would be
in my benefit as well.

669
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,379
<i>However, I can't rely on that.</i>

670
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:27,034
Did you guys
put clothes out there?

671
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:28,137
Where?
I put socks.
Oh, I did.

672
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:36,068
<i>
I know Mike has an idol,
because we both said the phrase</i>

673
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:38,172
at the previous
immunity challenge.

674
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:41,137
<i>So I'm hoping that Mike</i> <i>
wants to work with me.</i>

675
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,793
Maybe.

676
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:53,620
I think that...

677
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:56,862
I mean two...

678
00:27:56,896 --> 00:27:57,896
- Um...
- I'm with...

679
00:27:57,931 --> 00:28:00,034
I'm with Romeo and Rocks.

680
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:03,034
All right, good.
Hai and Lydia are my alliance.

681
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,310
- Cool.
- Okay.

682
00:28:04,344 --> 00:28:06,034
The one person on our team,
I'm just gonna tell you that...

683
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,517
- I won't say a word.
- Tori.

684
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:09,655
She literally tells
everyone's business on our team.

685
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:14,862
So...

686
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:17,862
But, uh...

687
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,689
Yeah. <i>
Drea's a smart player.</i>

688
00:28:21,724 --> 00:28:22,689
<i>She knows where she's at,</i>

689
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:24,310
<i>and we both have the idol.</i>

690
00:28:24,344 --> 00:28:25,655
That was our bond.

691
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:27,517
We both feel

692
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:28,379
<i>that we could protect</i> <i>
each other.</i>

693
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,206
<i>Am I feeling safe?</i>

694
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:36,551
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

695
00:28:36,586 --> 00:28:38,379
<i>The war is about to begin,</i>

696
00:28:38,413 --> 00:28:40,896
and I'm not going home
with an idol in my pocket.

697
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:54,586
Holy cow.

698
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:56,827
Oh, boy.

699
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,379
Well, I got a pot.

700
00:28:58,413 --> 00:28:59,551
I got a machete.

701
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:02,137
Oh, what is this?

702
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:03,724
Some rice.

703
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:05,655
Jeff, thank you.

704
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:07,103
Let's get set up.

705
00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:08,551
I'll start with fire.

706
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,000
Damn it.

707
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:17,413
This is killing me that
I can't get this started.

708
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:19,068
<i>I started with my fire.</i>

709
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:21,448
<i>Massive failure</i> <i>
on the first strike.</i>

710
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:23,862
<i>Massive failure</i> <i>
on the 50th strike.</i>

711
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:26,103
Come on.

712
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:27,931
<i>But I always tell my kids,</i>

713
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:29,586
<i>"Do it, get it done,</i> <i>
get it out of the way."</i>

714
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,586
<i>Don't rely</i>

715
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,862
on someone else to do it.

716
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:32,724
Well, at this situation,

717
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:34,137
I can't rely
on anyone else to do it.

718
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,275
I got to do it.

719
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,275
<i>Let's get this done.</i>

720
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,551
Let's go.

721
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:38,655
You can do this.

722
00:29:41,103 --> 00:29:42,931
Rock and roll.

723
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:46,620
<i>I tell myself all the time,</i> <i>
try it.</i>

724
00:29:46,655 --> 00:29:48,206
<i>If you fail...</i>

725
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:50,965
...do it again.

726
00:29:53,034 --> 00:29:54,586
Ooh, I've got something.

727
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,827
What is this?

728
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,068
Looks like some type of hammer.

729
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:00,482
Uh-oh.

730
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:03,758
I guess this may be
part of what my advantage is.

731
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:05,275
No information at all.

732
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,620
I'm gonna take it up to camp,

733
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:09,068
set it aside,

734
00:30:09,103 --> 00:30:11,448
until I know exactly what
I need to do with this.

735
00:30:11,482 --> 00:30:15,137
<i>Jeff said I will have the power</i> <i>
to change the game.</i>

736
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:17,655
<i>So I'm not sure</i> <i>
what that means yet.</i>

737
00:30:17,689 --> 00:30:19,379
And now I'm here,

738
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:21,482
and I'm in this situation
where I have to earn it.

739
00:30:21,517 --> 00:30:23,896
<i>I'm dealt this card,</i> <i>
and I'm gonna deal with it.</i>

740
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:26,137
There's a rule in firewood.

741
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:28,862
You think you have enough,
double it.

742
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:33,068
See? You got
a little point on it.

743
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:35,137
And then you can do this.

744
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:37,275
Let's do a twist.

745
00:30:38,482 --> 00:30:39,310
There we go.

746
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:42,655
See? That's why you test it.

747
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:44,655
Oh, yeah.

748
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:47,034
Organic cordage. Nice.

749
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:48,931
Nice.

750
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:51,793
<i>Being out here by myself</i> <i>
with no kids around,</i>

751
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:54,724
<i>no wife that's bored</i> <i>
and wants to nag me,</i>

752
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:56,310
<i>I saw it as an opportunity.</i>

753
00:30:56,344 --> 00:30:58,482
<i>I'm getting to do</i> <i>
some things out here</i>

754
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:00,517
<i>that I've always wanted to do</i>

755
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:02,310
<i>and also learn new things</i> <i>
about myself.</i>

756
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:03,310
Oh, yeah.

757
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:04,379
<i>And that to me is wonderful.</i>

758
00:31:04,413 --> 00:31:07,000
Not to mention,
I'm in Fiji, man.

759
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:09,965
Oh.

760
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,655
Holy moly.

761
00:31:11,689 --> 00:31:15,206
Jiminy Crickets, that's amazing.

762
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,827
Ah, this is truly beautiful.

763
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:19,655
Wow, I'm so lucky
to be here right now.

764
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:21,310
Wow, man.

765
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,655
<i>I'm trying</i> <i>
to soak everything in,</i>

766
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:24,862
<i>take a mental picture of this,</i>

767
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:28,137
<i>because one of my biggest</i> <i>
challenges is just my vision.</i>

768
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:30,137
<i>I have, uh, keratoconus,</i>

769
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:32,551
<i>which is the coning</i> <i>
of your cornea.</i>

770
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:35,275
<i>I've had to have surgery</i> <i>
on both of my eyes for it,</i>

771
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,965
<i>and it could lead to blindness.</i>

772
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,034
So this may be the last time,
at my age, that I'm able

773
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:42,965
<i>to just see how beautiful</i> <i>
our planet is.</i>

774
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,310
<i>I mean, it's-it's-it's...</i> <i>
it's-it's emotional.</i>

775
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:46,862
Wow.

776
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:49,103
Full moon off the horizon.

777
00:31:49,137 --> 00:31:51,379
I was definitely meant
to be here.

778
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:53,482
<i>Almost like</i> <i>
I'm getting a reward,</i>

779
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:55,827
<i>even though this</i> <i>
is not a reward, by the way,</i>

780
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:57,448
by no stretch of the mindset.
This is not.

781
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,034
This is, this is work.

782
00:31:59,068 --> 00:32:02,068
But it feels as if I'm getting
a little bit of reward because

783
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:05,068
<i>of the beauty and how incredible</i> <i>
the Fijian islands are.</i>

784
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,724
I think I'm just blessed
to be here.

785
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:10,551
It's just amazing.

786
00:32:10,586 --> 00:32:13,344
I feel like
the luckiest person right now.

787
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:16,448
It's funny, I'm laughing
and crying at the same time,

788
00:32:16,482 --> 00:32:18,586
but I feel like
the luckiest person.

789
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,482
It's crazy.

790
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,758
I was meant to be right here,
'cause I'm blessed to be.

791
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:28,068
Man.

792
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:43,758
They're back. Hey.

793
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:46,206
New faces.

794
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:48,241
- Nice to meet you, Hai.
- Pleasure, Omar.

795
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:49,758
Omar. Nice to meet you.

796
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,448
Nice to meet you.

797
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,344
<i>
This is truly where</i> <i>
the party starts,</i>

798
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:00,620
<i>where the war begins.</i> <i>
From the outside,</i>

799
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:02,793
<i>you would think</i> <i>
that within this group of 12,</i>

800
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:05,034
there would be four Vati people
sticking together,

801
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,689
four Ika people
sticking together,

802
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:08,413
and four Taku people
sticking together.

803
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:10,758
<i>But at this point,</i> <i>
I'm one of the only people</i>

804
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:14,000
<i>that are vulnerable, so I'm not</i> <i>
closing any doors right now.</i>

805
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,517
<i>But make no mistake about it,</i>

806
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:19,000
I will jump up
like a big shark from the ocean

807
00:33:19,034 --> 00:33:21,413
and eat some of these people up
when the time is right.

808
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:24,103
I would like to think
we all made it to merge.

809
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:25,448
We did.
- I'm not sure yet. I'm not sure.

810
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:28,827
I'm not there.

811
00:33:28,862 --> 00:33:30,137
<i>
Going into a merge,</i>

812
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:31,310
the more relationships you have,

813
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:32,517
the more options you have.

814
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:34,344
<i>So I really need to feel out</i>

815
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:38,034
<i>Drea and Hai about the amulet</i> <i>
we got on day one.</i>

816
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:53,379
<i>
There's so many
possibilities for this amulet.</i>

817
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:56,172
<i>Do you work together,</i> <i>
or does greed take over?</i>

818
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:59,965
I have no idea
how it's going to be used yet.

819
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,034
The first time I read it,
I was like, ....

820
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:03,310
I know. Same.
I know.

821
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:04,689
Like, the first time
you read it,

822
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:05,482
it makes you think
you have to target each other.

823
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:08,206
So whoever needs my amulet...

824
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:09,655
Same.
Same, yeah.

825
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:11,758
The three together
steals a vote?

826
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:13,206
Is-is, no, a extra vote.

827
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:14,896
Extra vote, Steal a Vote, idol.
- Yeah.

828
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,482
<i>Lindsay, Drea and I</i> <i>
are saying,</i>

829
00:34:16,517 --> 00:34:19,586
<i>how about, instead of taking</i> <i>
each other out,</i>

830
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,827
let's work together and use our
amulets to further our games.

831
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,586
- Yeah.
- If I hear y'all's name, I will tell you.

832
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,655
- 100%.
- Please do me the same courtesy.

833
00:34:27,689 --> 00:34:29,586
<i>But at the same time,</i>

834
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,586
<i>I'm nervous these ladies</i> <i>
are gonna come for me,</i>

835
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,413
because they're
gonna want to grab power.

836
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,241
This game is
all about grabbing power.

837
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,172
<i>I just need to figure out</i> <i>
who's gonna strike first.</i>

838
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:47,620
Exactly. Knowing that, like...

839
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:52,068
- We just got to just lay low and let things happen.
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

840
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:54,172
<i>These past 12 days,</i>

841
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:55,724
<i>I didn't have much power</i> <i>
in the game.</i>

842
00:34:55,758 --> 00:34:58,758
But now,
not only do I have safety,

843
00:34:58,793 --> 00:35:02,275
but I have an immunity idol
which has been activated.

844
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,793
<i>And I also have an extra vote.</i>

845
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:07,482
Okay, don't worry.

846
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:09,034
I know. I'm gonna...
Don't worry.

847
00:35:09,068 --> 00:35:10,241
- I feel like...
- I'm a, I'm a little person, too.

848
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:13,448
I know. No, I know.

849
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:15,827
I know. I know.

850
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:19,413
<i>My strategy is listening</i> <i>
to what they want as a plan.</i>

851
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:22,793
<i>I don't want to say my plan,
but if someone says their plan,</i>

852
00:35:22,827 --> 00:35:24,827
I can be like,
"That's a great idea."

853
00:35:24,862 --> 00:35:27,206
And that puts them in
the spotlight rather than me.

854
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,724
What are your thoughts on Drea?

855
00:35:28,758 --> 00:35:29,758
'Cause I know you guys
went to summit together.

856
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:31,482
Like, I like Drea.
Like, I just think, like,

857
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:33,103
Drea is gonna be
a problem in the future.

858
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

859
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:40,103
Whoa.

860
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh, my gosh.

861
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:44,379
- There's so much more to you than just a bubbly personality.
- No.

862
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:47,206
Right now, I feel as if
I have just so many options

863
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:49,000
<i>that I can work with,</i> <i>
which is great,</i>

864
00:35:49,034 --> 00:35:52,586
<i>because in this game, you can't</i> <i>
go anywhere without allies.</i>

865
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:01,517
Yeah.

866
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:08,379
Thank you.

867
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,827
Yeah.

868
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:20,862
Yeah.

869
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:25,310
Yeah.

870
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:30,482
Because it feels...

871
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:38,275
<i>
Mike and I both</i>

872
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,827
<i>have been through a lot</i> <i>
in our life,</i>

873
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:41,862
and we can tell when
we look in each other's eyes.

874
00:36:41,896 --> 00:36:43,620
And we bonded over that.

875
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:45,206
<i>And that felt good.</i>

876
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,551
<i>Felt like I had somebody</i> <i>
caring about me,</i>

877
00:36:47,586 --> 00:36:49,344
<i>and I appreciate that.</i> <i>
He's gonna be my buddy</i>

878
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:51,034
<i>for a long time out here.</i>

879
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,517
Don't care what anybody thinks.
Be you.

880
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:56,034
- Yeah. That's good, though.
- Be you, and that's... and...

881
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:57,620
you are, you are you.
That's what I love about you.

882
00:36:57,655 --> 00:36:58,827
Yeah.

883
00:36:58,862 --> 00:37:00,379
<i>
Jonathan looks different,</i>

884
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:02,413
<i>he dresses different,</i> <i>
which I love.</i>

885
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:04,448
<i>There's a lot more to this guy</i>

886
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:05,965
than probably people
are giving credit for,

887
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,758
just being a strong
muscular guy who's dominating.

888
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,103
<i>I've been going through that</i> <i>
my whole life,</i>

889
00:37:11,137 --> 00:37:15,103
so I understand it hurts being
stigmatized as the big dummy.

890
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:16,379
<i>That was our bond.</i>

891
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:27,965
<i>
We're gonna go forward</i> <i>
looking out for each other,</i>

892
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,034
and maybe for once
in <i>Survivor</i> history,

893
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:31,517
the people
that are physically stronger

894
00:37:31,551 --> 00:37:32,724
<i>win this thing for a change.</i>

895
00:37:51,655 --> 00:37:53,551
Look under here. Look under here.
I see 'em. I see 'em.

896
00:37:53,586 --> 00:37:55,206
Right in that nook right there.
I see 'em.

897
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:56,827
Oh, I see 'em, too.

898
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:05,241
Oh. Are you all right?

899
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:07,103
Are you all right? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

900
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:09,103
Ah, there it is!
Right-right there!

901
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:10,965
Jonathan is a beast of a dude.</i>

902
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,620
<i>I like him a lot.</i>

903
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:15,482
Obviously, he's amazing
to have around camp.

904
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:17,206
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

905
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:21,103
<i>
Thank goodness for Jonathan,</i>

906
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:22,827
otherwise we would starve.

907
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:25,689
<i>He is the biggest human
being I've ever seen in my life.</i>

908
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:30,275
<i>And he's also just</i> <i>
incredibly athletic.</i>

909
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,862
- Oh! Oh, it's a stingray.
- Oh, my God.

910
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:36,344
That was a valiant effort. Yeah.

911
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:38,448
- He, like, really looks like a superhero.
- I know.

912
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,310
<i>
This man is so intimidating,</i> <i>
but I'm not</i>

913
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:44,689
going to oppose working with
someone I'm intimidated by.

914
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:49,413
<i>Jonathan is someone I would</i> <i>
love to keep in the game</i>

915
00:38:49,448 --> 00:38:51,517
due to his sheer physicality--

916
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:53,344
<i>just so I have a shield</i> <i>
in front of me.</i>

917
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:59,034
Yeah.
Yeah, I love hearing how people meet.

918
00:38:59,068 --> 00:39:00,862
So, I was commuting
for work.

919
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:02,172
So I was, like, really lonely.

920
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,758
- Yeah.
- So I downloaded Tinder.

921
00:39:04,793 --> 00:39:07,862
- Yeah.
- And all of a sudden, I receive a message.

922
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:09,517
And I was like,
"Who the hell is this?"

923
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:11,551
'Cause he had two blurry photos.

924
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:12,655
Yeah.

925
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:14,241
And no bio.
Oh, that's sketch.

926
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:15,344
That is sketch.

927
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:17,310
I'm surprised you responded.

928
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:19,724
Well, I didn't respond
at first, but he followed up.

929
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:22,241
<i>Hai is part of</i> <i>
the LGBT community,</i>

930
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:25,379
<i>and I'm part of the</i> <i>
LGBT community, but I still</i>

931
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:28,137
change myself a little bit to...

932
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:31,379
to fit in and be accepted.

933
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:33,931
And Hai doesn't care
about that stuff.

934
00:39:33,965 --> 00:39:38,413
<i>It's refreshing to meet
somebody that was the opposite--</i>

935
00:39:38,448 --> 00:39:40,206
somebody that's so
comfortable with themselves.

936
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:43,034
It feels good to be able to,
like, talk to somebody,

937
00:39:43,068 --> 00:39:45,517
you know, that understands, but...

938
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:47,931
...I grew up in
South Central L.A.

939
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:49,551
I come from an immigrant family.

940
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:52,310
It's not... it's not okay.
You know what I'm saying?

941
00:39:52,344 --> 00:39:57,137
So I had to adapt, and pretend
and be somebody that I was not.

942
00:39:57,172 --> 00:39:59,448
- Are you out to your family at home?
- Most of them.

943
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:01,103
- Yeah?
- I mean, there's a huge part of my family

944
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:03,620
back in El Salvador-- where
I'm from-- that don't know,

945
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:05,413
- that are gonna know watching.
- After this.

946
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:06,827
Which is terrifying.

947
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,413
Do you think they'll accept you?

948
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,724
I don't know.

949
00:40:10,758 --> 00:40:13,482
My biggest fear
for people like us is, like,

950
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:15,655
being looked at differently.

951
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:20,000
You don't want to...
people to stop loving you

952
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,965
or seeing you the way that
they've seen you for so many...

953
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,793
- Sorry.
- You're-you're still the same person.

954
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:26,827
Yeah. Let it out.

955
00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:30,000
I know. I know you've been
holding it in.

956
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:32,068
<i>
You can't hide on</i> Survivor.

957
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:35,206
<i>And my fear is</i>

958
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:38,034
will people back home
that didn't know about me

959
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,206
look at me differently
when I go back home

960
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:43,551
and-and love me less

961
00:40:43,586 --> 00:40:46,241
or-or not want to be around me?

962
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:54,000
That's my biggest fear
coming out here was, um...

963
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:58,793
...was disappointing people.

964
00:40:58,827 --> 00:41:00,620
- You have lots of support here.
- Yeah.

965
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:03,379
- Yeah.
- And I'm here for you,

966
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:05,137
and I don't want you
to feel as though

967
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,344
you need to, like, stay quiet,
just to fit in,

968
00:41:07,379 --> 00:41:09,655
because we've had to do that.

969
00:41:09,689 --> 00:41:11,448
Because I remember
how hard that was.

970
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:13,517
You should be the proud
gay man that you are out here.

971
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:19,448
<i>Finally, as an adult, I
don't want to blend in anymore.</i>

972
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:22,137
I'm living my truth out here
for the first time in my life,

973
00:41:22,172 --> 00:41:24,172
and-and it's while
I'm playing <i>Survivor.</i>

974
00:41:24,206 --> 00:41:27,103

00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:29,862
<i>I didn't know how much</i> <i>
it would really affect me,</i>

976
00:41:29,896 --> 00:41:32,379
but I'm gonna leave here

977
00:41:32,413 --> 00:41:34,482
like a different person,
for sure.

978
00:41:35,551 --> 00:41:36,724
No, I-I appreciate it.

979
00:41:36,758 --> 00:41:39,206
Like, I'll remember this
for a long time.

980
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:41,862
<i>It feels like a huge weight has</i> <i>
been lifted from my shoulders.</i>

981
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:44,241
That's something
that I will take with me...

982
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:46,517
...forever.

983
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:48,965
You guys excited for the next
phase of the game, or...

984
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,275
Uh, yeah,
I love the individual phase.

985
00:41:52,448 --> 00:41:53,689
Yeah.
Yeah.

986
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:55,482
Just...

987
00:41:55,517 --> 00:41:58,103
be, uh, wary of who you
give information to.

988
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:02,172
R... For you?

989
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:03,310
Yeah, I've been at the bottom.

990
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:04,586
You've been at the bottom?

991
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,758
They're gonna vote Lydia
and then me.

992
00:42:05,793 --> 00:42:07,344
That's so interesting,

993
00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:10,310
'cause on our hike, Chanelle
struck me as somebody who was,

994
00:42:10,344 --> 00:42:12,655
- like, very honest and, like, straightforward.
- No. Nope.

995
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:14,551
Really?
- She said, after the hike,

996
00:42:14,586 --> 00:42:15,551
she lost her vote.

997
00:42:15,586 --> 00:42:16,379
She lost it?

998
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:20,896
Yeah, that's so interesting.

999
00:42:20,931 --> 00:42:23,034
- So I just want you to know...
- I'm happy you told me that

1000
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:25,965
because I was trusting her
a little bit.

1001
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,862
Okay.

1002
00:42:27,896 --> 00:42:28,862
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1003
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:31,034
Chanelle lost her vote--

1004
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:33,896
<i>which means at the summit,</i> <i>
we both risked it,</i>

1005
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:35,724
<i>and I won't have a vote</i> <i>
at the next Tribal Council.</i>

1006
00:42:35,758 --> 00:42:37,517
<i>It's so scary.</i>

1007
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:41,068
This is the most danger I've
felt in the whole game so far.

1008
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:43,344
I just want to make sure, like,
you and I, we're-we're solid.

1009
00:42:43,379 --> 00:42:45,172
- Yeah, yeah.
- Like, the thing from the summit still stands.

1010
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:47,241
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. <i>
- I thought from the summit</i>

1011
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:48,241
that Chanelle and I had a bond,

1012
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,034
<i>but she doesn't trust me enough</i>

1013
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,482
<i>to tell me I won't have a vote,</i> <i>
and that's a problem.</i>

1014
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:55,517
<i>This girl is sketchy.</i>

1015
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:57,000
I don't want to be around her.
I want her gone.

1016
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:13,275
I... So, I didn't date
anyone until I was 24, 25.

1017
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,517
Eventually, we just
started dating...

1018
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,448
- Good for you, man. Nothing wrong with that.
- Um...

1019
00:43:26,862 --> 00:43:28,931
It is a long time.
That's a long time.

1020
00:43:28,965 --> 00:43:31,586
Yeah, but I think
the reason it's...

1021
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,103
- Yeah.
- Good for you, man.

1022
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:34,965
Good for you.

1023
00:43:42,448 --> 00:43:45,000
I literally vibe
with you so much.

1024
00:43:45,034 --> 00:43:46,620
- Oh, I know, I vibe with you.
- And, like, I feel...

1025
00:43:46,655 --> 00:43:48,206
- We're the youngins.
- Yes, we are. And we're...

1026
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:50,931
- Youngins got to stick together.
- With the old grandma names.

1027
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:52,310
Oh, my God.

1028
00:43:52,344 --> 00:43:55,068
Any good feelings
about anybody yet?

1029
00:43:55,103 --> 00:43:56,413
I like you and Lindsay.

1030
00:43:56,448 --> 00:43:58,413
Yeah. I love Omar.

1031
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:02,344
Love Mike.

1032
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:04,000
- I-I feel really good about Drea.
- Yeah.

1033
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:07,137
You have Lydia?
Hey, that's perfect.

1034
00:44:07,172 --> 00:44:09,137
D-Do you remember what I told
about the first Tribal?

1035
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:10,724
- No.
- I was willing to go to rocks for her.

1036
00:44:10,758 --> 00:44:12,172
- Not to go home.
- Yes. Yes.

1037
00:44:12,206 --> 00:44:14,517
And I'm telling you, like,
man-to-man...

1038
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,517
- Yeah.
- if I give you my word,

1039
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:18,896
what I did for Lydia
I will do for you.

1040
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:21,206
<i>Everyone's</i> <i>
opening up and bonding,</i>

1041
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,827
<i>and sharing our life stories</i> <i>
and cracking jokes.</i>

1042
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,862
Are you Buff-shaming me 'cause
I don't have a Buff?

1043
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:29,551
- Oh. It's going to your head.
- Oh, my God, you're...

1044
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:31,310
- You're Buff-shaming me.
- Oh!

1045
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:34,310
<i>Which is great, but now</i>

1046
00:44:34,344 --> 00:44:36,206
I need to establish agency.

1047
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:40,862
Whether it be through
my social skills,

1048
00:44:40,896 --> 00:44:42,793
<i>wrangling people together,</i>

1049
00:44:42,827 --> 00:44:45,827
<i>I need to get my numbers</i> <i>
in order</i>

1050
00:44:45,862 --> 00:44:47,517
and have
a clear path to the end.

1051
00:44:49,172 --> 00:44:51,448
- Lydia and I are together. Okay.
- For sure.

1052
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:53,689
And Mike is a man of his word.

1053
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,034
If Mike shakes your hand,
you're good.

1054
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,655
So he's taking you to the end.
Mike is...

1055
00:44:57,689 --> 00:44:59,310
Mike is like Rocks.
Rocks is like Mike.

1056
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:02,241
Rocksroy is <i>solid.</i>

1057
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:05,448
- Okay. I knew that. I knew...
- And Jonathan, so yeah, you, Lindsay and Omar

1058
00:45:05,482 --> 00:45:07,034
- are super tight?
- Yeah, super tight.

1059
00:45:07,068 --> 00:45:09,241
- Good.
- So just throwing numbers out there.

1060
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:10,448
You and Rocks.

1061
00:45:10,482 --> 00:45:11,827
- You, Lindsay, Omar.
- Mm.

1062
00:45:11,862 --> 00:45:13,482
Me, Lyds and Mike.

1063
00:45:13,517 --> 00:45:15,137
Would-would everyone
feel comfortable with that?

1064
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:17,344
I'm-
- I'm down with that.
I'm good with this group.

1065
00:45:17,379 --> 00:45:18,655
<i>
I'm a driver.</i>

1066
00:45:18,689 --> 00:45:20,482
<i>I can't take the back seat.</i>

1067
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,000
<i>I need to establish the allies</i> <i>
that I need to protect.</i>

1068
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:25,137
And then I need to identify

1069
00:45:25,172 --> 00:45:27,310
the threats
that I need to eliminate.

1070
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:28,965
I would also like
to share something,

1071
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,965
if you're comfortable
about Chanelle.

1072
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,551
So...

1073
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:34,137
<i>truthfully,</i> <i>
Chanelle was gonna be next.</i>

1074
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:36,275
<i>She flip-flops, and</i>

1075
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,482
please be careful
what you share with her,

1076
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:39,206
because she plays all sides.

1077
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:40,482
What's been going on
in our tribe?

1078
00:45:40,517 --> 00:45:43,206
Tori has been trying
to blindside everyone

1079
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,137
<i>since day one.
She's going to screw you over.</i>

1080
00:45:45,172 --> 00:45:46,275
- <i>-
- Know what I mean?</i> <i> Right.</i> <i> Mm.</i>

1081
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,172
Be careful. Yeah.

1082
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:51,172
Our next to go
would be Maryanne,

1083
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,862
<i>but she hasn't even done</i> <i>
anything to hurt our tribe.</i>

1084
00:45:53,896 --> 00:45:55,517
- <i>-
- She was just the next to go.</i> <i> Right.</i>

1085
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:56,896
<i>
So here's the thing.</i> <i>
They're-they're immune.</i>

1086
00:45:56,931 --> 00:45:58,206
It's tricky. That's the issue.</i>

1087
00:45:58,241 --> 00:45:59,896
Yeah. <i>
It seems</i>

1088
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:01,931
to be starting up very well,

1089
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:03,379
as far as strategy.

1090
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:06,275
<i>So, Tori would be</i> <i>
one of the first gone.</i>

1091
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:09,068
<i>Chanelle: gone.</i> <i>
I threw out Maryanne's name</i>

1092
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:12,241
cause I don't want them think
that we're super close.

1093
00:46:12,275 --> 00:46:14,551
And if I'm gonna throw
anybody's name out on my tribe

1094
00:46:14,586 --> 00:46:17,103
that I don't trust,
it would be Maryanne.

1095
00:46:17,137 --> 00:46:18,413
<i>But here's the catch.</i>

1096
00:46:18,448 --> 00:46:21,965
<i>Tori and Maryanne are already</i> <i>
safe at the next Tribal.</i>

1097
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,172
<i>And let me tell you,</i> <i>
that's bad news for Chanelle.</i>

1098
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:28,000
Dude, I'm, like,
we're nowhere near the end.

1099
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:30,620
It's impossible.

1100
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,862
Me and Jonathan
went out there, and, like,

1101
00:46:31,896 --> 00:46:33,413
the net would not
catch anything.

1102
00:46:33,448 --> 00:46:34,965
Hey.
We went, like, neck-deep.

1103
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,620
What up? What up, what up?
Neck-deep?

1104
00:46:36,655 --> 00:46:38,068
- You were neck-deep?
- We're up to, like, our...

1105
00:46:38,103 --> 00:46:39,517
We were up to, like, our necks.

1106
00:46:39,551 --> 00:46:40,931
<i>
There is an urgency out here,</i>

1107
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,172
<i>because being in the majority</i>

1108
00:46:42,206 --> 00:46:45,344
of the tribe is as simple as

1109
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:47,034
<i>you weren't</i> <i>
in the right conversation</i>

1110
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:48,862
<i>at the right time, at the right</i> <i>
moment, with the right people.</i>

1111
00:46:48,896 --> 00:46:50,413
Well, we're gonna go crabbing.

1112
00:46:50,448 --> 00:46:52,448
The tide is down.

1113
00:46:52,482 --> 00:46:54,137
<i>
I'm just gonna walk up</i> <i>
on this group and say "Hey."</i>

1114
00:46:54,172 --> 00:46:56,034
<i>Then they all get up and say,</i> <i>
"I'm gonna go spearfishing."</i>

1115
00:46:56,068 --> 00:46:59,758
And so, I'm, like, trying
to find my place right now.

1116
00:46:59,793 --> 00:47:02,206
And, uh, I'm trying to find
who I trust.

1117
00:47:02,241 --> 00:47:05,896
- Ugh. That moment with Chanelle was not good on me.
- No.

1118
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:08,206
I felt like I was intruding
when I went over there,

1119
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:09,862
- when you guys were all talking.
- Oh, no.

1120
00:47:09,896 --> 00:47:13,034
We briefly discussed, um,
Rocksroy, and just, like,

1121
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:16,344
- trying to figure out, like, what's going on there.
- Yeah.

1122
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:19,034
- Of course...
- Are you guys trying to, like, make a, like, a five?

1123
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:20,689
- Oh. No. Oh, no, no, no. It was none of that.
- Oh, no? Oh. Oh.

1124
00:47:20,724 --> 00:47:22,689
<i>
No one trusts her.</i>

1125
00:47:22,724 --> 00:47:24,172
<i>And so, I'm playing dumb.</i>

1126
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:26,827
Like, I'm just, like,
"Like, no."

1127
00:47:26,862 --> 00:47:29,413
<i>Like, I'm really just trying</i> <i>
to keep her</i>

1128
00:47:29,448 --> 00:47:30,517
<i>as comfortable as possible.</i>

1129
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:32,241
Have you heard any names
on the block yet?

1130
00:47:32,275 --> 00:47:33,241
Oh, no, no, no.

1131
00:47:33,275 --> 00:47:34,413
Yeah, um...

1132
00:47:35,862 --> 00:47:37,068
- Yeah.
- Our final three.

1133
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:39,137
Yeah, for sure.

1134
00:47:39,172 --> 00:47:41,379
<i>
Lydia, I trusted,</i> <i>
but she just seems like</i>

1135
00:47:41,413 --> 00:47:43,034
<i>she's holding so much back.</i>

1136
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,655
<i>I can see it. We talk,
she doesn't look me in my eyes.</i>

1137
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:47,517
She just seems like
she's out of it.

1138
00:47:47,551 --> 00:47:50,000
And it's, like, very...
makes me very uneasy.

1139
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,689
<i>I really don't trust anyone,</i> <i>
to be quite honest.</i>

1140
00:47:52,724 --> 00:47:54,551
<i>It's so scary,</i> <i>
because you don't know</i>

1141
00:47:54,586 --> 00:47:57,206
who's made these
underlying side deals,

1142
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,689
<i>under-the-table deals.</i>

1143
00:47:58,724 --> 00:48:00,482
Everything's lining up
with the eight that we have.

1144
00:48:00,517 --> 00:48:02,931
- Bro, I think it's solid.
- Yeah.

1145
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:04,413
Are you down with that, Omar?
- 100%.

1146
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:07,620
E-Except I don't know
if I have a vote or not.

1147
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:09,379
- You don't know?
- Because of the summit.

1148
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:11,413
Chanelle screwed him.

1149
00:48:11,448 --> 00:48:12,586
Yeah, Chanelle...
She lost her vote.

1150
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,137
Are we together?

1151
00:48:14,172 --> 00:48:15,275
Like, we're-we're tight, right?
Yes.
Yeah.

1152
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,482
I have an extra vote.

1153
00:48:19,448 --> 00:48:22,448
<i>I have trusted my gut that I'm
aligned with the right people.</i>

1154
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,724
We need to stick to the eight.

1155
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:27,000
So I wanted to tell them
about the extra vote,

1156
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:29,931
<i>because it could really build</i> <i>
connections with people.</i>

1157
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:33,620
We've caught Tori in so many
lies, and she does it so well.

1158
00:48:33,655 --> 00:48:34,896
<i>We need to get her out.</i>

1159
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:36,620
<i>
But she's safe right now.</i>

1160
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:38,034
<i>
We don't know what</i> <i>
Rocksroy brings home.</i>

1161
00:48:38,068 --> 00:48:39,724
Oh. Unless immunity...
Unless Rocksroy changes it.

1162
00:48:39,758 --> 00:48:41,655
But everyone votes.
But everyone votes.

1163
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:43,586
Either Chanelle or Tori,
'cause they're separated.

1164
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,068
Yep.

1165
00:48:45,103 --> 00:48:47,206
This first vote is tricky,

1166
00:48:47,241 --> 00:48:50,068
<i>because we've been subdivided</i> <i>
into two groups--</i>

1167
00:48:50,103 --> 00:48:52,793
<i>people who are safe</i> <i>
safe from the vote</i>

1168
00:48:52,827 --> 00:48:54,965
<i>and those that are</i> <i>
vulnerable to go home.</i>

1169
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,034
<i>But fortunately, we have some
early low-hanging-fruit targets</i>

1170
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,620
<i>for the first few Tribals.</i>

1171
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:01,379
- I'm telling you, Chanelle is killer at Tribal.
- Yeah.

1172
00:49:01,413 --> 00:49:02,482
And she's coming right now.

1173
00:49:02,517 --> 00:49:04,310
Okay.
Yeah.

1174
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:05,827
We have to make Chanelle feel...

1175
00:49:05,862 --> 00:49:07,827
Yeah, 'cause the last time
she came, we split up, so...

1176
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,275
- just talk.
- Yeah. <i> Chanelle has proven</i>

1177
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:12,896
<i>that she's not loyal to me,</i> <i>
since my very first Tribal.</i>

1178
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:15,034
And there's only one more person
on my hit list

1179
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:17,103
that betrayed me--
and that's poor Chanelle.

1180
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:20,275
We're talking about, like,
we all have good vibes.

1181
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,448
And they all really like you.

1182
00:49:21,482 --> 00:49:22,517
Yeah.

1183
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,724
Yeah.

1184
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,965
I'm gonna go check that spot for spearfishing.
Yeah, I'll come with you.

1185
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,482
- I'm gonna go get the scuba gear. You want to come with us?
- I actually want to enjoy

1186
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:34,965
the beach, too. You want to enjoy it with me?
I'll enjoy the beach.

1187
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,758
Yeah.

1188
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,482
Oh, gosh. Love that.

1189
00:49:50,517 --> 00:49:51,551
Pop, pop.

1190
00:49:51,586 --> 00:49:53,689
Don't want to drop a grain.

1191
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,172
<i>Spending time by myself,</i>

1192
00:49:56,206 --> 00:49:58,379
away from the social aspect
of the game a bit.

1193
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:00,103
<i>Oh, I love it.</i>

1194
00:50:00,137 --> 00:50:02,551
<i>I've worked so hard</i> <i>
for two days, and...</i>

1195
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:03,965
I just want
to relax a little bit...

1196
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,034
This is just
for a little bit of flavor.

1197
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:08,517
<i>...and not having</i> <i>
to think about the game.</i>

1198
00:50:16,586 --> 00:50:18,931
Let's go get 'em hot.
Get 'em hot. Get 'em hot.

1199
00:50:24,206 --> 00:50:25,379
Yippee ki-yay.

1200
00:50:25,413 --> 00:50:27,448
Time for some rice.

1201
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,344
Oh, yeah, buddy.

1202
00:50:30,517 --> 00:50:32,034
Jeff!

1203
00:50:32,068 --> 00:50:33,827
- Hey!
- Rocksroy!

1204
00:50:33,862 --> 00:50:36,275
- Welcome to the pad, buddy.
- What's up?

1205
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,793
Wow. You got a shelter.

1206
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,379
Yeah, I built a shelter.

1207
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:41,206
I had to rush everything,
but, you know.

1208
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:42,793
This is impressive.

1209
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:44,862
Jeff's coming to visit me, okay?</i>

1210
00:50:44,896 --> 00:50:47,103
<i>So I was like, "Wow."</i>

1211
00:50:47,137 --> 00:50:49,206
<i>But at the same time,</i> <i>
I'm a little nervous,</i>

1212
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:52,793
'cause there's always some type
of twist and turn in this game.

1213
00:50:52,827 --> 00:50:54,965
I'm sorry, I may interrupt you
to take my rice off.

1214
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,827
I love it.

1215
00:50:56,862 --> 00:50:59,965
So, how are you feeling,
being out here?

1216
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,068
I really wanted to experience
what it is to, like,

1217
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:05,034
not only be on <i>Survivor,</i>
but a survivalist.

1218
00:51:05,068 --> 00:51:07,896
But I think having
this moment of zen, kind of,

1219
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:09,172
I think it helps me.

1220
00:51:09,206 --> 00:51:10,517
So it's like a pause,

1221
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:13,034
- and then the next stage of the game.
- Exactly.

1222
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:14,931
- So let's recap where we are, all right?
- Mm-hmm.

1223
00:51:14,965 --> 00:51:18,034
Right now we have
the six that are safe.

1224
00:51:18,068 --> 00:51:20,896
They got the Buff.
They don't have to compete

1225
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:21,758
- in the immunity challenge.
- Yeah.

1226
00:51:21,793 --> 00:51:23,103
You and the other five,

1227
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:25,551
you will have to compete
in that immunity challenge.

1228
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:26,965
One of you will win,

1229
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,275
and one of the other five
will go home.

1230
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:31,068
Doesn't have to be that way.

1231
00:51:31,103 --> 00:51:32,344
Huh?

1232
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:34,241
Where's that hourglass?

1233
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:36,034
The one I've been
trying to figure out

1234
00:51:36,068 --> 00:51:37,965
- what the heck it's here for?
- Yeah.

1235
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,896
I've been counting it out,
trying to see

1236
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,413
if it's a real hour.

1237
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:42,448
- This one.
- That one.

1238
00:51:42,482 --> 00:51:43,724
Yeah, set it between us.

1239
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:47,172
So, the sand at the bottom

1240
00:51:47,206 --> 00:51:50,034
represents time that has passed.

1241
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:51,172
- Correct.
- History.

1242
00:51:51,206 --> 00:51:52,448
Yes.

1243
00:51:52,482 --> 00:51:54,344
You can leave things
as they are.

1244
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:57,103
- Right.
- Or you can go back in time...

1245
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,896
...and change history,

1246
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:02,620
by reversing the outcome
of the challenge.

1247
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:07,931
They would lose their Buff,
they would lose their immunity.

1248
00:52:07,965 --> 00:52:09,758
You six would be safe,

1249
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,172
and one of those six
would be voted out.

1250
00:52:11,206 --> 00:52:13,241
Whoa.

1251
00:52:13,275 --> 00:52:16,965
There are pros and cons
to doing it or not doing it.

1252
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,655
I immediately think
of the con of doing it.

1253
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,344
There's a huge target on me.

1254
00:52:22,379 --> 00:52:24,241
"Why did you do that to us?"

1255
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:25,965
On the other hand,

1256
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,275
I have Drea and Romeo
that's already in my alliance.

1257
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,344
So those are people
you would be helping.

1258
00:52:32,379 --> 00:52:35,034
- And maybe they will somewhat protect me for a while.
- Mm.

1259
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,275
Because at least
I protected them.

1260
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,517
It's a big decision.

1261
00:52:38,551 --> 00:52:41,241
If you decide to do nothing,

1262
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:42,620
then just do nothing.

1263
00:52:42,655 --> 00:52:44,724
If you decide to change history,

1264
00:52:44,758 --> 00:52:46,517
at any time between
now and tomorrow morning,

1265
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:48,206
when you return to the game,

1266
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:51,344
find that mallet,
smash that glass.

1267
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:52,620
That's your decision.

1268
00:52:52,655 --> 00:52:54,896
<i>
This is the biggest moment</i>

1269
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:56,275
<i>in the game so far.</i>

1270
00:52:57,551 --> 00:53:00,344
And the decision lies with me.

1271
00:53:00,379 --> 00:53:02,206
Awesome.

1272
00:53:03,482 --> 00:53:06,310
<i>Wow. Now it's time to play.</i>

1273
00:53:06,344 --> 00:53:08,689
<i>I am a honorable player,</i>

1274
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:11,482
<i>but the five that</i> <i>
are currently vulnerable</i>

1275
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:12,689
<i>lost, fair and square.</i>

1276
00:53:12,724 --> 00:53:15,689
<i>Hey, not everyone gets a trophy.</i>

1277
00:53:15,724 --> 00:53:18,241
You lost--
better luck next time.

1278
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:20,862
<i>But if I leave it</i> <i>
and I don't smash it,</i>

1279
00:53:20,896 --> 00:53:22,103
<i>I'm gonna be vulnerable.</i>

1280
00:53:22,137 --> 00:53:24,482
<i>The six that are safe</i> <i>
right now--</i>

1281
00:53:24,517 --> 00:53:27,827
<i>would they look out for me</i> <i>
and not vote for me?</i>

1282
00:53:27,862 --> 00:53:30,655
<i>How much weight does
it carry for me going forward?</i>

1283
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,448
And then there's
the Tori factor.

1284
00:53:33,482 --> 00:53:35,137
<i>That's the big factor.</i>

1285
00:53:35,172 --> 00:53:37,448
<i>Where does she stand?</i>

1286
00:53:37,482 --> 00:53:40,689
<i>Tori's a loose cannon,</i> <i>
and right now she's safe.</i>

1287
00:53:40,724 --> 00:53:43,758
<i>But with one swing of a hammer,</i> <i>
she's vulnerable.</i>

1288
00:53:43,793 --> 00:53:45,344
<i>It's tremendous power.</i>

1289
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:47,655
Ah, it's just a tough decision.

1290
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:49,620
<i>Do I smash the glass</i>

1291
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:52,241
<i>or do I just walk away?</i>

1292
00:53:52,275 --> 00:53:54,758
You know, the devil you do
or the devil don't.

1293
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:12,517
Come on in.

1294
00:54:14,206 --> 00:54:15,000
Oh.

1295
00:54:25,413 --> 00:54:27,379
Let's bring in Rocksroy,

1296
00:54:27,413 --> 00:54:31,241
returning from two days
and two nights exiled alone.

1297
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,275
My man.

1298
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:37,862
Right up here, Rocksroy.

1299
00:54:42,034 --> 00:54:44,034
All right, so first,
how are you?

1300
00:54:44,068 --> 00:54:47,068
Two days, two nights. Long time
to be alone on your own.

1301
00:54:47,103 --> 00:54:48,379
- Yeah.
- How'd it go?

1302
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:51,068
It was tiring. Had to do
everything by yourself.

1303
00:54:51,103 --> 00:54:54,862
Blessed that there was no rain,
um, but it was tough.

1304
00:54:54,896 --> 00:54:55,931
It was real tough.

1305
00:54:55,965 --> 00:54:56,931
All right.

1306
00:54:56,965 --> 00:54:59,758
When you sent Rocksroy away,

1307
00:54:59,793 --> 00:55:02,379
you gave him
the power to change the game.

1308
00:55:02,413 --> 00:55:06,275
Rocksroy has the power to leave
things exactly as they are.

1309
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,275
Whatever happened, happened.

1310
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,827
You six are safe,

1311
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:11,896
you don't have to compete, or...

1312
00:55:11,931 --> 00:55:15,965
Rocksroy has the power
to go back in time

1313
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
and change history

1314
00:55:18,034 --> 00:55:20,793
by reversing the outcome of the challenge.
Oh, my God.

1315
00:55:25,034 --> 00:55:28,655
Which means the six of you
would lose your Buff--

1316
00:55:28,689 --> 00:55:30,344
because you're not part
of the merge tribe--

1317
00:55:30,379 --> 00:55:33,517
and you six would have to
compete and fight for immunity.

1318
00:55:33,551 --> 00:55:35,482
You five and Rocksroy
would be safe

1319
00:55:35,517 --> 00:55:37,758
and would not have to compete.

1320
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,448
Huge stakes.
Oh, my God. Rocksroy.

1321
00:55:39,482 --> 00:55:41,655
What decision did you make?

1322
00:55:48,551 --> 00:55:51,827
So if I smash it,
six people get a do-over.

1323
00:55:53,034 --> 00:55:54,482
If I leave it on its side...

1324
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:57,827
...nothing happens.

1325
00:56:06,172 --> 00:56:08,172
Sometimes everyone
deserves a do-over.

1326
00:56:10,517 --> 00:56:12,896
I went back
and I changed history.

1327
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:15,344
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1328
00:56:15,379 --> 00:56:17,517
Oh, Rocksroy.

1329
00:56:17,551 --> 00:56:21,137
So, in my thoughts,
they didn't get to eat.

1330
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:23,206
They didn't get to do anything.
Oh, my God.

1331
00:56:23,241 --> 00:56:25,137
These guys, they got to eat.
They got,

1332
00:56:25,172 --> 00:56:26,034
they got, they got
something in their belly.

1333
00:56:26,068 --> 00:56:28,000
They have some energy.

1334
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:29,689
Go out there and do it.

1335
00:56:29,724 --> 00:56:33,034
All right, so, reactions.

1336
00:56:33,068 --> 00:56:35,689
Hai, you're smiling,
but I'm not sure you're happy.

1337
00:56:35,724 --> 00:56:38,241
- There are no free meals this season.
- Yeah.

1338
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:40,172
I know that.
I respect his choice.

1339
00:56:40,206 --> 00:56:42,172
We had a great meal.

1340
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:46,689
You know, I felt good about
being safe, but it's time to...

1341
00:56:46,724 --> 00:56:48,344
it's time to compete. Tori,

1342
00:56:48,379 --> 00:56:50,241
you can hardly
look over this way.

1343
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:52,379
Keep in mind we sent you

1344
00:56:52,413 --> 00:56:54,655
not just to be exiled
for two days by yourself.

1345
00:56:54,689 --> 00:56:57,034
We sent you knowing
that you had power.

1346
00:56:57,068 --> 00:57:00,137
So I'm pretty pissed off that
that ended up happening,

1347
00:57:00,172 --> 00:57:02,103
because I actually was
doing that to maybe help you.

1348
00:57:03,655 --> 00:57:06,586
So, Tori, you're saying
that your decision

1349
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,310
to not take the power yourself
and give it to Rocksroy

1350
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:11,034
was a gift to Rocksroy.

1351
00:57:11,068 --> 00:57:12,275
Partially.

1352
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:13,931
I mean, I really,
I know Rocksroy.

1353
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:15,896
I got to live with him
for quite a few days,

1354
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:17,724
and I feel like if he had
the choice between food

1355
00:57:17,758 --> 00:57:19,241
or gaining power in this game,

1356
00:57:19,275 --> 00:57:20,931
he was gonna choose power.

1357
00:57:20,965 --> 00:57:22,310
But what can I do?

1358
00:57:22,344 --> 00:57:23,793
Tori, you should know that

1359
00:57:23,827 --> 00:57:26,275
if I'm sent someplace,
I'm gonna stick with how I feel.

1360
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,000
I'm gonna make a decision.

1361
00:57:28,034 --> 00:57:29,586
All right.

1362
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:33,068
Lydia, Maryanne, Lindsay,
Tori, Hai, Jonathan,

1363
00:57:33,103 --> 00:57:36,655
drop your Buffs. You are
not part of the merge tribe.

1364
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:39,793
One of you
won't even make the jury.

1365
00:57:42,413 --> 00:57:44,620
Oh, my God.

1366
00:57:44,655 --> 00:57:46,620
As for the rest of you, Rocksroy,
- That is savage.

1367
00:57:46,655 --> 00:57:48,586
head over,
give everybody a Buff,

1368
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:52,655
because you, Chanelle, Drea,
Romeo, Mike and Omar

1369
00:57:52,689 --> 00:57:55,241
are now in the merge tribe.

1370
00:57:55,275 --> 00:57:57,206
Guaranteed a spot
in the final 11.

1371
00:57:57,241 --> 00:57:59,310
- Cannot be voted out tonight.
- Yes.

1372
00:57:59,344 --> 00:58:00,965
Go ahead and put your Buffs on.

1373
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,379
Wow, it smells clean.

1374
00:58:04,862 --> 00:58:06,344
All right, let's get to it.

1375
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:07,965
For today's challenge,
you're gonna pull

1376
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
<i>on a rope
while balancing a wobbly table</i>

1377
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:12,793
<i>and stacking letter blocks.</i>

1378
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:14,724
<i>If at any point</i> <i>
your stack drops,</i>

1379
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:16,896
<i>you have to start over.</i>

1380
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:18,344
<i>First person</i> <i>
to spell "immunity"...</i>

1381
00:58:21,137 --> 00:58:23,172
...wins immunity.

1382
00:58:23,206 --> 00:58:24,241
This is what you're playing for.

1383
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,862
That looks awesome.

1384
00:58:29,896 --> 00:58:31,275
That's sweet.

1385
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,517
That's pretty badass.

1386
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:33,689
That's badass. Badass.

1387
00:58:33,724 --> 00:58:35,034
Very nice. Very nice.

1388
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:37,551
Individual immunity
with this around your neck,

1389
00:58:37,586 --> 00:58:38,689
you are safe.

1390
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,482
Cannot be voted out of the game.

1391
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,793
Win today's challenge,

1392
00:58:41,827 --> 00:58:43,862
you are guaranteed
a spot in the final 11.

1393
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:45,344
You'll definitely be
on the jury.

1394
00:58:45,379 --> 00:58:46,551
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody

1395
00:58:46,586 --> 00:58:48,965
will be the seventh person
voted out

1396
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,068
and will fall this short
of making the jury.

1397
00:58:52,379 --> 00:58:54,379
Big stakes.
We're gonna draw for spots.

1398
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:55,862
We'll get started. Here we go.

1399
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:57,517
You can sit here and watch.

1400
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:06,448
Here we go.

1401
00:59:06,482 --> 00:59:09,068
Biggest twist of the season.

1402
00:59:09,103 --> 00:59:11,620
Immunity on the line.
One will be safe.

1403
00:59:11,655 --> 00:59:13,724
The other five,
somebody going home tonight.

1404
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,241
Survivors ready.

1405
00:59:16,965 --> 00:59:18,000
Go.

1406
00:59:21,896 --> 00:59:24,344
You've got to spell
"immunity" backwards,

1407
00:59:24,379 --> 00:59:25,896
from the bottom to the top.

1408
00:59:25,931 --> 00:59:27,448
I-M-M-U-N-I...

1409
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:30,034
If your stack drops,
you got to start over.

1410
00:59:30,068 --> 00:59:31,931
Everybody racing out
with that first letter.

1411
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:36,758
Six people, who, moments ago,
thought they were safe...

1412
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:40,172
...now fighting to be safe.

1413
00:59:40,206 --> 00:59:42,965
Jonathan back first.
Has his second block.

1414
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,379
He's heading back out.

1415
00:59:44,413 --> 00:59:47,068
Everybody else pretty even.

1416
00:59:47,103 --> 00:59:48,862
Good job, everyone.
Couple of different ways to play this.

1417
00:59:48,896 --> 00:59:50,724
You can be very slow
and steady...

1418
00:59:52,137 --> 00:59:53,793
...or, if you're behind,

1419
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:56,034
- you may have to get a little more aggressive.
- Whoa.

1420
00:59:56,068 --> 00:59:58,068
But as your stack grows,

1421
00:59:58,103 --> 01:00:01,689
that wobbly table
becomes much more important.

1422
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:03,241
Oh, no.

1423
01:00:03,275 --> 01:00:05,551
Maryanne dropped...
Oh, Maryanne let everything go.

1424
01:00:05,586 --> 01:00:07,413
I'm not sure why.

1425
01:00:07,448 --> 01:00:09,551
I dropped one.
I don't want to mess up.

1426
01:00:09,586 --> 01:00:10,689
It's easier just to start over.

1427
01:00:10,724 --> 01:00:12,241
All right, that makes sense.

1428
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,689
Jonathan places
his second block.

1429
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:16,586
Tori places hers.
They're even.

1430
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,793
It is Tori and Jonathan
right now.

1431
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:20,172
Here comes Maryanne--
still smiling.

1432
01:00:21,965 --> 01:00:23,931
Hai places his second block.

1433
01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:26,793
Here comes Lindsay
out with her second.

1434
01:00:26,827 --> 01:00:29,068
- Let's go, guys.
- Eight letters total.

1435
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:31,413
Good work.
- Still a lot of challenge left.

1436
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,862
Hai places his sixth block.

1437
01:00:58,896 --> 01:01:00,689
It is Hai in the lead
right now.

1438
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:03,827
Then Jonathan, then Lindsay,

1439
01:01:03,862 --> 01:01:06,241
then Tori, then Lydia

1440
01:01:06,275 --> 01:01:07,241
and then Maryanne.

1441
01:01:07,275 --> 01:01:09,862
I-M-M-U-N.

1442
01:01:09,896 --> 01:01:13,620
Hai is now two blocks away from
winning individual immunity.

1443
01:01:13,655 --> 01:01:16,655
Now you're gonna see the
adrenaline start to kick in...

1444
01:01:16,689 --> 01:01:20,620
- Ah.
- as Hai gets closer and closer to closing this out.

1445
01:01:20,655 --> 01:01:23,793
Tori trying to get out quickly
with her sixth,

1446
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:25,862
as Hai reaches for his seventh.

1447
01:01:25,896 --> 01:01:27,344
Let's go, Hai.
You got this, buddy.

1448
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:28,827
He has two left.

1449
01:01:30,793 --> 01:01:32,137
Lydia drops.

1450
01:01:32,172 --> 01:01:33,482
Lydia's got to start over.

1451
01:01:33,517 --> 01:01:36,034
It's still Hai in the lead.

1452
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:37,655
He's coming out
with his seventh block.

1453
01:01:38,689 --> 01:01:41,655
Hai loses everything.

1454
01:01:41,689 --> 01:01:45,862
It is now Tori and Jonathan
in the lead, just like that.

1455
01:01:45,896 --> 01:01:49,137
Tori now overtaking Jonathan.

1456
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,965
Tori places her seventh letter.

1457
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,758
She has one left.

1458
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:56,068
Jonathan coming out with his
seventh letter, still wobbling.

1459
01:01:56,103 --> 01:01:58,586
Jonathan drops everything!

1460
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,344
He's out.
It is now Tori in the lead.

1461
01:02:01,379 --> 01:02:04,137
Lindsay the only one
that can catch her right now.

1462
01:02:04,172 --> 01:02:07,068
Tori heading back for her eighth
and final letter.

1463
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:12,206
Jonathan, frustration.

1464
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:14,206
So close.

1465
01:02:14,241 --> 01:02:15,827
You got to keep fighting

1466
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:17,000
because anybody could drop
at any time,

1467
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:18,206
and suddenly,
you're in the lead.

1468
01:02:18,241 --> 01:02:19,758
Take it easy, guys.

1469
01:02:19,793 --> 01:02:21,344
Lindsay places her seventh.

1470
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:24,034
- She's heading back for her eighth.
- Easy.

1471
01:02:24,068 --> 01:02:26,862
Tori slowly reaching
for that eighth.

1472
01:02:28,724 --> 01:02:30,068
You have to be very careful.

1473
01:02:30,103 --> 01:02:32,103
You don't want to drop here.

1474
01:02:38,931 --> 01:02:41,862
Lindsay has
slowly increased her pace,

1475
01:02:41,896 --> 01:02:43,689
but it's making a difference.

1476
01:02:43,724 --> 01:02:45,586
She is gaining on Tori.

1477
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,655
Tori still in the lead.

1478
01:02:49,689 --> 01:02:51,689
You got to get all the way out.

1479
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:53,931
Then you got to get
all the way back to win this.

1480
01:02:55,517 --> 01:02:57,344
Lindsay is on the platform.

1481
01:02:57,379 --> 01:03:00,482
Now she's got to reach
for that eighth block

1482
01:03:00,517 --> 01:03:04,000
as Tori reaches
to place her eighth block.

1483
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:07,206
Lindsay has it.
She's heading back out.

1484
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:09,586
Aw.
Tori has her final block

1485
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,655
and a time advantage.

1486
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:14,034
Lindsay will have
to make up time,

1487
01:03:14,068 --> 01:03:16,241
or Tori will have
to make a mistake.

1488
01:03:19,241 --> 01:03:20,896
Aah!

1489
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:23,896
Lindsay drops everything.

1490
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:27,137
One little hesitation
on that rope,

1491
01:03:27,172 --> 01:03:29,448
everything is gone.

1492
01:03:29,482 --> 01:03:31,793
Lydia places her sixth.

1493
01:03:31,827 --> 01:03:35,724
And... drops everything. Done.

1494
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:39,137
It is now Tori and then
Maryanne, and that's it.

1495
01:03:39,172 --> 01:03:41,620
Maryanne heading back out

1496
01:03:41,655 --> 01:03:43,758
with her seventh block.

1497
01:03:43,793 --> 01:03:46,275
Maryanne could be in the lead
if something happened

1498
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:48,793
to Tori's stack.

1499
01:03:48,827 --> 01:03:50,448
- Ooh.
- Oh.

1500
01:03:50,482 --> 01:03:52,379
Tori with a lot of movement
on that stack,

1501
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:53,586
but it's staying together.

1502
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,068
Oh, my God.

1503
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:59,448
Tori is two steps away
from winning this challenge.

1504
01:03:59,482 --> 01:04:02,965
All she has to do is
get both feet on that platform

1505
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,827
with all of her blocks

1506
01:04:04,862 --> 01:04:06,620
- intact.
- Oh.

1507
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,724
Maryanne places
her seventh letter.

1508
01:04:13,586 --> 01:04:16,137
There's one.

1509
01:04:19,517 --> 01:04:21,034
Get it up there, girl.

1510
01:04:21,068 --> 01:04:22,896
I'm just...
Just do it.

1511
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:32,827
Tori has it! Tori wins
individual immunity.

1512
01:04:32,862 --> 01:04:35,379
Wow. Good job.
Will make the final 11, cannot

1513
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,172
- be voted out of the game,
- You got this.

1514
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,551
and the tears start to flow.
Good job.

1515
01:04:38,586 --> 01:04:40,620
Hey, you got this.
You got this.

1516
01:04:40,655 --> 01:04:42,103
Good job, everyone.

1517
01:04:42,137 --> 01:04:43,206
Okay? Good job, everyone.
Hey, fish.

1518
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,000
- Thank you.
- Good job.

1519
01:04:48,068 --> 01:04:49,310
All right, Tori, get over here.

1520
01:04:53,827 --> 01:04:56,034
Oh, my God. Oh.
Pinch me. Pinch me.

1521
01:04:56,068 --> 01:04:57,448
I'm literally about to pass out.

1522
01:04:57,482 --> 01:04:58,724
First individual immunity
of the season.

1523
01:04:58,758 --> 01:05:00,689
Yeah!

1524
01:05:00,724 --> 01:05:03,724
You are safe, cannot be voted
out of this game.

1525
01:05:03,758 --> 01:05:05,689
- Oh, my God.
- You will make the final 11.

1526
01:05:05,724 --> 01:05:07,172
You will at least be
on the jury.

1527
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:10,206
You're not going home tonight.
Maryanne, Lindsay,

1528
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:12,482
Lydia, Hai, Jonathan,

1529
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:14,793
one of the five of you
will be voted out.

1530
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,275
Your dream will come to an end.

1531
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:17,724
Everybody's voting tonight.

1532
01:05:17,758 --> 01:05:19,724
But you have one
of five choices.

1533
01:05:19,758 --> 01:05:21,862
- Won't be you. Congratulations. Grab your stuff.
- Thank you.

1534
01:05:21,896 --> 01:05:23,310
Head back to camp.
Yeah, great job, Tori.

1535
01:05:23,344 --> 01:05:25,034
See you tonight at Tribal.

1536
01:05:25,068 --> 01:05:28,103
<i>
Tori and Chanelle were</i> <i>
in trouble,</i>

1537
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:30,862
<i>and now they are both safe.</i>

1538
01:05:30,896 --> 01:05:33,344
So it was basically worst-case
scenario for everybody.

1539
01:05:33,379 --> 01:05:36,275
<i>And now we have to completely,</i> <i>
you know, 180</i>

1540
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,206
<i>and have
to have a whole different plan,</i>

1541
01:05:38,241 --> 01:05:39,724
<i>and it is going to be,</i>

1542
01:05:39,758 --> 01:05:42,000
like, every... just chaos.

1543
01:05:54,137 --> 01:05:56,206
Congrats, Tori.

1544
01:05:56,241 --> 01:05:58,034
Yeah, first immunity of the season!
- Thank you.

1545
01:05:58,068 --> 01:06:00,689
Tori!
Look at that necklace!

1546
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:02,206
Nice. I want to pet it.

1547
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:04,344
Ooh! Ah!

1548
01:06:04,379 --> 01:06:07,068
Welcome.
- Sweet. Where's the pool?

1549
01:06:07,103 --> 01:06:09,931
We haven't put it in yet, man.
We're waiting for you.

1550
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:11,862
- Good to meet you, bro.
- Good to meet you.

1551
01:06:11,896 --> 01:06:13,482
I hear you're
the fire guy over here.

1552
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:15,344
<i>
I am safe for tonight.</i>

1553
01:06:15,379 --> 01:06:17,172
I am safe for now.

1554
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:18,758
Guys that-that
did the challenge,

1555
01:06:18,793 --> 01:06:20,241
you know, I feel for you.
I really...

1556
01:06:20,275 --> 01:06:21,275
- Yeah.
- I definitely did.

1557
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,034
There's literally
no hard feelings from me.

1558
01:06:23,068 --> 01:06:24,931
<i>
Because I've been away,</i> <i>
I'm gonna have to build</i>

1559
01:06:24,965 --> 01:06:26,206
<i>alliances pretty quickly.</i>

1560
01:06:27,413 --> 01:06:30,344
Yeah, man, I'm gonna go see
if I can spear something.

1561
01:06:30,379 --> 01:06:31,482
Come on, man.

1562
01:06:31,517 --> 01:06:32,482
<i>But I don't know</i> <i>
what's been happening</i>

1563
01:06:32,517 --> 01:06:33,793
<i>in the last two days.</i>

1564
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,862
<i>I don't know what alliances
have been made. I have no clue.</i>

1565
01:06:35,896 --> 01:06:38,206
Can you get me a boat?
I'll go back to that island

1566
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:40,413
I was on for a couple more days.

1567
01:06:40,448 --> 01:06:42,275
Uh, like you, Rocksroy,
- I'm-
- I'm a straight shooter.

1568
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:44,034
I'm straight shooting.

1569
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:46,620
I'm not just saying this 'cause
you're here. You can ask Drea.

1570
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:49,034
She already put you
in this alliance.

1571
01:06:49,068 --> 01:06:50,827
- We got eight people.
- Okay.

1572
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:54,586
- I mean-
- I mean, it would be stupid.

1573
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,931
- He's gonna win everything.
- Yeah.

1574
01:06:55,965 --> 01:06:57,965
This is our chance. If we don't
do it now, we're dumb.

1575
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,586
Shut the front door.
- Yeah, bro.

1576
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,896
Oh, baby.
- Oh, my gosh.

1577
01:07:02,931 --> 01:07:04,310
- That's right.
- Aah.

1578
01:07:04,344 --> 01:07:05,724
He's spitting.

1579
01:07:05,758 --> 01:07:07,551
You see, these guys are
doing the guy...

1580
01:07:07,586 --> 01:07:09,689
I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1581
01:07:09,724 --> 01:07:12,137
Already.
I mean, did you not see it?

1582
01:07:12,172 --> 01:07:13,620
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Get out of here.

1583
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,310
I mean, Mike is so far up
Jonathan's ...

1584
01:07:16,344 --> 01:07:17,724
- it's disgusting.
- Yeah.

1585
01:07:17,758 --> 01:07:19,034
He's a beast, man.
Golden boy.

1586
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:21,724
Man after my own heart.
Yeah. For sure.

1587
01:07:21,758 --> 01:07:23,137
He is. He's a man's man.
I love that.

1588
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,827
You know how I am. Yeah.

1589
01:07:24,862 --> 01:07:26,448
<i>-
<i>He sleeps next to him.</i> <i>
Yeah.</i>

1590
01:07:26,482 --> 01:07:28,896
<i>
He... They wake up--</i> <i>
"Let's go see the sunset."</i>

1591
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:30,551
- Get out here.
- The energy. Did someone give you food?

1592
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:32,379
- Oh, my gosh.
- No, I'm just, like, honestly, this is sort of...

1593
01:07:32,413 --> 01:07:34,655
- Yeah. They're...
- This is the second part of <i>Survivor.</i>

1594
01:07:34,689 --> 01:07:36,344
- Yeah.
- And this is where Romeo comes out.

1595
01:07:36,379 --> 01:07:38,551
- Oh, come on. Yes. Yes.
- You know... you know who I am.

1596
01:07:38,586 --> 01:07:40,448
- You know who I am.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1597
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:43,206
<i>
I was terrified</i> <i>
because I didn't have a Buff.</i>

1598
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:45,448
Now it's like
I have power again,

1599
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:48,000
and I just feel like
a different person.

1600
01:07:48,034 --> 01:07:52,000
<i>I'm power hungry,</i> <i>
I want control again, and</i>

1601
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:53,793
I want Jonathan gone.

1602
01:07:53,827 --> 01:07:56,517
Here's the thing. If it's not
him, it's gonna be you.

1603
01:07:56,551 --> 01:07:58,689
- I know. I know.
- They're not gonna vote for one of the girls.

1604
01:07:58,724 --> 01:08:01,068
I know that physicality
is the merge boot. Yeah.

1605
01:08:03,724 --> 01:08:05,379
Mm-hmm.

1606
01:08:05,413 --> 01:08:07,034
<i>I really don't want</i> <i>
to vote for Jonathan,</i>

1607
01:08:07,068 --> 01:08:08,793
<i>but the thing is,</i> <i>
options are limited.</i>

1608
01:08:08,827 --> 01:08:10,586
It's, like, my butt
is on the line, too,

1609
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,517
and I'm talking
and I'm strategizing

1610
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:14,172
<i>and I'm scrambling, 'cause,
like, there's only five people</i>

1611
01:08:14,206 --> 01:08:16,586
<i>not safe for this Tribal--</i> <i>
Jonathan,</i>

1612
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,310
<i>Hai, me, Lindsay and Lydia.</i>

1613
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:27,448
Jonathan is going to be
a very physical threat,

1614
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:29,172
I think, going forward.

1615
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:30,413
- He's terrible with puzzles, though.
- Is he really?

1616
01:08:30,448 --> 01:08:31,862
And he's super helpful

1617
01:08:31,896 --> 01:08:32,620
- with having food.
- Which is fine, yeah.

1618
01:08:32,655 --> 01:08:35,034
- And, like, all of that.
- Mm-hmm.

1619
01:08:35,068 --> 01:08:37,034
- -I mean, I'm-
- I'm open.
- Yeah. For sure.
- Yeah, me, too.

1620
01:08:37,068 --> 01:08:39,275
- But, like, Maryanne-- she's all over the place.
- Yes.

1621
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:41,206
<i>
Like, she's going crazy</i> <i>
in her head,</i>

1622
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:43,862
<i>so many different things,</i> <i>
and she's super strategic.</i>

1623
01:08:43,896 --> 01:08:46,344
- Jonathan's not as strategic.
- Yeah.
- For sure.

1624
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:49,517
Do you think she has anything
other than the Shot in the Dark?

1625
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:51,931
Yeah?

1626
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:54,689
<i>My biggest pitch</i> <i>
is Maryanne-- that she has</i>

1627
01:08:54,724 --> 01:08:56,689
a lot of hidden ammo.

1628
01:08:56,724 --> 01:08:58,931
<i>And I don't want to pitch Hai</i>

1629
01:08:58,965 --> 01:09:00,275
<i>because I want</i> <i>
to work with Hai.</i>

1630
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,103
<i>Secondly, Hai told me that him</i>

1631
01:09:02,137 --> 01:09:03,862
<i>and Lydia were gonna go</i> <i>
for rocks for each other.</i>

1632
01:09:03,896 --> 01:09:05,517
So the only option left

1633
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:07,034
<i>is Maryanne.</i>

1634
01:09:07,068 --> 01:09:08,655
- Good chat.
- We can talk later. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1635
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:10,172
<i>
I need people</i> <i>
to be more fearful</i>

1636
01:09:10,206 --> 01:09:12,172
<i>of the power that she has versus</i>

1637
01:09:12,206 --> 01:09:14,517
a potential threat of me
or Jonathan,

1638
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:16,137
'cause that's what it seems
like it's coming down to.

1639
01:09:17,551 --> 01:09:19,137
- No.
- No. Did it for you?

1640
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:22,482
<i>
I see right through it.</i>

1641
01:09:22,517 --> 01:09:25,241
<i>Lindsay's put her pitch out
to protect herself and Jonathan.</i>

1642
01:09:25,275 --> 01:09:27,000
He catches food,
and people are mesmerized

1643
01:09:27,034 --> 01:09:29,172
by the "golden boy"
kind of thing.

1644
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:30,655
<i>He's not golden to me.</i>

1645
01:09:30,689 --> 01:09:33,482
Like, he could go on streak,
and that's always scary.

1646
01:09:33,517 --> 01:09:35,137
Because, you know?
Yup.

1647
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,344
Kind of seems like a no-brainer.

1648
01:09:37,379 --> 01:09:40,655
- Yeah, I'm definitely down with that. Like, it's not...
- Mm-hmm.

1649
01:09:40,689 --> 01:09:41,965
You guys can do what you want,
'cause, like, I have no...

1650
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,275
- I'm safe, and I have no vote.
- No, it's fine.

1651
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:44,413
- So, ultimately, it's your game.
- Mm-hmm.

1652
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:46,413
<i>My first instinct,</i>

1653
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,000
knowing that I'm safe
and I don't have a vote,

1654
01:09:49,034 --> 01:09:52,275
is to just shut the heck up
and not say anything.

1655
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,241
Because why?
Why would I jeopardize

1656
01:09:54,275 --> 01:09:56,000
<i>my position in the game?</i>

1657
01:09:56,034 --> 01:09:59,000
<i>But the more I thought about it,</i> <i>
I'm like, "This is terrible."</i>

1658
01:09:59,034 --> 01:10:00,827
Omar, this is the time
that I need your help.

1659
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:03,172
I know. That's why
I'm hustling for you.

1660
01:10:03,206 --> 01:10:05,758
- Help me.
- I am. I am.

1661
01:10:05,793 --> 01:10:07,275
<i>
I'm obviously</i> <i>
the biggest threat out here</i>

1662
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,758
<i>when it comes to physical,</i>

1663
01:10:08,793 --> 01:10:11,482
<i>and if I were them,</i> <i>
I would vote me out.</i>

1664
01:10:11,517 --> 01:10:12,758
<i>But I'm gonna keep</i>

1665
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:15,620
fighting in this game
'till I'm dead.

1666
01:10:15,655 --> 01:10:18,620
I'm voting for Maryanne,
and, uh,

1667
01:10:18,655 --> 01:10:20,310
stick with me.
I promise, I'm loyal.

1668
01:10:20,344 --> 01:10:22,965
<i>Well, if someone has to go,</i> <i>
then it's gonna be Maryanne.</i>

1669
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,931
<i>Here's the problem, though.</i> <i>
The fact</i>

1670
01:10:24,965 --> 01:10:27,793
that I have
to put my trust in people

1671
01:10:27,827 --> 01:10:30,586
<i>that I met a day</i> <i>
and a half ago is very scary.</i>

1672
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:34,103
<i>But we're supposed to be
an alliance of eight, and, uh,</i>

1673
01:10:34,137 --> 01:10:36,275
I am confident in Omar

1674
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,034
<i>keeping people off my back.</i>

1675
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:43,689
Yes. Yes.

1676
01:10:43,724 --> 01:10:45,310
Um...

1677
01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:51,413
But I did speak to Lindsay,
and she was saying, like,

1678
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:54,310
- Maryanne is, like, a huge liability.
- Oh.

1679
01:10:54,344 --> 01:10:55,620
So, it's, like, it's really
what does your gut say--

1680
01:10:55,655 --> 01:10:59,448
Jonathan versus Maryanne?

1681
01:10:59,482 --> 01:11:01,517
It feels like you're swayed
Jonathan over Maryanne.

1682
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:03,551
I just want to do majority.

1683
01:11:03,586 --> 01:11:06,655
<i>There is eight of us that want</i> <i>
to all work together, but</i>

1684
01:11:06,689 --> 01:11:08,551
<i>there is just this point</i> <i>
where I'm, like, "I just</i>

1685
01:11:08,586 --> 01:11:10,137
want to go with the numbers."

1686
01:11:10,172 --> 01:11:11,379
I don't want to be the one
on the bottom.

1687
01:11:11,413 --> 01:11:13,758
<i>And I kind of feel like</i>

1688
01:11:13,793 --> 01:11:15,241
we could be good.
We could be good,

1689
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:17,724
but this game changes so fast,
so, actually, who knows?

1690
01:11:17,758 --> 01:11:19,482
<i>I'm so worried. Like,
you can't prepare for anything.</i>

1691
01:11:19,517 --> 01:11:21,241
Okay.

1692
01:11:21,275 --> 01:11:23,310
Yeah.

1693
01:11:23,344 --> 01:11:24,413
<i>
Lydia says to me,</i>

1694
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:25,862
"Like, I'm really torn."

1695
01:11:25,896 --> 01:11:27,068
And I'm like,
"This is opportunity."

1696
01:11:27,103 --> 01:11:28,862
Like, you're telling me

1697
01:11:28,896 --> 01:11:30,689
<i>you don't know if you want</i> <i>
to stick with the eight.</i>

1698
01:11:30,724 --> 01:11:33,137
<i>And that's my opening to say,</i>

1699
01:11:33,172 --> 01:11:35,137
"Sacrifice little Lydia."

1700
01:11:35,172 --> 01:11:38,344
Thing is, now I feel
it's between Lydia and Maryanne.

1701
01:11:38,379 --> 01:11:40,034
- Positive?
- And then I think it's going to be something.

1702
01:11:40,068 --> 01:11:41,689
While it will be Jonathan
and not you.

1703
01:11:41,724 --> 01:11:44,862
I feel like you and Lindsay were
really on the Maryanne train,

1704
01:11:44,896 --> 01:11:47,379
- which I-I see, long-term.
- Mm-hmm.

1705
01:11:47,413 --> 01:11:49,689
But right now, it's too early,
and she's useful to us.

1706
01:11:49,724 --> 01:11:52,137
<i>
I'm trying to bring Taku</i> <i>
back together because,</i>

1707
01:11:52,172 --> 01:11:54,034
<i>at this point,</i> <i>
Maryanne has an extra vote</i>

1708
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:56,517
<i>and a hidden immunity idol,</i> <i>
and I don't want either one</i>

1709
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:58,517
<i>of those things</i> <i>
going out of the game</i>

1710
01:11:58,551 --> 01:12:00,482
because I'm gonna need weapons,
I'm gonna need arsenal,

1711
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:01,724
<i>and I'm gonna need an army.</i>

1712
01:12:01,758 --> 01:12:03,758
You were the primary at first,

1713
01:12:03,793 --> 01:12:05,137
but I'm trying
to shift it to Lydia.

1714
01:12:05,172 --> 01:12:07,103
- Why was I the primary?
- I don't know.

1715
01:12:07,137 --> 01:12:09,103
There's rumors
that you have an idol,

1716
01:12:09,137 --> 01:12:10,827
so I think
other tribes know about it.

1717
01:12:10,862 --> 01:12:13,241
- Okay, just be chill, okay? I need you to be chill.
- Okay. Yup.

1718
01:12:13,275 --> 01:12:14,793
- Because if you blow it...
- It's gone.

1719
01:12:14,827 --> 01:12:16,793
I'm shifting things to Lydia.

1720
01:12:16,827 --> 01:12:18,206
Okay,
so I write down Lydia's name?

1721
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:19,758
At Tribal, you need
to write down "Lydia."

1722
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:20,965
And if I'm not successful...

1723
01:12:22,344 --> 01:12:23,620
That's fine.

1724
01:12:23,655 --> 01:12:24,931
<i>My jaw just dropped.</i>

1725
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:26,620
<i>I was like, "Why me?"</i>

1726
01:12:26,655 --> 01:12:28,000
<i>Like, I don't want to go out</i> <i>
before the merge.</i>

1727
01:12:28,034 --> 01:12:30,103
<i>I've worked so hard</i> <i>
to be here, and</i>

1728
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:33,310
I'm so terrified. All I want
to do is cry and scream.

1729
01:12:33,344 --> 01:12:35,103
But, like,
I know that in this game,

1730
01:12:35,137 --> 01:12:36,551
I have to go, and I have

1731
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:39,137
<i>to center myself,</i> <i>
and I have to stay calm.</i>

1732
01:12:39,172 --> 01:12:40,896
<i>I feel as if me playing my idol</i>

1733
01:12:40,931 --> 01:12:44,413
right now--
it all comes down to Omar.

1734
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:46,724
The plan is obvious.
We need to switch to Lydia.

1735
01:12:46,758 --> 01:12:48,482
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

1736
01:12:49,655 --> 01:12:52,586
Yeah?

1737
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:54,310
<i>
In this game,</i>

1738
01:12:54,344 --> 01:12:56,206
<i>you take a little bit</i> <i>
of information, and that's</i>

1739
01:12:56,241 --> 01:12:58,482
where you weave in your own lies

1740
01:12:58,517 --> 01:13:01,379
<i>or your own truths</i> <i>
to prime them of the fact</i>

1741
01:13:01,413 --> 01:13:03,620
<i>that Lydia's maybe not</i> <i>
on their side, long-term.</i>

1742
01:13:03,655 --> 01:13:07,000
<i>But Lydia right now is Hai's</i> <i>
number-one ally in the game.</i>

1743
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:08,206
<i>This is one of</i>

1744
01:13:08,241 --> 01:13:10,034
the toughest jobs I've had
out here since I've started.

1745
01:13:10,068 --> 01:13:11,448
I didn't want
to upset the eight

1746
01:13:11,482 --> 01:13:13,172
- before it got to the point.
- Right. Right.

1747
01:13:13,206 --> 01:13:15,413
- So I didn't think it was my place to say it yet.
- Right.

1748
01:13:15,448 --> 01:13:17,344
But Lydia is like,
"At some point

1749
01:13:17,379 --> 01:13:19,793
within the eight, we need
to go after the bigger players."

1750
01:13:19,827 --> 01:13:23,689
I think Jonathan--
it's too early for him, but now,

1751
01:13:23,724 --> 01:13:25,379
it's, like,
Maryanne's the only one,

1752
01:13:25,413 --> 01:13:27,275
- and she has an immunity idol.
- Yup.

1753
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:29,413
If she plays that,
it's one of the eight.

1754
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:32,413
So, Lydia is the choice here.

1755
01:13:38,172 --> 01:13:39,586
But I want to make sure
all three of us are

1756
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,206
on board for the plan. Hai,

1757
01:13:41,241 --> 01:13:43,310
if that's what you think,
I'm with you.

1758
01:13:43,344 --> 01:13:45,206
<i>
Not an option at all.</i>

1759
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:47,965
<i>Lydia and I have been day ones</i> <i>
out here, and I gave her</i>

1760
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,275
<i>my word</i> <i>
that I would protect her.</i>

1761
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:50,655
<i>So now I have to</i>

1762
01:13:50,689 --> 01:13:53,310
scramble and get her
the numbers to stay.

1763
01:13:53,344 --> 01:13:55,241
Okay, and now I need to get
enough votes for Maryanne.

1764
01:13:55,275 --> 01:13:57,241
It's Jonathan and Maryanne.

1765
01:13:57,275 --> 01:13:58,965
<i>Tonight's tricky.</i> <i>
There seems to be</i>

1766
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
<i>a group who wants to target</i>

1767
01:14:01,034 --> 01:14:03,172
the more physical players,

1768
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:04,482
<i>such as Jonathan.</i> <i>
which I don't like,</i>

1769
01:14:04,517 --> 01:14:06,172
<i>'cause I consider myself</i>

1770
01:14:06,206 --> 01:14:07,724
one of the more physical
people here.

1771
01:14:07,758 --> 01:14:10,862
I want to win more
individual immunities, okay?

1772
01:14:10,896 --> 01:14:13,275
And I feel like
you would stand in my way.

1773
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:15,275
<i>
Which is why I need Maryanne</i> <i>
to go home tonight.</i>

1774
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,000
<i>However, the issue is,</i>

1775
01:14:17,034 --> 01:14:18,689
we know for a fact
that Maryanne has an idol.

1776
01:14:21,517 --> 01:14:23,896
Exactly, so we might be...
we might just slip by.

1777
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:25,724
<i>
In</i> Survivor,

1778
01:14:25,758 --> 01:14:28,034
your relationships
take precedent,

1779
01:14:28,068 --> 01:14:32,655
<i>and Lydia going home</i> <i>
will only hurt my game.</i>

1780
01:14:32,689 --> 01:14:35,275
<i>This game is wild.</i> <i>
Moments like these</i>

1781
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:36,517
<i>are where good players</i>

1782
01:14:36,551 --> 01:14:39,172
fold, and great players

1783
01:14:39,206 --> 01:14:40,344
<i>prevail.</i>

1784
01:15:05,655 --> 01:15:08,965
Wow. Everybody here.

1785
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,689
- First time.
- It's a good-looking bunch, huh?

1786
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:14,172
It really is. I was just kind of
taking everybody in, yeah.

1787
01:15:14,206 --> 01:15:17,689
And we love you, Mr. Jeff.

1788
01:15:17,724 --> 01:15:19,241
Mr. Jeff. Yeah, I'm getting used to that.
- Yeah.

1789
01:15:20,655 --> 01:15:21,896
All right. Hai,

1790
01:15:21,931 --> 01:15:23,517
how do you feel about this?
Is this

1791
01:15:23,551 --> 01:15:26,275
- a defining vote tonight?
- It is a defining vote,

1792
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,655
but things are a lot more fluid
this season.

1793
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:31,758
Tribal lines are typically
with your starting tribe.

1794
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,758
However, this season,
it's very fluid,

1795
01:15:34,793 --> 01:15:37,517
it's always moving,
and everyone's in conversation.

1796
01:15:37,551 --> 01:15:39,103
Everyone said,

1797
01:15:39,137 --> 01:15:42,241
"Let's go get firewood,"
but that firewood is empty.

1798
01:15:42,275 --> 01:15:44,482
I noticed that.

1799
01:15:47,068 --> 01:15:48,655
So Romeo, what do you base

1800
01:15:48,689 --> 01:15:50,241
trust on at this point

1801
01:15:50,275 --> 01:15:51,931
when you don't know
a lot of these people?

1802
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:54,862
I don't know about them, but for
me, it's always a gut feeling.

1803
01:15:54,896 --> 01:15:57,172
How are they interacting
with me?

1804
01:15:57,206 --> 01:15:58,758
Do they want
to start a conversation?

1805
01:15:58,793 --> 01:16:00,827
Or are they just starting
a nonsense conversation

1806
01:16:00,862 --> 01:16:02,137
just to say
that they talked to me?

1807
01:16:02,172 --> 01:16:04,068
I can look at somebody
in the eye

1808
01:16:04,103 --> 01:16:05,827
and know if they're telling me
the truth or not.

1809
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:08,310
Simple. That's just a gift
I've had since I was a child.

1810
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:09,689
Drea, it's interesting.

1811
01:16:09,724 --> 01:16:11,689
Romeo gave
a very specific situation

1812
01:16:11,724 --> 01:16:15,344
of somebody coming up and just
starting a BS conversation.

1813
01:16:15,379 --> 01:16:17,344
- Right.
- Do you feel like you can pick up those cues?

1814
01:16:17,379 --> 01:16:19,137
I'm very good at that,
but maybe

1815
01:16:19,172 --> 01:16:20,827
someone didn't come
to talk to you

1816
01:16:20,862 --> 01:16:22,862
because they didn't feel
comfortable coming to talk

1817
01:16:22,896 --> 01:16:24,241
to you or something like that.

1818
01:16:24,275 --> 01:16:25,931
So, I see both sides.

1819
01:16:25,965 --> 01:16:28,896
Hai, that's a very
sophisticated approach.

1820
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:30,724
You cannot just wait.

1821
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:32,655
Sometimes you have to stick
your hand out and say,

1822
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:34,310
"Want to talk?"

1823
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:36,068
Yeah, it's the idea of,
are you a driver

1824
01:16:36,103 --> 01:16:38,000
or are you a passenger?

1825
01:16:38,034 --> 01:16:41,068
You know, for me, growing up,

1826
01:16:41,103 --> 01:16:42,551
I didn't have a lot
of confidence,

1827
01:16:42,586 --> 01:16:44,034
and I knew coming out here,
I didn't want to be

1828
01:16:44,068 --> 01:16:45,586
that version of myself.

1829
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:48,068
I wanted to come out here
and play with confidence

1830
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,862
because if you come out here
and you play a fearful game,

1831
01:16:50,896 --> 01:16:52,413
you're not gonna get anywhere.

1832
01:16:52,448 --> 01:16:54,689
Lydia, I really connected

1833
01:16:54,724 --> 01:16:57,655
- with which version of yourself you want to show.
- Yeah.

1834
01:16:57,689 --> 01:16:59,827
When I was in high school,
we moved from Wichita, Kansas

1835
01:16:59,862 --> 01:17:01,310
to Seattle, Washington,

1836
01:17:01,344 --> 01:17:03,103
when I'm in the middle
of high school.

1837
01:17:03,137 --> 01:17:06,241
And I decided I'm going to put
a different version of myself

1838
01:17:06,275 --> 01:17:08,068
out in this new high school.

1839
01:17:08,103 --> 01:17:10,206
Have you had any of that yourself

1840
01:17:10,241 --> 01:17:12,137
out here in terms
of what parts

1841
01:17:12,172 --> 01:17:14,827
of me am I gonna put out
and what parts am I gonna hide?

1842
01:17:14,862 --> 01:17:16,896
Yeah. Growing up,

1843
01:17:16,931 --> 01:17:19,034
I-I faked a lot of confidence,
you know.

1844
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:21,275
And leaving my hometown
and just, like,

1845
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:24,275
gaining independence and just
accepting parts of myself

1846
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:25,827
that I never even realized.

1847
01:17:25,862 --> 01:17:28,137
You know, it... the confidence
actually became real.

1848
01:17:28,172 --> 01:17:30,137
And in <i>Survivor</i> specifically,

1849
01:17:30,172 --> 01:17:32,034
you're going
to just play better

1850
01:17:32,068 --> 01:17:33,482
and you're gonna feel better

1851
01:17:33,517 --> 01:17:35,103
if you are just
your full authentic self.

1852
01:17:36,689 --> 01:17:38,724
Jonathan, one of the things

1853
01:17:38,758 --> 01:17:43,379
you have to do in this game is
hide your paranoia or your fear.

1854
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:45,827
You know, the "never let 'em
see you sweat" thing.

1855
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:47,758
Does paranoia get to you?

1856
01:17:47,793 --> 01:17:49,310
There's a point in the game

1857
01:17:49,344 --> 01:17:51,413
where you've done
all that you can do.

1858
01:17:51,448 --> 01:17:54,448
And whoever
gets kicked out of here,

1859
01:17:54,482 --> 01:17:57,551
I hope that they go,
"I did everything I could do.

1860
01:17:57,586 --> 01:17:59,034
"When I had the opportunity
to be on <i>Survivor,</i>

1861
01:17:59,068 --> 01:18:00,896
I left it here."

1862
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:02,655
Omar, that would be

1863
01:18:02,689 --> 01:18:05,448
the best way to approach
every Tribal Council.

1864
01:18:05,482 --> 01:18:07,896
- Yeah.
- Can you do that?

1865
01:18:07,931 --> 01:18:09,793
Uh, my younger self would not
have been able to do that.

1866
01:18:09,827 --> 01:18:13,655
I think my older self--
now that I'm 30...

1867
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,172
Wow.

1868
01:18:15,206 --> 01:18:17,448
Let me just
take that statement in

1869
01:18:17,482 --> 01:18:20,517
- for a moment.
- Yeah. He don't know old, man.

1870
01:18:20,551 --> 01:18:23,344
Oh, that hurt.
I would say now

1871
01:18:23,379 --> 01:18:25,827
that I've had some
life experience, you can just

1872
01:18:25,862 --> 01:18:27,896
look at it factually, and
you know that at some point,

1873
01:18:27,931 --> 01:18:29,310
somebody's gonna come for you.

1874
01:18:29,344 --> 01:18:31,344
So I feel like
I can just tell people, like,

1875
01:18:31,379 --> 01:18:33,379
I'm worried,
and not dwell on it.

1876
01:18:33,413 --> 01:18:35,172
Rocksroy,

1877
01:18:35,206 --> 01:18:37,310
- you came into this late.
- Yes.

1878
01:18:37,344 --> 01:18:39,551
Could you sense a direction
of why the vote

1879
01:18:39,586 --> 01:18:41,793
might be going the way
it's gonna go?

1880
01:18:41,827 --> 01:18:42,896
Yeah, it's a tough one because

1881
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:45,034
I'm coming in this
two days of not being here.

1882
01:18:45,068 --> 01:18:47,724
But one of the things I know
that I can rely on is

1883
01:18:47,758 --> 01:18:50,793
the bond that I've built
with my alliance.

1884
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:54,655
And then there's a part of me,
also, that feels pretty bad

1885
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:57,310
because it's, like, my decision
is ultimately is the reason why

1886
01:18:57,344 --> 01:19:00,034
one of these people
are going home tonight.

1887
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,793
Maryanne, what do you
think the theme

1888
01:19:01,827 --> 01:19:03,344
of the vote is tonight?

1889
01:19:03,379 --> 01:19:06,379
Who can I continue
to work with and

1890
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:09,862
who do I want to work with
for a long span of time?

1891
01:19:09,896 --> 01:19:11,931
Drea, you agree with that?

1892
01:19:11,965 --> 01:19:14,379
- No, I don't agree with that.
- Okay, that's fine.

1893
01:19:14,413 --> 01:19:17,103
'Cause tomorrow,
someone could be gunning for me,

1894
01:19:17,137 --> 01:19:19,172
and then I might have to depend
on someone else to save me.

1895
01:19:19,206 --> 01:19:21,206
So, yeah, it's always changing.

1896
01:19:21,241 --> 01:19:22,793
But you choose your vote
because you think

1897
01:19:22,827 --> 01:19:24,275
that person's going
to work with you.

1898
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:26,068
But if they change their mind,
then of course,

1899
01:19:26,103 --> 01:19:27,517
you're not going
to work with them.

1900
01:19:27,551 --> 01:19:29,103
So then, I feel as if
we're on the same page,

1901
01:19:29,137 --> 01:19:30,896
different part of the line.

1902
01:19:30,931 --> 01:19:32,172
- Yeah?
- So you agree with me?

1903
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:34,931
- And you agree with me?
- No, I agree that

1904
01:19:34,965 --> 01:19:37,000
this doesn't mean that
this could take you long-term.

1905
01:19:37,034 --> 01:19:39,965
- It's <i>Survivor.</i> Yeah.
- Exactly. We're on the same page, I think.

1906
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,448
Not really. Agree to disagree.

1907
01:19:42,482 --> 01:19:45,344
And I respect that.
So Maryanne,

1908
01:19:45,379 --> 01:19:49,241
for all the charm,
do you worry talking too much

1909
01:19:49,275 --> 01:19:51,448
or debating too much
could be a reason

1910
01:19:51,482 --> 01:19:52,965
where the group just says,
"You know what?

1911
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,448
"I just... I need
to get some sleep.

1912
01:19:54,482 --> 01:19:55,586
Let's just vote Maryanne out"?

1913
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,793
Obviously,
I do worry about that.

1914
01:19:57,827 --> 01:20:00,275
But the thing about <i>Survivor</i>
is I can show

1915
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:02,724
my true self, and, like,
that means not be subdued.

1916
01:20:02,758 --> 01:20:04,448
That means that, like,
if I have a weird thing

1917
01:20:04,482 --> 01:20:06,344
which I want to say,
I want to say it. Like,

1918
01:20:06,379 --> 01:20:08,758
I wanted people
to know me for who I am.

1919
01:20:08,793 --> 01:20:09,931
Like, everyone in this tribe

1920
01:20:09,965 --> 01:20:11,379
has great qualities,
and everyone

1921
01:20:11,413 --> 01:20:13,137
in this tribe has things
that they want to work on.

1922
01:20:13,172 --> 01:20:15,000
Some of these things
might be obvious

1923
01:20:15,034 --> 01:20:16,724
to everybody,
some of these things might be

1924
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:18,551
less obvious to everybody.

1925
01:20:18,586 --> 01:20:20,310
Mine are obviously more obvious
to everyone, 'cause I'm just

1926
01:20:20,344 --> 01:20:22,551
like a "Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah." But, like,

1927
01:20:22,586 --> 01:20:24,862
I knew that coming into the...
What was your question?

1928
01:20:28,034 --> 01:20:29,586
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
What is that?

1929
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:30,724
It's, like, a beetle
or something.

1930
01:20:30,758 --> 01:20:33,034
- Or a rat.
- It's just a beetle.

1931
01:20:33,068 --> 01:20:34,206
- He's on me.
- Big-ass beetle.

1932
01:20:34,241 --> 01:20:37,586
- Look. He's right here.
- No! Aah! Ooh!

1933
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:38,724
Oh, my God.
We're in his neighborhood.

1934
01:20:38,758 --> 01:20:40,206
No, I know. It's all good.

1935
01:20:40,241 --> 01:20:41,724
It's all good. I'm fine with it.

1936
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:43,344
Oh, you actually
do have one there.

1937
01:20:43,379 --> 01:20:44,413
- Yeah, he literally does. It's there.
- Oh, that's cool.

1938
01:20:44,448 --> 01:20:46,241
Exactly.
Just a beetle.

1939
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:51,137
So Chanelle, are you
better off on <i>Survivor</i>

1940
01:20:51,172 --> 01:20:54,000
to try to quiet your quirks?

1941
01:20:54,034 --> 01:20:57,206
Or, as Maryanne is,
just embrace who you are?

1942
01:20:57,241 --> 01:20:59,034
That's what this game

1943
01:20:59,068 --> 01:21:00,551
is supposed
to bring out of you--

1944
01:21:00,586 --> 01:21:01,965
the fullest version
of yourself

1945
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,068
where you are meeting
your highest potential.

1946
01:21:04,103 --> 01:21:05,551
And if you're not authentic,

1947
01:21:05,586 --> 01:21:06,896
people will
see right through that.

1948
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:08,620
Jeff, there are

1949
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,482
12 realities here,

1950
01:21:10,517 --> 01:21:11,827
and each one of us have
a different perception

1951
01:21:11,862 --> 01:21:14,793
of every single other person.

1952
01:21:14,827 --> 01:21:17,655
So even if you think
someone's telling you the truth,

1953
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:22,379
it could be a lie, so,
lies will be revealed tonight.

1954
01:21:22,413 --> 01:21:24,206
All right,

1955
01:21:24,241 --> 01:21:26,965
it is time to vote.
Omar, you're up.

1956
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:50,689
That worked.

1957
01:21:55,758 --> 01:21:58,482
This is the biggest risk
I've ever made in my life.

1958
01:22:22,172 --> 01:22:24,517
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol

1959
01:22:24,551 --> 01:22:27,172
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

1960
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,551
Okay, I'll read the votes.

1961
01:22:41,551 --> 01:22:43,551
First vote:

1962
01:22:43,586 --> 01:22:46,034
Jonathan.

1963
01:22:48,206 --> 01:22:50,172
Lindsay. One vote, Jonathan.
One vote, Lindsay.

1964
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:55,137
Jonathan. Two votes, Jonathan,
One vote, Lindsay.

1965
01:22:56,517 --> 01:22:59,551
Maryanne. Two votes, Jonathan.
One vote, Lindsay,

1966
01:22:59,586 --> 01:23:01,034
One vote, Maryanne.

1967
01:23:02,758 --> 01:23:05,275
Maryanne. We're tied.
Two votes, Maryanne.

1968
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:08,137
Two votes, Jonathan.
One vote, Lindsay.

1969
01:23:10,482 --> 01:23:13,551
Lydia.
That's two votes, Maryanne,

1970
01:23:13,586 --> 01:23:14,931
two votes, Jonathan,
one vote, Lindsay,

1971
01:23:14,965 --> 01:23:17,137
one vote, Lydia.

1972
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,551
Lydia. We're tied again.
Lydia: two votes,

1973
01:23:22,586 --> 01:23:24,068
Maryanne: two votes,

1974
01:23:24,103 --> 01:23:25,379
Jonathan: two votes,
Lindsay: one vote.

1975
01:23:27,551 --> 01:23:30,965
Lydia. That's three votes, Lydia,

1976
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,241
two votes, Maryanne,
two votes, Jonathan,

1977
01:23:32,275 --> 01:23:34,241
one vote, Lindsay.

1978
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:40,206
Lydia. That's four votes,
Lydia, two votes, Maryanne,

1979
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:43,379
two votes, Jonathan,
one vote, Lindsay.

1980
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:48,206
Seventh person voted out
of <i>Survivor 42:</i>

1981
01:23:48,241 --> 01:23:50,034
Lydia. That's five. That's
enough. You need to bring me

1982
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:52,413
your torch.

1983
01:24:02,793 --> 01:24:04,000
Love you, Lyds.

1984
01:24:05,758 --> 01:24:08,655
Lydia, the tribe has spoken.

1985
01:24:09,655 --> 01:24:11,793
Time to go.

1986
01:24:11,827 --> 01:24:13,206
Good luck, guys.

1987
01:24:13,241 --> 01:24:14,862
Bye, Lydia.

1988
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:24,965
Congratulations. You are now...

1989
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,586
- Oh, my God. ...officially merged.
- Yeah!

1990
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:30,448
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp. Good night.

1991
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:31,689
Thanks, Jeff.

1992
01:24:59,172 --> 01:25:01,034
<i>
Someone is creating chaos.</i>

1993
01:25:01,068 --> 01:25:02,068
I don't like that.

1994
01:25:04,862 --> 01:25:06,137
<i>They were like rats.</i>

1995
01:25:06,172 --> 01:25:07,551
And when you turn on the lights,
and they scurry away.

1996
01:25:07,586 --> 01:25:09,000
Yeah.

1997
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:10,965
I'm not closing any doors
right now.

1998
01:25:13,413 --> 01:25:14,482
<i>
If they got to go,</i>

1999
01:25:14,517 --> 01:25:15,965
they got to go.

2000
01:25:19,379 --> 01:25:21,137
I got blindsided

2001
01:25:21,172 --> 01:25:24,379
<i>and to be so close</i> <i>
to the merge--</i>

2002
01:25:24,413 --> 01:25:28,137
<i>it sucks, for sure, but as much
as I wanted to make it further,</i>

2003
01:25:28,172 --> 01:25:32,586
<i>I learned a lot about myself,
