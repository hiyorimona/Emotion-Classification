1
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:10,137
<i>
I just want to say</i>

2
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:11,931
I have no hard feelings.
This is a game.

3
00:00:11,965 --> 00:00:13,482
I'm glad I'm still here.

4
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:15,000
- Good job, Romeo.
- Thank you for keeping me,

5
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:16,310
and I still like all of you.

6
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:17,793
<i>At Tribal,</i>

7
00:00:17,827 --> 00:00:19,413
three votes were thrown on me

8
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:22,034
just in case
Chanelle played an idol.

9
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:25,758
So, obviously, I was lied to.

10
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:29,034
<i>All these people are fake.</i> <i>
I don't like any of 'em, so</i>

11
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:31,103
<i>I have</i> <i>
to put on a fake happy smile</i>

12
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:33,000
<i>and pretend</i> <i>
that it's all good.</i>

13
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,413
"It's all good
if you voted for me."

14
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:37,068
You know, when in reality
I want to, like,

15
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,965
kick 'em in the face.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,758
<i>But that's not smart.</i>

17
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:42,310
What?

18
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:43,862
What's up?

19
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:45,172
No, I have no idea
who that is.

20
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:47,172
- I thought so, baby. I-I got it.
- No, I voted for Chanelle.

21
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:50,275
- I-I know who it is. Thank you.
- Okay.

22
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,206
<i>
I have not received
a single vote until this Tribal.</i>

23
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:57,034
And then, all of a sudden,
I receive a hinky vote, which...

24
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:59,034
Whatever. It's fine.

25
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:02,896
<i>But now I'm kind of,</i> <i>
like, upset about it,</i>

26
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:05,862
and I have an inkling
that it came from Romeo.

27
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:08,655
He, you know, swore
that he's a God-fearing man,

28
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,068
he wouldn't write my name down, and...

29
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,034
Hai...
- ...there it was.

30
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:15,482
So if you didn't vote for me,
who voted for me?

31
00:01:15,517 --> 00:01:17,241
I don't know. It wasn't me.
I voted for Chanelle.

32
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:21,379
Even if this is my last vote,
I just want to see you squirm.

33
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:24,275
Does anyone want
to admit to my name?

34
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:29,206
Right. It-it was Romeo.

35
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:32,482
<i>
Hai is the person who's</i> <i>
instigating everything on camp.</i>

36
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:35,931
<i>And people are too dumb</i> <i>
to realize it.</i>

37
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:38,724
And so I threw a vote
his direction

38
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:41,034
because even though I knew
he wasn't going home,

39
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,448
<i>I knew</i> <i>
that it would make him squirm.</i>

40
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,137
<i>I wanted him to freak out,</i> <i>
and I was successful</i>

41
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:54,137
because now people see
that this man is not all there,

42
00:01:54,172 --> 00:02:00,206
and whoever is aligned
with him is... is... is dumb.

43
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:03,000
<i>If I get voted off next, fine,</i> <i>
but I'm not getting voted out</i>

44
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:05,862
<i>without trying</i> <i>
and creating a little chaos.</i>

45
00:02:05,896 --> 00:02:09,000
You have to play this game, and
- I'm-
- I'm going to play this game.

46
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:15,379
<i>
Hey.</i>

47
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:20,896
Okay. Okay, but...

48
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:25,000
- Well, you asked my opinion. Can I finish?
- Yes. Go.

49
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,000
Not only
is he creating paranoia.

50
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,000
He can look me in the eye and

51
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:33,206
straight-up lie to me.
That's personal.

52
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:36,517
I mean, yes,
Romeo is an easy gone,

53
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:38,172
but I'm nervous about me.

54
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:42,206
<i>I've been busting my ass
out here, and it's not just me.</i>

55
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,379
Jonathan is out there, you know,
first thing, "Let's go fishing."

56
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:45,827
Mike, same thing.

57
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:49,034
<i>"Let's go get firewood,"</i> <i>
but no one cares.</i>

58
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,551
<i>Instead,</i> <i>
it's put a target on us.</i>

59
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:53,344
<i>So I need to do something.</i>

60
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,896
The guys need
to stick together.

61
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,206
Say it, dude.

62
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,034
We have more dudes
than women here.

63
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:02,344
And right now we have
the freaking numbers, guys.

64
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:04,172
I don't want to get taken out
and then, guess what,

65
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:05,862
- they're gonna start picking off...
- Us one at a time.

66
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:07,137
- ...buh-buh, buh-buh, buh-buh.
- Yup.
- You go first.

67
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:08,517
- You're going second.
- Second, yeah.

68
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:10,137
- Guess who's going third. Boom.
- Third.

69
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:11,344
<i>-
<i>I want to talk to Omar...</i> <i>
Yeah.</i>

70
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,310
<i>...and talk to Hai.</i>

71
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:14,758
<i>Rocksroy wants</i> <i>
to make an alliance</i>

72
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:17,172
<i>with the five guys</i> <i>
so that we have</i>

73
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:18,896
some pull in the game

74
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:21,172
because everybody's always
after the big guy in <i>Survivor.</i>

75
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:23,068
<i>So I'm very interested.</i>

76
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,517
- I'm in, bro. I'm serious. Listen, I'm in.
- I'm in. I'm in.

77
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:27,482
- You know I'm in.
- Yup.

78
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:29,517
<i>
The guys are coming together,</i>

79
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:32,068
<i>'cause normally guys like me</i> <i>
and Jonathan are taken out,</i>

80
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:34,068
<i>so I would love</i> <i>
a male alliance.</i>

81
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:35,034
<i>I know sooner or later</i>

82
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:36,689
we're gonna
cannibalize each other

83
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:38,655
and eat each other and leave
the-the dead bodies on the road.

84
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,034
I know that's gonna happen.

85
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:41,344
<i>But the guys</i> <i>
that I'm with right now--</i>

86
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:44,000
<i>they deserve to go forward.</i>

87
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:45,724
So, how many guys
are there right now?

88
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,344
- Every single <i>Survivor,</i> the guys don't get together.
- Yeah, yeah.

89
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,034
- I'm not trying to lead anything...
- Yeah.

90
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,068
...but if we stuck together...

91
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,586
<i>Rocksroy's like,</i> <i>
"Listen up, buddy.</i>

92
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,862
"How many guys are there?
Hint, hint.

93
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:05,724
"Like, um, guys' alliance,
like, so obvious?

94
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,896
<i>I don't know why nobody's</i> <i>
done this in 40 seasons."</i>

95
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,034
<i>I'm like,</i> <i>
"Are you insane, Rocksroy?</i>

96
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:11,724
"You haven't talked to me
the whole time about game,

97
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:13,000
and you're going to come in hot
like that."

98
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:15,034
Like, that seems like a mistake.

99
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:18,413
Yup. Yup.

100
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:20,068
Yeah, yeah, I love it.

101
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:22,000
<i>You're telling me that</i>

102
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:26,172
<i>I'm gonna have as equal
of a chance as Jonathan and Mike</i>

103
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:28,000
at winning immunity

104
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,862
<i>at the final five?</i> <i>
Like, are you insane?</i>

105
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,034
<i>
There seems to be</i> <i>
a boys' alliance brewing,</i>

106
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:46,689
<i>and I somehow became a part</i> <i>
of it.</i>

107
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:49,068
And I don't know
where they got the idea

108
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:51,413
that I would vote
with all the boys.

109
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:54,551
Like, I'm not part
of the misogyny club here.

110
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:02,862
<i>The way that Rocksroy talks</i> <i>
to people makes me upset.</i>

111
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:05,172
He's very blunt,
he cuts people off.

112
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:06,724
<i>He doesn't let you finish</i> <i>
your thoughts.</i>

113
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:09,034
<i>And you only talk strategy</i> <i>
with Rocksroy</i>

114
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,034
when Rocksroy wants
to talk strategy.

115
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:12,413
<i>And I hate it.</i>

116
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:15,758
<i>So he's quickly</i> <i>
making his way up the ranks</i>

117
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,689
<i>on my list</i> <i>
of people to vote out.</i>

118
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:39,206
All right, ready to get
to today's immunity challenge?

119
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:40,758
First things first.

120
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:42,034
Tori, for the second time
in a row,

121
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:44,413
got to take it back.

122
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,206
Thank you.

123
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:51,862
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

124
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:54,034
<i>For today's challenge,</i> <i>
you're going to balance</i>

125
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:56,758
<i>on a triangular platform</i> <i>
in rough water</i>

126
00:05:56,793 --> 00:06:00,931
<i>with your feet perched</i> <i>
on very narrow footholds.</i>

127
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,724
<i>At regular intervals,</i> <i>
we'll move higher,</i>

128
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:04,000
<i>making it more difficult.</i>

129
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:07,034
<i>If, at any point,</i> <i>
you touch the platform</i>

130
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:11,310
<i>or fall off... you're out.</i>

131
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:14,034
Today, not just one person
will win immunity.

132
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:17,241
- Two people...
- Wow.

133
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,586
- Yes.
- ...will win immunity.

134
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,000
- We are dividing you into two teams of five.
- Oh, my gosh.

135
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:24,344
Wow.

136
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,172
One person from each team
will win immunity.

137
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:28,862
Both teams will go
to Tribal Council separately.

138
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:30,689
Both teams will vote
somebody out.

139
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:34,724
So two people
will have immunity.

140
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:36,172
Two people going home tonight.

141
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:40,758
In addition, the person
who lasts the longest

142
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:43,862
of the entire challenge earns
for their team

143
00:06:43,896 --> 00:06:45,344
beef and veggie kebabs

144
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,068
- to take back to camp.
- Oh.

145
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:48,689
- Cook 'em up yourself.
- Whoa.

146
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:51,034
Plus, that team will go
to Tribal Council

147
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:53,724
last, which means you'll have
an additional advantage

148
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:55,310
of knowing who was voted out

149
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:57,137
- in the first Tribal Council.
- Wow.

150
00:06:57,172 --> 00:07:00,517
- Wow.
- All right, we'll get started. Here we go.

151
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,379
All right,
we have our two teams.

152
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:15,862
In blue-- Drea, Jonathan,
Tori, Lindsay and Maryanne.

153
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:19,137
Running orange,
we have Mike, Rocksroy,

154
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,172
Omar, Romeo and Hai.

155
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:26,034
The sea is very rough,
the wind is picking up.

156
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,068
This could be over very fast.

157
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:31,758
Your life in the game
hangs in the balance.

158
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:35,034
Here we go.
I'm gonna count you in.

159
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:37,896
Everybody get up off your butt.

160
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:41,517
Five, four,

161
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:44,896
three, two, one.

162
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,068
This challenge is on.
You're getting your balance.

163
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,206
Everybody's good. Maryanne is in.

164
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,482
She's first out. Rocksroy's out.

165
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:54,000
Omar's out. Mike's out.

166
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:56,206
Just like that, four are out.

167
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,000
We're down to Hai and Romeo

168
00:07:58,034 --> 00:07:59,827
fighting for immunity
for orange.

169
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:02,413
Hang in there, Romeo!
Find that balance point.

170
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,896
It is a very rough day
on the water

171
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:06,172
- here in Fiji.
- I'm out.

172
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:08,310
Drea's out.
This is going so fast.

173
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:09,655
Tori's out.

174
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,172
Now it is Lindsay
and Jonathan

175
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:14,724
fighting for immunity for blue.

176
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:16,862
Not even a minute yet.

177
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,551
Unprecedented swells

178
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:22,517
and wind on an already
difficult challenge.

179
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,655
Romeo, you touched. You're out.

180
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,034
Hai, you're good,
but keep fighting.

181
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,068
Hai has immunity.

182
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:35,758
You want to stay in it now. Remember,

183
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:37,448
the last person standing
also wins food.

184
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:42,896
Lindsay and Jonathan fighting
for immunity and food.

185
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,000
Keep fighting, Hai!

186
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:47,000
Lindsay, stay in it!

187
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:50,482
Jonathan hunched over.

188
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,827
You've been out there
only two minutes.

189
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:54,931
Good job, Hai!

190
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:57,137
Your life in the game is
on the line right now.

191
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,344
Keep fighting.

192
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:02,827
Lindsay With a nice recovery.

193
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:04,448
Hai with a nice recovery.

194
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:11,068
Jonathan with a nice recovery.

195
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:17,172
Lindsay with another nice save.

196
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:18,068
Great balance.

197
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,034
That's how you do it!

198
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:27,034
You want to make the final
eight, you win right here,

199
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,413
and you've done it.

200
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,034
Hai is already in eight.

201
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:32,068
Who will join him?

202
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:34,034
Hai is now fighting
for food for his team.

203
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,551
Hai, stay in it.

204
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:37,034
Hai,

205
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:39,000
- nice recovery!
- Yeah, Hai!

206
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:43,068
The wind continues to move

207
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:46,379
bodies and platforms
all over the place.

208
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:49,551
Very difficult to do
this challenge on a flat sea.

209
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:01,344
Whoa!

210
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:03,758
Lindsay can't do it.
Lindsay's out.

211
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:06,758
Now it's Jonathan
who has won immunity,

212
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:09,931
and we have a showdown--
Hai and Jonathan.

213
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:20,413
Hai's out. Jonathan wins
immunity and food for his team.

214
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:23,758
Wow!

215
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,000
Great job, Hai.

216
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:27,413
Amazing effort by everybody in

217
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:29,241
a very difficult challenge.

218
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:35,310
All right, two winners.

219
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,896
Hai, come on over.

220
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:38,172
Yeah, Hai!

221
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:40,034
Come on, Hai.

222
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:42,689
Yeah!
My man.

223
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:44,206
And it looks good on you, bro.

224
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:46,034
You are safe, cannot
be voted out tonight.

225
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:48,034
Head back to orange.

226
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:50,034
- Yeah!
- Jonathan, come on over.

227
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:53,241
Yeah, Jonathan, swag, swag!

228
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,241
Oh, yeah!
- You've been waiting for this.

229
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:58,034
I've been waiting.
Come on, Mr. Jeff.

230
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,551
Yeah!

231
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:02,482
Jonathan also safe tonight
at Tribal Council,

232
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:04,724
guaranteed a spot
in the final eight.

233
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:06,655
Head back over. In addition...

234
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:08,482
- I'm proud of you.
- Jonathan earned

235
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,310
- for his team of five...
- Thank you.

236
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:14,068
kebabs waiting for you
back at camp, you can cook up

237
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:16,241
while you go back
to the old Taku camp,

238
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,034
where you will spend
the afternoon.

239
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,517
You will go
to Tribal Council first.

240
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:21,206
Then you'll go
to Tribal Council second,

241
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,896
and you will
have the advantage

242
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,137
of seeing what just happened.

243
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:26,206
Big night.
Two people going home.

244
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:28,379
I'll see everybody at Tribal Council.
Thank you.

245
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:30,379
<i>
Hai got the immunity necklace.</i>

246
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:32,689
I don't have to even worry
about anything today.

247
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:35,034
<i>I got me, Omar and Rocks,</i> <i>
and Romeo is out.</i>

248
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,034
<i>That's easy.</i> <i>
We got the numbers.</i>

249
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,448
Four to one, we go home.

250
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:51,827
This is your camp, huh?

251
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:53,034
This isn't that bad.

252
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:55,000
- It's kind of cute.
- Oh, it got old

253
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:56,827
- after a while.
- Huh?

254
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:59,137
<i>
I never thought I would</i> <i>
ever come back to Taku,</i>

255
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:04,000
<i>but here I am with Hai,</i> <i>
Rocksroy, Romeo and Mike.</i>

256
00:12:04,034 --> 00:12:06,206
Wow.
Wow. They really separated our group

257
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:08,103
so there's no discussion. Yeah.

258
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:10,103
<i>
And what's interesting about</i>

259
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:12,103
this configuration is,
Rocksroy boy,

260
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:14,034
you got your final five
of men.

261
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,172
<i>But who's gonna be</i> <i>
the one out now?</i>

262
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:18,965
So we probably have about

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,896
three to four hours. Yeah?
Yup.

264
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:22,517
Sure.
- Uh, food-wise,

265
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,034
- you want to take a look?
- Yeah, sure, let's go.

266
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,068
Yeah, let's go.

267
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:26,448
<i>
This is my worst nightmare.</i>

268
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:28,103
<i>I mean, I never had anything</i>

269
00:12:28,137 --> 00:12:30,586
<i>in common with Rocksroy,</i> <i>
even though we were aligned.</i>

270
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,206
<i>I have nothing in common</i> <i>
with Mike.</i>

271
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:34,827
<i>He's like a hundred years old.</i>

272
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:38,137
<i>And Hai-- we got into</i> <i>
an argument last night, so,</i>

273
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:40,034
I'm going home.
There's no questions about it.

274
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:41,758
There's nothing really
that I can do.

275
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:44,620
Think it's kind of
a no-brainer, but...

276
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:46,482
Dude, nobody's
getting squirrely,

277
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,655
- so I think it's...
- Yeah.

278
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:51,103
<i>
Fortunately,</i> <i>
I have three of the guys</i>

279
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,137
<i>that I brought together waiting</i>

280
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,965
<i>to go to Tribal right now.</i>

281
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,206
Now, during the wait,
is where the dynamics come in.

282
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,034
You ask anybody that's been
with me since the beginning,

283
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:02,896
- what I say, I mean.
- I'm not voting for you tonight, so...

284
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:04,137
And I'm not
voting for you tonight.

285
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:05,379
<i>
I think, personally,</i>

286
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:07,000
when it comes to guys,

287
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:10,965
<i>guys are more rigid</i> <i>
in making a decision,</i>

288
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,275
so I'm banking on that.

289
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,931
<i>
Going into tonight,</i>

290
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:23,379
<i>Romeo was a dead man walking,</i>

291
00:13:23,413 --> 00:13:25,241
<i>but in the long term,</i>

292
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:28,896
he's loyal to me right now,
whereas Rocksroy--

293
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:31,896
<i>I feel like there's less room</i> <i>
to maneuver with him.</i>

294
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:34,137
<i>He's immovable, he's unshakable.</i>

295
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:36,931
I'm trying to eliminate people
at this stage of the game that

296
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:39,586
<i>I can't shape or mold</i> <i>
to what I want.</i>

297
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,655
And so, they are coming
for you tonight.

298
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,724
I need to talk to Hai
to confirm the plan,

299
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,103
but I think
we should go for Rocks.

300
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:57,965
Hai will be the swing vote tonight.

301
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,448
Yeah, but the problem is,
I don't trust him.

302
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:01,137
He wants me out.

303
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,034
I know you're feeling that way,
but you have to trust me.

304
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:05,034
So just be
as calm as possible.

305
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:06,620
<i>
The irony is,</i>

306
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:10,827
<i>the person that I wanted to</i> <i>
vote out tonight is the person</i>

307
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:15,068
my <i>Survivor</i> life depends on
at tonight's Tribal Council.

308
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:17,275
<i>It's terrifying.</i>

309
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,241
I'm going to have to trust the
one person that I don't trust.

310
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,137
I know.

311
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:24,068
<i>
Let's just say</i> <i>
I'm not too confident because</i>

312
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:28,000
Hai is the sneakiest...

313
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:32,103
weasel that <i>Survivor 42</i> has.

314
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,103
I feel like you might be
on the same page

315
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:36,620
with me about Rocks. Yes.

316
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:39,413
- He's getting exceedingly difficult to work with.
- Yes.

317
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:42,137
If we wanted to blindside Rocks,

318
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:46,034
- I would be with you a thousand percent.
- Tonight?

319
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,827
- Here's the concern.
- Yeah.

320
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:51,310
Mike still considers me his number one.
- Right, right.

321
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:52,931
If we vote Rocks tonight,

322
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:55,137
and I don't tell Mike,

323
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:57,724
- I lose his trust forever.
- Right.

324
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:59,206
<i>
Tonight's vote could be</i> <i>
very simple.</i>

325
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:01,172
If I wanted
to make an emotional move,

326
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:03,241
I would take out Romeo.

327
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:04,413
But for me,

328
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,137
<i>tonight's vote is not emotional.</i>

329
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:09,241
<i>It's strategic.</i> <i>
But I don't want</i>

330
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,931
to make this move
without Mike's blessing

331
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:13,137
because I don't want
to lose Mike's trust.

332
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,241
<i>Can I be candid with you?</i>

333
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:16,551
<i>
Yeah. Course you could.</i>

334
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:18,551
Here's my thought.

335
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:21,034
<i>Obviously Romeo's</i> <i>
very untrustworthy.</i>

336
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:24,206
<i>I know he's coming after me,</i> <i>
but I'm not scared of Romeo.</i>

337
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:26,793
<i>Rocksroy, down the line,</i> <i>
is gonna be hard to navigate,</i>

338
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,241
<i>especially</i> <i>
as the numbers dwindle.</i>

339
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,655
We can't take him out tonight.

340
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,655
- You don't want to?
- No, I'm not saying... No.

341
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:35,275
I do want to, but we can't,
because if we take him out,

342
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,758
it'll show that we're
not trustworthy,

343
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:39,551
that we would turn
on our alliance.

344
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,103
<i>Voting Rocksroy</i>

345
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:42,965
tarnishes what I say out here.

346
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,241
I'm a man of my word.

347
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,310
<i>What happens if we do</i> <i>
vote Rocksroy out tonight?</i>

348
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,103
<i>Does the rest of our alliance</i> <i>
look at us and say,</i>

349
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:50,241
<i>"You're not trustworthy.</i> <i>
We could be next"?</i>

350
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,862
That's what I think about,
and my word is big here.

351
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:59,103
Listen, they're gonna say,
"If they turned against Rocksroy

352
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:01,551
when they promised him,
they'll turn on me."

353
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,551
<i>Here's the truth,</i>

354
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,724
Rocksroy's not
a hard vote for me,

355
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:06,931
<i>but I gave him my word already.</i>

356
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:09,206
<i>So Hai is putting me</i> <i>
in a bad position.</i>

357
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:10,551
Hai is my number one here.

358
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,620
Me and Hai have been together
since day three.

359
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:15,310
<i>So we got to figure out</i> <i>
what we're gonna do.</i>

360
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:27,241
Look at all the food.

361
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:28,758
Holy cow.

362
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:30,379
Mmm. That's so good.
Oh, my gosh.

363
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:31,827
- Oh, my God.
- And tomato.

364
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:34,793
<i>
I was so close</i> <i>
to beating Jonathan</i>

365
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,206
<i>at that immunity challenge.</i>

366
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:38,206
But at least
we won a bunch of food,

367
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:39,241
which was super exciting.

368
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:41,206
<i>And I'm happy with the way</i> <i>
we got divvied up,</i>

369
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,206
<i>because it's me</i> <i>
and two other Takus.</i>

370
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,413
<i>So we're in control of</i> <i>
who's going home tonight.</i>

371
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:47,137
<i>Drea has a hidden immunity idol,</i>

372
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,275
<i>so it kind of seems like Tori</i> <i>
might be the easy target here.</i>

373
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:54,655
I know.

374
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,310
Like, I, like, I think Romeo.

375
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:59,241
I mean, after that whole scuffle.
- Yeah.

376
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:01,275
<i>
When we got split</i> <i>
into two different groups,</i>

377
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,310
<i>I realized this could be</i> <i>
really good for me.</i>

378
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:06,310
<i>From the beginning,</i>

379
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:11,206
I've had to put any ego
that I've had behind me,

380
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:15,034
<i>because the big guy</i> <i>
cannot come in guns a-blazing,</i>

381
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,931
"This is how it's gonna be."

382
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:19,137
Because it puts an even
bigger target on your back.

383
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:23,034
<i>So I've been waiting for</i> <i>
my moment to make a big move.</i>

384
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:25,103
And now is that time.

385
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,241
<i>-
So, listen.</i> <i>
Yeah.</i>

386
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,137
We're gonna
get rid of this idol.

387
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,655
Okay? Not yours.

388
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,310
- Drea's. I was thinking that.
- Right.

389
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,931
- So, listen... So, keep...
- Okay. Yeah.

390
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:38,517
<i>
Yeah.</i>

391
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:40,586
<i>
Yeah.</i>

392
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,758
And we're gonna tell Drea
it's you.

393
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:46,310
If this works,
then we're golden.

394
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:48,000
This is how we have to do it.

395
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:51,103
<i>Jonathan is like,</i> <i>
"Look, we need to get Drea.</i>

396
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,448
Drea has an idol.
She needs to go."

397
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:55,655
And I'm like,
"Okay, cool. I'm on board."

398
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:58,000
<i>'Cause I've been on the outs</i> <i>
since the merge.</i>

399
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:01,310
<i>But then he says, "We're gonna</i> <i>
have Drea vote for you."</i>

400
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:03,413
<i>And I'm like, "What the heck?"</i>

401
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,724
- <i>-
- We can flush the idol.</i> <i>But, like...</i> <i> Okay.</i>

402
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:07,206
We need to do it now.
Do you understand?

403
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:09,034
<i>That is the plan.</i>

404
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:10,758
<i>Drea is going.</i>

405
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:12,310
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay?

406
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:15,068
<i>
Jonathan treats me</i> <i>
like a young little girl--</i>

407
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:16,620
<i>the child that needs to be led.</i>

408
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:18,620
<i>And that's so annoying,</i>

409
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:21,206
<i>because I'm not here</i> <i>
to be a sheep.</i>

410
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:23,068
<i>So I'm fine with targeting Drea,</i>

411
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,068
<i>but Jonathan's</i> <i>
really getting to me.</i>

412
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,275
<i>Yeah, but he said</i> <i>
I can't tell you,</i>

413
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,310
- so... he...
- Wait, he really did?

414
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,379
You don't know this.
You don't...

415
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:39,448
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

416
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:41,482
- Yeah.
- But here's the thing,

417
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:42,655
<i>I know Drea.</i>

418
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,448
<i>Drea has been wanting</i> <i>
to make a move on me.</i>

419
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:46,551
I know, and I know she's
gonna get in their heads.

420
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:48,137
The only thing is,
if they're gonna follow.

421
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:51,137
<i>After winning the first two</i> <i>
individual immunities,</i>

422
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,137
my biggest fear is that it's
gonna be like a no-brainer.

423
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:56,206
Oh, Tori doesn't have an idol.
She doesn't have an advantage.

424
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:57,655
<i>Let's just get her out now.</i>

425
00:18:57,689 --> 00:19:00,137
<i>But somehow they're finally</i> <i>
willing to make a move</i>

426
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,724
<i>and to make it on Drea.</i>

427
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:04,000
<i>And as long as</i> <i>
they stick with the plan,</i>

428
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:05,620
<i>I still have hope in this game.</i>

429
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:18,000
We can either do Maryanne,
which I'm fine with...

430
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:20,068
<i>
Do you want Maryanne out?</i>

431
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:22,103
<i>
I think that it'd be good</i> <i>
to get rid of the idol.</i>

432
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:23,137
I do, too.

433
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:24,482
Okay.

434
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:27,068
- <i>- You've got my word.</i> <i>
- Awesome. You got mine.</i>

435
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,931
<i>Getting split</i> <i>
into two tribes totally sucks,</i>

436
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:33,655
because none of these people
are really my close allies.

437
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:36,241
<i>But then Jonathan said,</i> <i>
"It's Maryanne."</i>

438
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,758
<i>Instantly, I was like,</i> <i>
"Okay, awesome."</i>

439
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:42,206
<i>However, that's, like,</i> <i>
a red flag for me</i>

440
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:45,000
<i>when I hear that they're voting</i> <i>
out people who have idols.</i>

441
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,655
'Cause I'm like,
"Uh... this girl has one, too."

442
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:56,379
<i>
So let me tell you,</i>

443
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:59,034
- if you could just hear me out, okay?
- Yeah. Mm.

444
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:01,586
<i>
We have an opportunity</i> <i>
to take out Drea.</i>

445
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,931
Okay.

446
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:04,793
So, yeah,
three of us are voting Drea,

447
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:07,034
<i>and she's voting Maryanne.</i>

448
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:08,724
- Okay. Okay.
- This could be a huge move for us,

449
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:10,931
because there's
only gonna be eight left,

450
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:12,758
and the Taku four
would still be here.

451
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:15,137
- And we have an extra vote and an idol.
- Uh-huh. Right. Yes.

452
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,137
So we can make it
to the top four

453
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,000
if we play our cards right.
You down?

454
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:22,586
- So, we get rid of Drea...
- Mm-hmm.

455
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,448
- ...to flush the idol out.
- Done.

456
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:28,137
<i>
But if she chooses to play it,</i> <i>
Maryanne would be out,</i>

457
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:30,241
<i>and we would lose</i> <i>
that extra vote and an idol.</i>

458
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:39,275
Let's think about that
for a second.

459
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,206
Jonathan is not very strategic.</i>

460
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,551
<i>But he's not thinking things</i> <i>
all the way through,</i>

461
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:45,827
because if Drea plays her idol,
Maryanne's gone.

462
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:47,310
So how are we gonna keep
the Taku four?

463
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:49,586
<i>And if he really</i> <i>
is trying to be Taku strong,</i>

464
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,068
<i>we need a contingency plan.</i>

465
00:20:51,103 --> 00:20:54,275
<i>I can convince Drea</i> <i>
to vote Tori,</i>

466
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,206
<i>because they already</i> <i>
hate each other.</i>

467
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:58,206
So me and Drea vote Tori,

468
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:01,275
and the three of you vote Drea.

469
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,241
<i>
So here's the thing.</i> <i>
Tori will tell Drea.</i>

470
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:04,275
<i>
No.</i>

471
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,448
- She could.
- Why?

472
00:21:05,482 --> 00:21:07,413
- Because Maryanne...
- She doesn't like Drea.

473
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:10,103
- She would not say it to Drea.
- Well, you don't, t-truly, you don't know that.

474
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:11,896
I know more than you know that.
But that's... and that's...

475
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:13,034
I'm giving you... And that's why
I'm having you trust me.

476
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:15,034
Like, trust me
that the information

477
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,137
- that I've been getting...
- We're not supposed to trust anybody out here.

478
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:20,137
Correct, but Tori knows
that she's been on the bottom.

479
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:21,310
I don't think
she would warn her,

480
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:23,103
'cause she knows that
she'd be the other option.

481
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:24,793
You're not listening to me.

482
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,103
Tori is not trustworthy.

483
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:29,827
<i>
Jonathan's impossible</i> <i>
to talk with,</i>

484
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:32,137
and he's not understanding that
there's a lot more relationships

485
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:33,241
that he's not aware of.

486
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,103
It's not that I trust her,

487
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:36,275
I'm saying we need
a backup plan.

488
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,482
You're not listening.
You're getting really worked up,

489
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:38,827
and it's hard
to communicate with you

490
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:40,758
- when you, when you go a million miles a minute.
- Sorry.

491
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:42,620
<i>
I don't think</i> <i>
she's gonna play her idol.</i>

492
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:44,000
<i>I think she's just</i> <i>
gonna go home.</i>

493
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:45,586
<i>
Being the only man,</i>

494
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,448
<i>he feels like</i> <i>
a top dog right now,</i>

495
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:49,793
and he's not listening to me.

496
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,862
<i>
Mm-hmm.</i>

497
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,137
<i>
Most people that get immunity,</i>

498
00:21:57,172 --> 00:21:59,793
they relax
and they take it easy.

499
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:02,551
I think this is the best time
to go hard in the paint.

500
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:06,034
<i>And if they listen to me,</i> <i>
we're going to the end.</i>

501
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:07,827
<i>
If we get Tori out,</i>

502
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:09,241
you have your idol,

503
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:13,068
Drea has her idol,
and we have more power.

504
00:22:13,103 --> 00:22:16,827
<i>
I'm hyped that there's
a big move that's gonna be made,</i>

505
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:18,379
<i>and I get to orchestrate it.</i>

506
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:20,620
<i>I've been waiting</i> <i>
for this moment,</i>

507
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:23,275
<i>and I'm gonna love</i> <i>
every minute of it.</i>

508
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,586
All right.

509
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,655
Before we get into
the dynamics of the vote,

510
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:02,275
I never want to take for granted

511
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,275
that you guys
are living in this.

512
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,310
- Yep.
- You're not going back to a cozy cabin.

513
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,034
Put on some music,
crank up the fireplace.

514
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:11,310
You're going back to this.

515
00:23:11,344 --> 00:23:12,551
Hai is shivering.

516
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:14,586
Your entire body is moving.

517
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,689
I have no body fat left.

518
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:19,413
Watching this on TV is amazing,

519
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:22,000
but being
out here right now sucks.

520
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,000
But, Jeff,
when you get through it,

521
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:26,172
you learn that there's
part of in you that can

522
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:29,034
push further than you would have
ever been pushed in real life.

523
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:31,655
And while it sucks now,
the lifelong lesson

524
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:33,172
is greater
than the sucky moment.

525
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:37,827
So, Mike, you go back
to the old Taku camp,

526
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:39,137
and you only have five people.

527
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:41,931
It's a new dynamic again.

528
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:43,206
Well, here's the deal, Jeff.

529
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:44,758
You-you go to sleep at night

530
00:23:44,793 --> 00:23:46,068
and, quite frankly,
you're not comfortable here.

531
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:47,827
So you wake up,
and what you do is,

532
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:49,551
you start going through
the different evolutions

533
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:51,241
of this game
that you want to play.

534
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:52,758
And you do it over
and over and over again.

535
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:54,482
You put everybody there,
you think about everybody,

536
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:55,896
what... who they are,
what they do.

537
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:58,310
Then you get out there
and you go to a challenge

538
00:23:58,344 --> 00:24:01,448
and you realize all the things
that you calculated...

539
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:03,896
...gets thrown out the door.

540
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:07,241
And then we only have
maybe two to three hours

541
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:08,689
before we're back here,
voting on somebody.

542
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:10,344
And we have to do it now.

543
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:12,344
Right now, in the rain,
on <i>Survivor.</i>

544
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:16,586
Hai, that was a great summation
what a, what a day can be like.

545
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,758
You wake up with plan A,
and then you get plan B.

546
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,551
Yeah, especially on this season,

547
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,172
where luck and your destiny

548
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:28,206
are completely
out of your control sometimes.

549
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,896
You know, we all woke up
with an idea

550
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:32,655
of what we wanted to do
at this Tribal,

551
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:35,310
but everyone had to adapt
and be flexible.

552
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:39,827
So, Rocksroy, how fast is
the game shifting for you?

553
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:42,034
Uh, I think today
we were actually

554
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:44,344
a little bit more mellow, Jeff,
to be quite honest.

555
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,034
Really?
Uh, we were...

556
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,137
- But we were...
- With only five people?

557
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:48,172
With only five people.

558
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:51,241
We spent a lot of time
just eating coconuts,

559
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:53,206
not even really
trying to strategize

560
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,551
as much as you would think.

561
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:57,724
Do you think that's a little bit
like a game of chicken?

562
00:24:57,758 --> 00:25:00,034
It could be, or it could be that

563
00:25:00,068 --> 00:25:03,689
some of us have an understanding
on what's gonna happen tonight.

564
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:05,172
Mike, there it is.

565
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:08,413
Everybody has to believe
they have an understanding,

566
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:10,310
because otherwise,
now with the Shot in the Dark,

567
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,137
everybody
could screw the game up.

568
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:15,241
So the lying has to be so good.

569
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:16,724
Yeah, and it's tough.

570
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:17,931
We don't know,
'cause he's right.

571
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:19,137
We didn't scatter today.

572
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:20,379
We just played it safe.

573
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:22,000
And then-- you're right,
it may be a game of chicken.

574
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:23,586
I only know what I'm gonna do.

575
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,931
So, Romeo,

576
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:29,413
if you had to categorize
or give a flavor

577
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:31,206
to this afternoon,
how would you label it?

578
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:33,068
Well, I just
found it interesting,

579
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:35,655
you know,
that it's an all-male tribe.

580
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:38,137
And, like, everyone just did
the whole male thing, and...

581
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:40,137
"Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. All right."

582
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,379
And then just went back
to talking about life.

583
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:42,551
It was very interesting.

584
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:45,689
Very different dynamic
with no women on this tribe.

585
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:48,172
So, Rocksroy,
when you hear Romeo say that,

586
00:25:48,206 --> 00:25:51,068
all of you guys kind of did the
"What's up? What's up?"

587
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:53,413
Is that in your wheelhouse?

588
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:55,758
As Romeo said, we kind
of acted like guys today.

589
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:59,000
We kind of, like,
dismissed that we really

590
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:01,310
had a big decision to make,
and we weren't gonna go off

591
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,551
and-and talk to each other.

592
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:05,724
But from what I saw today,
I didn't see anything

593
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:08,172
that changed my mind
to think that

594
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:12,206
what I came in thinking
tonight would be would change.

595
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:15,896
All right, then.
It is time to vote.

596
00:26:15,931 --> 00:26:18,103
Rocksroy, you're up.

597
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:52,620
I'll go tally the votes.

598
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:14,448
All right.
If anybody has an advantage

599
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:15,931
or an idol,
and you want to play it,

600
00:27:15,965 --> 00:27:17,413
now would be the time to do so.

601
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:25,448
All right, I'll read the votes.

602
00:27:28,275 --> 00:27:30,448
First vote.

603
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,482
Romeo.

604
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,172
Rocksroy.

605
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:41,689
Rocksroy.

606
00:27:41,724 --> 00:27:43,620
That's two votes Rocksroy,
one vote Romeo.

607
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,310
Ninth person voted out and
the second member of our jury--

608
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:52,413
Rocksroy. That's three.
That's enough.

609
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,827
Need to bring me your torch.

610
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:55,000
Way to go, guys.

611
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:57,517
See you, Rocks.

612
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:10,620
Rocksroy, the tribe has spoken.

613
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,344
Thank you, Jeff.
Bye, Rocks.

614
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:13,655
Good luck, guys.
Thanks, Rocks.
Bye, Rocks.

615
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:16,275
Rocksroy, you can take a spot
on the jury next to Chanelle.

616
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,275
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

617
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,965
We'll bring in the next group.

618
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:53,413
What?

619
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:55,448
Oh, my gosh.

620
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:05,827
So, getting your first look
at what just went down.

621
00:29:05,862 --> 00:29:08,931
Rocksroy voted out,
second member of the jury.

622
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:11,413
There were some reactions
as you walked in.

623
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:14,034
Drea, is that
a surprising vote?

624
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,448
Yes, definitely to me.

625
00:29:16,482 --> 00:29:18,379
So what does that tell you?

626
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:23,344
I don't know.

627
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:25,931
Lindsay, it's just a reminder

628
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:30,344
that the game is constantly
churning and turning over.

629
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:32,448
Yeah, it just threw us off guard

630
00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:34,758
from what our plan was
for the five of us here,

631
00:29:34,793 --> 00:29:37,103
because we kind of
all had an assumption

632
00:29:37,137 --> 00:29:39,517
of where that five was going.

633
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:41,965
So I think it's
lingering a little longer.

634
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,586
So, Drea, what do you have to do

635
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,448
when you're forced to adapt
with this small of a group,

636
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,448
some of whom
you may have an alliance with,

637
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:52,586
some of whom you may not?

638
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,137
You have to go back
to the drawing board

639
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:57,482
and basically see, like,
where you fit in.

640
00:29:57,517 --> 00:30:00,068
And now, as I look and I see

641
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:03,068
two people over there
that I really

642
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:06,448
did not think would be
over there so soon,

643
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:08,344
it changes your mindset.

644
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:10,344
From what?
Conservative to aggressive?

645
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,000
From trusting to not trusting?

646
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:14,758
I don't know yet.

647
00:30:14,793 --> 00:30:17,448
And, Tori, that could be
good news or bad news,

648
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,275
depending on which side
of the vote

649
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,241
you were on
when you walked in.

650
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:23,344
Right. I actually, I see this
whole twist as good news,

651
00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:24,793
because it, like,
frees people up.

652
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:26,931
And now, like, you get a chance
to work with people

653
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:28,827
that might not have
worked with you before

654
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:30,344
because there was
this bigger majority.

655
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:31,620
It's terrifying. Don't get me
wrong, it's terrifying,

656
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:33,793
'cause our odds are now
one-in-four of going home.

657
00:30:33,827 --> 00:30:35,068
Like, that is terrifying.

658
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:37,275
And, Jeff, <i>
Survivor</i> players who are great

659
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,275
need to look a step ahead.

660
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,448
Just because we're
isolated in the five

661
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:42,310
doesn't mean that
we're always going to be

662
00:30:42,344 --> 00:30:43,689
isolated in the five.

663
00:30:43,724 --> 00:30:46,000
So what's the best vote
moving forward,

664
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:48,517
in addition to what happened
at the previous Tribal?

665
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:51,310
Because we have
that information now.

666
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:55,275
So, Drea, the Rocksroy vote
could influence this vote.

667
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,172
Yeah, definitely.

668
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:59,103
And I was so proud because,
you know, like,

669
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:01,413
we have four Black contestants
in <i>Survivor.</i>

670
00:31:01,448 --> 00:31:04,241
And then it always
happens where, at one point,

671
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:06,827
the Black contestants get
booted out, boom, boom, boom.

672
00:31:06,862 --> 00:31:10,172
And then it's exactly
what this is right now.

673
00:31:10,206 --> 00:31:11,620
So, yeah, I'm pissed.

674
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:14,482
So, do you think
it's race-related?

675
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:17,655
I think it's just subconsciously
a little bit of that,

676
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:19,137
unfortunately, but...

677
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:23,034
I see now I have to play
the game a little harder now.

678
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,448
I can tell you right now
I'm playing my idol tonight

679
00:31:27,482 --> 00:31:28,965
so that I can stay in this game.

680
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:34,586
I'm not gonna let that happen
to another one of us--

681
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,103
point-blank.

682
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:39,482
It's a reset for me.
This was a game changer.

683
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:44,448
Wow. Tori, this Tribal is alive.

684
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:46,689
People are changing their minds.

685
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,689
People are declaring,
"I'm gonna play an idol."

686
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:50,344
The rain is starting
to pick up even more.

687
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:51,965
Now we got a conversation going.

688
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,655
Yeah, I mean, I support Drea
wanting to play her idol

689
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:56,068
if she feels like
she's making a stand.

690
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:57,620
I don't think it's necessary, but...

691
00:31:57,655 --> 00:31:59,448
That's because
she's not in my shoes.

692
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:01,000
But that's okay.
No, I know,

693
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:02,517
but it doesn't change my vote, so...

694
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:04,517
I'm playing it
so I can stay in the game,

695
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:05,965
and then I'm gonna
strategically play the game

696
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,965
how it should be played.

697
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,482
And, Tori,

698
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:11,275
so far, you're the only one
not in this conversation.

699
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,275
Yeah.

700
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,241
Is that okay?

701
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:14,586
I've learned
to adapt and be flexible.

702
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,517
If I'm paranoid,
emotional, crazy,

703
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:19,827
people aren't gonna
trust me, so...

704
00:32:19,862 --> 00:32:21,655
I can only do what I can do.

705
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:26,448
Okay.

706
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:38,137
Mm-hmm.

707
00:32:38,172 --> 00:32:39,689
I cannot write her name down,

708
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,137
- and I'm so sorry.
- It's okay, it's very emotional.

709
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:42,344
No, no, I literally can't.

710
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:44,827
'Cause it's, like,
you know what, everyone can hear

711
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,620
what I'm saying. Okay,
I'll just say it out loud.

712
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:48,310
It's, like, look,
Chanelle goes out.

713
00:32:48,344 --> 00:32:49,862
Okay, that's fine,
that's one thing.

714
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:51,793
Rocksroy goes out,
that's another person.

715
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:54,413
I write Drea's name out, that's
three Black people in a row.

716
00:32:54,448 --> 00:32:56,413
Okay? And <i>Survivor</i>

717
00:32:56,448 --> 00:32:58,413
isn't just about s-strategy--
it's not.

718
00:32:58,448 --> 00:33:00,137
<i>Survivor</i> is also about

719
00:33:00,172 --> 00:33:02,586
bringing the social world,
big, into a small thing.

720
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,413
If I write Drea's name
right now,

721
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:07,103
that means that I'm a part of
a perpetuating problem, so...

722
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:09,448
It's like the same thing
over and over again

723
00:33:09,482 --> 00:33:11,275
- in this game, and it sucks.
- Again and again and again.

724
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,413
I can't do it.
I'm over it.

725
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,000
So, like, we can figure
something else out,

726
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,103
but I, morally,
cannot write her name down.

727
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:18,413
- That is my line.
- I'm playing my idol,

728
00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:19,965
- so you have to figure something else out.
- I hear you.

729
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,413
I knew it was coming for me,
so ... that.

730
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:24,275
Let's play.

731
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,413
I don't feel like this is right,
because y'all

732
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:32,586
- are coming at this as like we're racist.
- Well, obviously my name...

733
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,275
No one ever said that.

734
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,931
Hold on. Let me... Hold on...
- No one ever said that.

735
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:38,758
But obviously it was
gonna be me today, right?

736
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:40,172
Was it going to be me today?
There's nothing...

737
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:42,172
It doesn't mean that that's
any... has anything to do

738
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:43,793
- with race, guys. This is a game.
- No one ever said that.

739
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:45,620
But the thing is...
Yes, y'all are. No.

740
00:33:45,655 --> 00:33:46,655
Y'all just said that.

741
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:48,793
Don't make it seem
like I'm being aggressive.

742
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,793
You are being aggressive.

743
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:52,965
- Let's calm down. This is the game, guys.
- This is what always happens...

744
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,931
It has nothing to do with race. Jonathan,

745
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:56,827
but the thing is, yes,
it is a game,

746
00:33:56,862 --> 00:33:59,413
but there are subconscious bias
that I might have

747
00:33:59,448 --> 00:34:01,344
that you don't know,
because it is subconscious.

748
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:03,000
- And that plays a part of the game as well, too.
- No, that's-that's saying

749
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:04,413
that I'm subconsciously racist,
and that's not true.

750
00:34:04,448 --> 00:34:06,793
We never said it was you.
We're saying how we feel.

751
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:09,448
Just because I'm saying
how I feel, at this moment,

752
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:11,482
does not mean that you can
make that your problem.

753
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,931
This is my situation, my issue.

754
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:16,241
I'm addressing it the way
I wanted to address it,

755
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:19,793
and the reason I wanted to play
was for representation--

756
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:22,068
because people like me
weren't represented.

757
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,344
That just is a fact.
A lot of times,

758
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:27,103
minorities get kicked off first
in this game.

759
00:34:27,137 --> 00:34:29,448
And I was hoping that
it wouldn't be the cycle,

760
00:34:29,482 --> 00:34:32,172
and it is, unfortunately.

761
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:33,413
You are not that person.

762
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:34,931
I love you.
I adore you.

763
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:36,517
I... We get along
and stuff like that.

764
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:38,448
This happens all the time,

765
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:40,689
where we speak
and then we get shut down

766
00:34:40,724 --> 00:34:43,310
as if, like, we're calling
everyone racist, and I'm not.

767
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:51,758
Drea, just to make sure
I heard you right,

768
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:53,862
you're just saying,
"Right now, I'm stepping

769
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:56,068
"outside of the game
to stand up for something

770
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:57,137
"that means something to me.

771
00:34:57,172 --> 00:34:59,068
"And within the game,
I have the power to do it,

772
00:34:59,103 --> 00:35:00,275
'cause I have an idol."

773
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:03,275
I came into this game knowing...

774
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:11,758
...I would have to think
about how I speak,

775
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:14,310
how I act.

776
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:18,862
And when we say representation,

777
00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:21,862
it's because people like us
understand each other

778
00:35:21,896 --> 00:35:24,137
and can help others
understand us, right?

779
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:25,620
So, like, if we go back,

780
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:29,068
and this is gonna get out
that maybe

781
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:30,586
they made it into,
like, a racial thing.

782
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,655
And then maybe they're like,
"Oh, well, I don't want that."

783
00:35:32,689 --> 00:35:35,068
I could be there
tomorrow anyway, so...

784
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:36,172
And then, now,

785
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:38,034
let's say that
we get to the vote,

786
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:39,758
and both of us are still here,

787
00:35:39,793 --> 00:35:41,206
and no idols are played.

788
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:43,206
Because I have an idol, too.

789
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,000
I bring it to every Tribal.

790
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:50,586
I don't think there's any votes
which are going to me tonight,

791
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,551
but I need to play this
so that people who are watching

792
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:57,206
will know that I didn't make it
another day because of race.

793
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:59,689
That it wouldn't be fair
if you could hold that,

794
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:03,137
believing you wouldn't get votes because of the topic.
You wouldn't be able to.

795
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:05,344
I, a thousand percent, Jeff,

796
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:07,551
with a thousand percent
certainty, can tell you

797
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:10,310
that if both of us don't
play our idols tonight,

798
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:13,310
there will be someone watching
and saying they used race.

799
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:15,344
- Nothing is... off-limits in <i>Survivor...</i>
- Off-limits.

800
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:18,206
And that's what I'm thinking.
Like, it just sucks.

801
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:19,862
Like, now it's gonna
become this.

802
00:36:19,896 --> 00:36:22,241
And it's like...
I never took it that way.

803
00:36:22,275 --> 00:36:24,310
I respect what
both of you are saying.

804
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:25,689
I respect
this whole conversation.

805
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:28,379
Like, I've never sat
in their shoes that way,

806
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:32,241
but I can empathize with them
for having to deal with that

807
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,241
day in and day out with things.

808
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,000
Like, it hurts me that they're
both getting so emotional

809
00:36:36,034 --> 00:36:38,172
and that that vote

810
00:36:38,206 --> 00:36:41,137
brought something
outside of the game into this.

811
00:36:41,172 --> 00:36:42,827
And, Drea, I don't feel like
you were being aggressive.

812
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:45,482
I think it was absolutely fair
for you to say that.

813
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:49,517
And it's just, I'm sorry
that they're hurting for that.

814
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:53,241
Like, Jeff, coming to this game,
my biggest fear

815
00:36:53,275 --> 00:36:56,655
wasn't going and, like, using
an advantage or idol correctly.

816
00:36:56,689 --> 00:36:59,655
My biggest fear was that I would
see some sort of injustice

817
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:01,758
and I would sit down
and do nothing.

818
00:37:01,793 --> 00:37:03,655
And, like, I'm not saying
that it's an injustice

819
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,379
for Chanelle and Rocksroy
to be voted out,

820
00:37:05,413 --> 00:37:07,034
because, like,
I don't know the full story.

821
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:09,310
But if I let
that pattern continue,

822
00:37:09,344 --> 00:37:13,034
that's an injustice for me and
my experience as a Black woman.

823
00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:15,482
And especially coming on, like, <i>
Survivor,</i> where it's, like,

824
00:37:15,517 --> 00:37:17,068
you know millions of people
will be watching,

825
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:21,310
it feels like I have to do it,
because who else will?

826
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:23,655
It's, like, so frustrating
how I have to then

827
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:26,172
incorporate that to
the way that I play the game.

828
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:29,344
Even talking to Omar previously,

829
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:32,310
there's never been a Muslim
person who has made the merge.

830
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:34,586
And that changes his gameplay--
maybe for the better,

831
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,172
maybe for the worse--
but that changes it.

832
00:37:37,206 --> 00:37:40,310
And some people don't have
to experience that burden

833
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:41,827
when they go
and they enter the game.

834
00:37:41,862 --> 00:37:46,206
Yes, we all technically have a
one-in-18 shot for the million,

835
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:48,068
but because we all come
with our burdens,

836
00:37:48,103 --> 00:37:49,551
and we all come
with our privileges,

837
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:53,206
that one-in-18 might be bigger
or smaller for some people.

838
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:54,620
And that sucks.

839
00:37:55,896 --> 00:37:57,724
Wow. That was amazing.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

840
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:02,827
Jonathan,
how are you feeling now?

841
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:04,862
Um...

842
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:09,517
I'm glad that it's cleared up
that it's not the tribe

843
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:11,689
that has
made them feel this way.

844
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:15,000
If I could, I would love
to let 'em know that I love 'em.

845
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:17,000
This isn't about me
hating you or anything.

846
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:18,655
This isn't about me
hating any of you.

847
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:20,896
- 'Cause you know that I love all of you guys.
- I know that. I know that.

848
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,379
This is a moment
bigger than the game.

849
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:24,724
Yeah.

850
00:38:24,758 --> 00:38:27,206
And seeing their emotion
is, like, hard for me

851
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:28,137
to just look past that
and be like,

852
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,344
"Okay, let's get back
to game mode."

853
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:31,310
I feel like that would minimize
their experience

854
00:38:31,344 --> 00:38:33,344
that they're feeling to be like,
"Oh, hey, by the way,

855
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,241
can we talk?" I don't know.

856
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:35,724
That's why it just feels wrong.

857
00:38:35,758 --> 00:38:37,758
Yeah, I hear you on that, too.

858
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:38,827
Yeah.

859
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:41,655
Is part of what
makes it hard to transition

860
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:43,931
is that we're now gonna
go through the formality

861
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:45,344
of walking up these stairs

862
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:48,862
and in private writing a name
down? Is that part of it?

863
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:51,344
- Yes.
- Because the other option is,

864
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:53,862
we can skip
that pomp and circumstance

865
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,862
and keep it here,

866
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:57,137
meaning it would be
talking about it.

867
00:38:57,172 --> 00:38:58,586
So, would
they turn in their idols

868
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,758
and then we go from there?

869
00:38:59,793 --> 00:39:02,344
Well, I mean,
that's their call, what they do.

870
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:09,137
Wow.

871
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:10,172
Good job, guys.

872
00:39:10,206 --> 00:39:11,620
Good job, y'all.
Thank you.

873
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:14,034
I can settle this quickly.

874
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:16,379
These are both
hidden immunity idols.

875
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:18,379
Drea's not going home.

876
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:20,344
Maryanne is not going home.

877
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:22,413
So, Lindsay,
what does that mean?

878
00:39:22,448 --> 00:39:24,206
Because Jonathan is also safe.

879
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:25,758
Sounds like it's me or Tori.

880
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:28,034
And all I can hope for is that

881
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:30,896
they want to trust me and
want to go forward with me

882
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:32,172
and feel like
I'm gonna be a good player

883
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,758
to be alongside them.

884
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:38,310
Tori, that was
a long look back to me.

885
00:39:38,344 --> 00:39:40,206
Well, I can feel
maybe you guys are

886
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:42,310
leaning more towards Lindsay.
Is that the vibe I'm getting?

887
00:39:42,344 --> 00:39:45,034
- Yeah, I'm gonna vote for you. Yeah.
- Is that the vibe I'm getting?

888
00:39:45,068 --> 00:39:46,724
Well, actually
I'd like to know why.

889
00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:48,344
Why would you like
to get rid of me?

890
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:50,517
'Cause you've been
gunning for me since Ika.

891
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:52,586
Not true, but okay.

892
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,758
You've lied to me.

893
00:39:53,793 --> 00:39:54,862
Okay, yes.

894
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:57,137
I don't have as good of
a relationship with you.

895
00:39:57,172 --> 00:39:58,862
Uh-huh. Than with her?

896
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,862
Right.

897
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,482
Okay. What are your thoughts?

898
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:04,137
The game is still on, and
I don't want to vote you out,

899
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:07,172
but part of the game's that
I have to vote someone out,

900
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:09,482
and in this moment right now,
this is the best step for me.

901
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:10,551
Which sucks.

902
00:40:10,586 --> 00:40:13,068
Well, I want to do this,
and I'm gonna go

903
00:40:13,103 --> 00:40:14,310
play my Shot in the Dark.

904
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:16,103
And we can go from there.

905
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:20,241
Okay, so you formally
are telling me

906
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:22,000
that your votes
will be for Tori?

907
00:40:22,034 --> 00:40:23,413
Right.
Yeah.

908
00:40:23,448 --> 00:40:25,172
Okay. And, Tori, you're saying

909
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:26,241
you're gonna go play
your Shot in the Dark?

910
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:28,034
I got to do what I can
at this point.

911
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:29,241
That's totally fair.

912
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:32,241
Okay.
Very unusual Tribal Council.

913
00:40:32,275 --> 00:40:33,379
Here's what it means.

914
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:36,206
It's Tori, unless she can get
the Shot in the Dark

915
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:37,206
that says you're safe.

916
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:40,000
In which case,
Lindsay, you're going home.

917
00:40:40,034 --> 00:40:42,931
All right, Tori,
go up, drop your die,

918
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:44,379
try the Shot in the Dark.

919
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:06,620
All right, Tori,
I'll take it from you.

920
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:13,379
So if this says you're safe,

921
00:41:13,413 --> 00:41:15,586
you're safe,
Lindsay, you're going home.

922
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:26,758
Tori, you are...

923
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:29,482
...not safe.

924
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:31,172
- Sorry, Tori.
- It's okay. I prayed about it.

925
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:33,137
- Sorry, Tori.
- I knew God could have made me safe,

926
00:41:33,172 --> 00:41:34,689
- but my time's up.
- Bye, Tori. I'm sorry, Tori.

927
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:36,344
Need to bring me your torch.

928
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:39,241
Bye, Tori.
You played a wild game.

929
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:50,206
- Tori, the tribe has spoken.
- No!

930
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,137
Yes.

931
00:41:52,172 --> 00:41:53,517
- Time for you to go.
- Have fun, y'all.

932
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:55,172
- Love you so much.
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

933
00:41:55,206 --> 00:41:56,379
- Bye.
- See you, Tor.

934
00:42:01,275 --> 00:42:02,655
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

935
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:04,965
- Hope you can stay dry.
- Ugh.

936
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:10,068
God literally has shown up in
so many crazy ways in this game,

937
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:12,517
and I knew
that if it was my time to stay,

938
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:14,206
that I was going
to pick the right scroll,

939
