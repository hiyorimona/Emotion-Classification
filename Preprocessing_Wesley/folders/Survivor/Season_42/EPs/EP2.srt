Yes.

213
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:18,758
Drea is really, really good
at pulling people in.

214
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,379
Yes.

215
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:22,172
<i>
She has so much sway</i> <i>

216
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:24,896
And on top of that, she has
the extra vote advantage.

217
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,241
<i>And to me, that's too much power</i> <i>

Like, I will follow you.

220
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:37,896
That's why I'm asking 'cause
I don't want it to be, like,

221
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:39,344
- because I'm talking...
- No, yeah.

222
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,172
Like, we're an alliance
so I want your opinion.

00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,758
<i>
I was maybe going to go home</i> <i>
in the last Tribal Council.</i>

224
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:46,344
I had terror, I had doubt,
I had paranoia.

225
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,310
<i>And now people want</i> <i>
to go after Drea.</i>

226
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,206
<i>The game is shifting, and so,</i>

227
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,172
for me, it's just this huge sigh
of relief.

228
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:55,724
<i>I see the way forward now,</i> <i>
and that's to get Drea out.</i>

229
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:09,344
Look at all of that wood.

230
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:10,620
Yup, we're getting there.

231
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:13,137
<i>The game I'm playing right now</i> <i>
work hard around camp</i>

233
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,068
But as I collect wood,
as I collect coconuts,

234
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:20,724
<i>as I collect palms,</i> <i>
my eyes are everywhere,</i>

235
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:23,000
<i>looking around</i> <i>
for a hidden immunity idol.</i>

236
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:30,310
<i>But I got to tell you,</i> <i>
it's much harder than you see</i>

237
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:31,551
<i>sitting in your living room.</i>

238
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,724
<i>This is dense. It-It's really</i> <i>
like looking for a needle</i>

239
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:38,758
<i>in a haystack.</i>

240
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,034
<i>It's incredible.</i> <i>
I found the idol.</i>

241
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,827
Oh, my God, you know,
it's a first.

242
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:49,241
I-I can't believe.
One of my bucket list items.

243
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,034
<i>Something in me said,</i> <i>
"Don't leave it."</i>

244
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:01,758
I came to this game saying,
"Go big or go home."

245
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,793
<i>And I'm going big.</i> <i>
How bad could it be?</i>

246
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,655
<i>So my phrase is,</i>

247
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:23,724
"There is such grace in the game
of soccer, it makes me cry."

248
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:25,344
<i>I don't like soccer.</i> <i>
Matter of fact,</i>

249
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,517
<i>when I coach my football teams,</i> <i>
I told my kids</i>

250
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,206
<i>it wasn't even a sport.</i>

251
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:32,931
But I will cry for soccer
in this instance. Never again.

252
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:42,206
Oh!

253
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,827
<i>I found an idol,</i> <i>
but I lose my vote, so</i>

254
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:48,034
there's a blessing
and there's a curse.

255
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:51,034
<i>But no matter what,</i> <i>
I'm stuck with this,</i>

256
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:53,379
<i>so it's about adapting</i> <i>
to the situation.</i>

257
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,586
<i>Because of this, I need</i> <i>
to focus more on relationships.</i>

258
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,758
<i>It's the only way</i> <i>
I can survive without a vote.</i>

259
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:25,689
If you... if you watch me do it
the first time,

260
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:27,000
- then maybe that'll help. I...
- Sure.

261
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:29,310
- Unless you want
to keep doing it.
- No, no. It...

262
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:32,241
<i>Me and Omar--</i> <i>
man, we're so different</i>

in almost every way.

264
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,000
But being different can help you
in this game.

265
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:43,586
- Thanks for that.
- Hey, man,

266
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,551
- we got each other's back.
- Yeah.

267
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,068
I love their bro time.

268
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:54,448

and I see that he trusts me.

269
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,206
Ooh.

270
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:00,724

271
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:01,724

00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:09,034
am I going to Jonathan and
saying "We ride or die, baby"?

275
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:10,551
Yeah. It's <i>The Odd Couple.</i>

276
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:12,379
This is also weird, but I had

277
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:15,724
never, um, peed standing up
until I was, like, 22.

278
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:17,482
- What?

279
00:13:17,517 --> 00:13:19,551
I got to digest this.

280
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,000
<i>He's way more funny than I am,</i>

281
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:24,137
<i>and everything</i> <i>
that he's good at,</i>

282
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,241
<i>I'm not as good at</i> <i>
and vice versa.</i>

283
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:30,137
Together we make, like,
the perfect human.

284
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:33,379
- With you, I'm... I'm tight.
- Yeah. Me, too.

285
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,827
- With Lindsay, I'm tight.
- Yeah.

286
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:38,344
I need to get closer
to Maryanne and Marya.

287
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:40,172
<i>We have me and Lindsay</i>

288
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:43,034

to how we think and

289
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:44,344
<i>being super strong.</i>

290
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:46,758

292
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:51,655
<i>

293
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:53,310

00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:56,586
<i>The only one that I'm not</i> <i>
connected with is Marya.</i>

295
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,482
What's your story
of what you want

296
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:00,241
to get out of here
other than money?

297
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:04,034
Yeah, um, it's all
wrapped around my brother.

298
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:06,517
But when he passed, um...

299
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:09,034
Okay.

300
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:11,241
I just-- I felt...
He always used to tell me,

301
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,206
"You need to, like, loosen up

302
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:15,241
and, like, just do stuff.
Stop being..."

303
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,000
Did you kind of feel like
your brother's with you

304
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,379
- right now?
- I do.

305
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:20,137
Yeah. Couldn't imagine.

306
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:24,034
- How long ago did he go?
- March, um, 2020,
so COVID, yeah.

307
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:25,137
Oh, wow.
It was, like,

308
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:26,655
right in the beginning of COVID.

309
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:29,172
He was a nurse, right?
Did you say he was a nurse?

310
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,862
- Yeah, he was a nurse. Yeah.
Mm.

311
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:32,862
<i>
James was the first</i>

312
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:37,000
health care worker to die
of COVID in the United States.

313
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:40,137
<i>He was a nurse in New York</i> <i>
doing what he wanted,</i>

314
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,551
<i>which was helping people.</i>

315
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,896
<i>But I have not processed</i> <i>
his passing.</i>

316
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:47,586
<i>Like, we haven't had closure.</i>

317
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,724
You know, I...
So, I got this little necklace.

318
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:53,000
And I got his face etched
on this side.

319
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:55,896
Oh, I didn't see the face side.

320
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:59,379
- And so my intent is
to bury this here.
Mm.

321
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:01,241
- Oh, my gosh.
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,034
That's so awesome.

323
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,931
I love that.
- So I have my own little...

324
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:07,931
- farewell.
Yeah.
Yeah. That's sweet.

325
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:11,034
<i>Losing him-- it's indescribable.</i>

326
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:13,413
I've been holding my breath
for a year

327
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:15,862
because my kids are home,
you know,

328
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:18,586
and I'm trying
to be the-the strong mom

329
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,344
<i>that keeps it all together.</i>

330
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,517
<i>So being here on</i> Survivor <i>
is about closure.</i>

331
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:27,724
<i>And for me, that would be worth</i> <i>
more than a million dollars.</i>

332
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,758
- Where was it?
- It was on the side
of the road.

333
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:37,000
What did it look like?

334
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:39,068
It's exactly what the idol
looks like you see on TV.

335
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:40,896
<i>Coming into this season,</i> <i>
I swore to myself</i>

336
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,724
<i>that I would not tell anybody</i> <i>
if I found an idol.</i>

337
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:45,172
<i>But me not having a vote--</i> <i>
it changes everything.</i>

338
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:47,655
So I decided to tell Jenny

339
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:49,827
<i>because she's my strongest ally</i> <i>
out here right now.</i>

340
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:51,000
<i>My number one.</i>

341
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:55,862
- I found it.
- Holy ..., man.

342
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:58,034
But it's not an immunity idol.

343
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:03,655
<i>I also want to try and gain an
ally, somebody smart to help me,</i>

344
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:05,793
<i>and I think</i> <i>
Daniel is a no-brainer.</i>

345
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:08,206
Okay.

346
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,034
Okay.

347
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:27,551
Hey, there was a "Y"
in the road.

348
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,000
I said,
"Let me check the 'Y' out."

349
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:30,724
I remember the "Y."

350
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:32,310
<i>When I found it, I buried</i> <i>
it quick 'cause I didn't want</i>

351
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:34,310
<i>to get caught,</i> <i>
and now I can't find it.</i>

352
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:36,241
I can't lose an idol,
and what do I do?

353
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:37,689
I mean, I got...
I don't remember

354
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:39,034
even the phrase right now.

355
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:42,103
It can't get lost. No.

356
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:52,068
<i>
Mike buried it</i> <i>
where two trails intersect.</i>

357
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:55,206
<i>And there's, like,</i> <i>
20 million trails here. I am</i>

358
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:58,068
mortified at this gameplay.

359
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:12,724
- Uh-oh.
- That's what I'm trying...

360
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,862
Uh-oh.

361
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,827
<i>
Mike has lost his vote.</i>

362
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:19,068
<i>That's a pretty,</i> <i>
pretty big deal, but</i>

363
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,137
I have the mind for the numbers,
I think, between the two of us.

364
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,206
And so, I'm basically going

365
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:24,724
to help him
figure out how to play this.

366
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:32,034
- Yeah, great, but it's on me.
- This was a... this was...

367
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:33,793
- Come on.
- Jeff Probst had a good idea.
Sorry. Okay.

368
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:35,275
<i>There's a lot</i> <i>
of moving parts in this idol,</i>

369
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,586
<i>but I might be the true winner</i> <i>
because</i>

370
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,172
I have all the knowledge without
any of the penalty right now.

371
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,103
Yes.

372
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:51,137
<i>
Daniel's got a great idea.</i>

373
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:53,551
<i>At the next immunity challenge,</i> <i>
I don't say the phrase,</i>

374
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,034
so nobody knows I have the idol
except my alliance.

375
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:57,862
<i>It's perfect.</i>

376
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,000
- Wow,
- I think the two of us

377
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:06,586
together can figure out
the best way it helps us.

378
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,931
- Yeah.
- Maybe it'll help Mike, too.

379
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:09,206
- Right.
- But most importantly,

380
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:10,482
- help us.
- Us. Yeah.

381
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:12,965
He has lost his vote
until the merge.

382
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:18,448
Absolutely.

383
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:20,448
And there's only two ways
of accomplishing that.

384
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:23,000
One is to vote Mike out.

385
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,310
And the second is to convince
Mike to never say anything.

386
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:27,620
<i>
I love how aligned</i> <i>
me and Daniel are.</i>

387
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:29,448
<i>He's my number one</i> <i>
in this game,</i>

388
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:34,103
<i>and we both agreed, Mike's idol</i> <i>
is a massive liability.</i>

389
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:36,448
And so the fact that he talks
to Daniel is great.

390
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,275
<i>We can use that against him if
we have to go to Tribal Council.</i>

391
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:56,758
Come on in!

392
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:09,586
Taku, Vati, getting your
first look at the new Ika tribe.

393
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,034
Oh, my gosh.

394
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,862
Zach voted out.
- What?
- Oh.

395
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:18,034
Maryanne, huge reaction.

396
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:21,344
I told my tribe, and I guess
I'll tell all of you.

397
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,241
Zack is like every type of white
guy that I have a crush on.

398
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:26,310
- So, there goes that.

399
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:28,689
- Really?
- Yeah.

400
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:30,310
So a blossoming love affair
is over?

401
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:32,172
No, not on <i>Survivor,</i> though.

402
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:33,896
If we met, like,
on a tribe swap,

403
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:36,413
connected after,
and then after this is over...

404
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:38,758
So I just want
to take this moment,

405
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:41,241
Maryanne,
to show how beautiful this is.

406
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:43,551
In the midst
of a very difficult game,

407
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:46,034
you still had a little hope
for love.

408
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:47,758
You know, um, I have

409
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:50,310
an 100% rejection rate with
all the guys I've liked, so...

410
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:52,586
Aw.
- I was, like, you know, I focus

411
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,344
on the game now, but
a little part of me was like...

412
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:59,206
Well, I will just say,
as somebody who loves love,

413
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,551
keep hope alive.

414
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:03,517
Just because
you've been rejected 100%,

415
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,689
it means
they aren't the right people.

416
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:07,379
That's all that means.

417
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:10,482
All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

418
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:12,931
- All right, first things first.

419
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:14,758
Got to take back the idols.

420
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:16,206
- Thank you.
- Yes.

421
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:19,172
Thank you. Oh.

422
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:22,413
- Oh, all right.

423
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:24,758
- Duly noted.

424
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,896
Once again, immunity is
back up for grabs.

425
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:29,137
For today's challenge,

426
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:30,551
<i>one person will be your caller.</i>

427
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:33,137
<i>The rest of the tribe</i> <i>
will be blindfolded.</i>

428
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:35,206
<i>Using only verbal commands,</i>

429
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:37,931
<i>the caller will instruct</i> <i>
the blindfolded pairs</i>

430
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:39,724
<i>to collect three bags</i> <i>
of puzzle pieces.</i>

431
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:44,241
<i>Once you have all the bags,</i>

432
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,586
<i>the caller will then instruct</i>

433
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,000
<i>a still blindfolded pair</i> <i>
to solve the puzzle.</i>

434
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:51,000
The first two tribes to finish

435
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:52,448
win immunity,
safe from the vote.

436
00:20:52,482 --> 00:20:54,241
In addition,
playing for a reward.

437
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:56,137
- Thank God.
- Want to know
what you're playing for?

438
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,137
Yes!

439
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,068
- Please, Jeff.
- First tribe to finish,

440
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:01,448
- a massive set of fishing gear.
- Wow.

441
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:03,965
Second tribe to finish,

442
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,586
a smaller but still
very effective and useful

443
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,310
- set of fishing gear.
- Nice.

444
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:10,482
Last tribe to finish,
Tribal Council,

445
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:12,724
where somebody will be the third
person voted out of this game.

446
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:14,965
And in addition,
as a penalty for losing,

447
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,241
you'll sacrifice your flint.

448
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,586
Ika, I still have yours.

449
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,620
You are playing
to get yours back.

450
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,758
Vati, you have one extra person.
You're gonna sit somebody out.

451
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:23,068
- Who's it gonna be?
- Me, Jeff.

452
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:24,724
Daniel gonna sit this one out.

453
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:26,103
Everybody else,
give you a minute to strategize.

454
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:28,896
- We'll get started. Here we go.
Yeah.

455
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,241
All right, we have our callers.

456
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:36,793
For Ika, Drea.

457
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:38,413
Vati, Lydia.

458
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:40,655
Taku, Jonathan.

459
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:43,931
Here we go,
for immunity and reward,

460
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:45,172
survivors ready.

461
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:50,137
- Go.
Go straight. Tori.

462
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:51,448
- Tori. Tori...
Hey, Mike, Mike, Mike...

463
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:52,931
Caller is the tough job...

464
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:55,068
Straight. Straight.
You're gonna hit a barrel.

465
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:59,482
-...because they're responsible
for directing everybody.

466
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:01,310
Turn your body, Chanelle.

467
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:02,275
Which way?

468
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,275
- We got three callers...
Stop.

469
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,482
- Stop where you are.
-...trying to talk
over each other.

470
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:09,034
Lydia, we cannot hear you.

471
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:10,482
I'm talking.

472
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:12,241
- The players are talking.
- Right. Right, right, right...

473
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,482
Straight ahead. Keep going.

474
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:19,103
- You're there. You're there.
Yeah, go straight!
Keep going, keep going!

475
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,379
That's your key!
Don't go past that!

476
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:23,103
- Chanelle spinning for Vati.
Stop, lean forward!

477
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:24,793
Jenny, keep up, keep up.
Keep up.

478
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:28,137
Omar slowly being spun
for Taku.
Romeo, stop!

479
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:29,344
More left!

480
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:31,793
Jonathan, trying to get ahold
of his tribe

481
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:33,068
- by yelling.
- Hey, Lindsay!

482
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,896
Lindsay and Maryanne stuck.

483
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:36,551
- They don't know
where they're going.
No, you're good!

484
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,379
You've got to get your puzzle
pieces and you got to get back.

485
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:41,517
Yes! Go under! Go under!

486
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:46,068
Vati is in the sawdust now.

487
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:48,551
- Mike untying.

488
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:50,448
- Is this blue?
- Down, Tori!

489
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:53,103
Down. Pull it down.

490
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:54,103
Ika's now through.

491
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:55,551
Now they've got
to find that post.

492
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:57,655
- I got it. Go.
- Stop. Okay.

493
00:22:57,689 --> 00:23:00,310
You're there! Dig the hole!

494
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,724
Nothing is easy
when you're blindfolded.

495
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,655
Swati, reach to your left!

496
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:08,379
Tori's got the post for Ika now.

497
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:10,206
Forward, Romeo!
Orange and blue,

498
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:12,586
holding hands
with the wrong tribe member.

499
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,448
Not sure where they're going.

500
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:17,379
Chanelle and Jenny
trying to find their way back.

501
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:19,448
Both of y'all bitches,
come here!

502
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,448
Vati back with the first bag.

503
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:24,758
And just like that,
Vati back with the second bag.

504
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:25,758
Go straight.

505
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:28,034
Lydia doing a great job
for Vati.

506
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:29,482
They are in the early lead.

507
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:31,620
Ika coming back
with their first bag.

508
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:33,000
It's Tori and Swati.

509
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:35,137
You're good.
Drea with a nice job.

510
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:37,241
Right here!

511
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:39,000
- Can you hear me?!
Yes.

512
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,724
Omar and Marya back
with the first bag for Taku.

513
00:23:41,758 --> 00:23:42,931
Drop it there!

514
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,793
Rocksroy and Romeo

515
00:23:44,827 --> 00:23:46,137
- working together.
Go, go, go.

516
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:49,034
Keep going around.
Turn me around. Turn me around.

517
00:23:49,068 --> 00:23:51,793
Hey, Lindsay! Straight ahead!

518
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:53,206
- Oh.
- Okay, we're almost there.

519
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:54,448
- Yeah, girl!
Go.

520
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:56,724
Maryanne and Lindsay

521
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,793
untying the spool for Taku.

522
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:00,724
Turn me around. Turn me around.

523
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:03,034
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

524
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,724
Shimmy. Stop!

525
00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:06,344
Go forward, Tori!

526
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,724
Go to the other side!
Chanelle and Jenny
now are getting

527
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:10,206
all tangled in that rope.

528
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,793
You got to be
behind the hitching post.

529
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,206
And that's gonna be
a problem now for Vati.

530
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:17,103
They were doing a great job.

531
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:18,413
- Okay. Okay.
- Pull.

532
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:21,034
It's now Tori and Swati
now on the spool.

533
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:23,448
- Omar's untying.
Got it.

534
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:25,103
Rocksroy heading back
with a second bag.

535
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:27,793
Boys, stop on that.
Put it down. Stay there.

536
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:32,000
- Grab this.
- Now it's Lindsay and Maryanne
who are tied up.

537
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:34,034
- They're all tangled
in the rope.
- I went under.

538
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:37,241
Everybody getting tangled
except for Swati and Tori.

539
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,034
Hell yeah, baby.

540
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:39,310
Right here! Straight!

541
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,655
Taku heading back
with a second bag.

542
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,793
We are neck and neck.

543
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:44,724
It's gonna come down
to the spooling right now.

544
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:45,931
You okay?

545
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:49,137
Who can manage their ropes
without getting all tangled?

546
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:50,758
Drop the puzzle pieces.

547
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,586
- Yeah, yeah.
Lindsay and Maryanne

548
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,034
have the bag for Taku.

549
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:55,379
They're heading back.

550
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:57,793
There you go. Hey.
- That's gonna leave a big mark.

551
00:24:57,827 --> 00:24:59,413
- There you go. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.
You okay?

552
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:01,482
And another big obstacle.

553
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:03,206
- All right.
- Shizzlesticks.

554
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:05,241
- You got it?
- Yeah, let's go.

555
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:06,620
Tori and Swati
coming back with their bag.

556
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:07,827
Left, Tori!

557
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:08,827
Go underneath!

558
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:10,206
It's Taku and Ika right now.

559
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,620
Drop down! Drop down!

560
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,310
Vati is all tangled up.
- Lydia!

561
00:25:16,344 --> 00:25:17,931
I can't see!

562
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:19,896
Still struggling to
figure out what is happening.

563
00:25:22,862 --> 00:25:25,379
Now Taku heading back
with their third and final bag.

564
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:26,586
Ow!

565
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,103
Ika right behind them.

566
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:32,103
We got a challenge on day five
of <i>Survivor 42.</i>

567
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:33,310
I got it. I got it.

568
00:25:33,344 --> 00:25:34,793
Jenny finally has found the bag.

569
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,137
Now she's got to get it untied.

570
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:38,413
They got to get back.
It is Vati now in dead last.

571
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:41,931
Taku has all three bags.
You can start heading out.

572
00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:43,000
Everyone hold hands.

573
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:45,241
Ika's back. You're good.

574
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:46,896
Yes, no hesitation.
Just roll with me, baby.

575
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:51,000
Jonathan leading Taku out.
Everybody holding hands.

576
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:53,896
Here comes Jenny and Chanelle.
Not giving up.

577
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:56,034
Go straight to the sawdust!

578
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:57,206
I got you.

579
00:25:57,241 --> 00:25:59,931
Ika's going through,
Taku's going through,

580
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:02,241
while Vati is heading back.

581
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:03,896
You got to get
all your bags back,

582
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:05,413
then you got to come back out.

583
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:07,034
Follow me. Come on.

584
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:10,103
A big hit.

585
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:11,758
- Rocksroy goes hard.

586
00:26:11,793 --> 00:26:14,172
He's gonna feel that one
for a few days.

587
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:17,793
Vati is back.

588
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,793
Now Lydia can
lead her tribe out.

589
00:26:19,827 --> 00:26:21,103
Follow me.
Get in a line. Get in a line.

590
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:23,137
All right, we're here.
We're here.
What?

591
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:24,655
Omar, give me your hand.

592
00:26:24,689 --> 00:26:26,137
Jonathan's still the caller.

593
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:28,206
Drea's still the caller.

594
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:31,896
- Vati quickly trying
to get back into this.
- Let's go, guys, let's go.

595
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:35,103
Huge comeback for Vati.

596
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:38,068
Got to get all the pieces out
on the table

597
00:26:38,103 --> 00:26:40,137
and then solve it.
Immunity on the line.

598
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:42,896
- Somebody is going home tonight.
Guys, everyone
get in a line.

599
00:26:42,931 --> 00:26:45,793
Somebody's dream
of winning <i>Survivor</i>

600
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,206
is hours away from ending.

601
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:48,793
Take that one...
This is the center.

602
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:51,241
- I want you to drop it...
The only way to make
sure it's not you

603
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:52,241
is you got to win.

604
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:53,379
No, here. Go here.

605
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,103
- Right here. Go right...

606
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:57,172
Got all three tribes now
on the puzzle.

607
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:03,241
Different strategies about
how you lead at this point.

608
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:04,896
No, that's not the piece
you just put down. To your left.

609
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:06,448
Put those kind of to the side.

610
00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:08,241
You just have to connect

611
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:09,931
with the two people
who are solving the puzzle.

612
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:11,965
This is about
communication styles.

613
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,137
Hey, no, no, no, no, no. Listen.

614
00:27:13,172 --> 00:27:14,275
Don't freak out.

615
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,482
I'm-I'm good.

616
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,655
Jenny,
you have to place it there.

617
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:19,448
Jenny trying to place
another piece for Vati.

618
00:27:19,482 --> 00:27:21,241
Yes, that goes right there.
That goes right there.

619
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:22,724
Now fit this other piece around.

620
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,586
Drea now looking
for that next level.

621
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,068
They've got
the outer edge built.

622
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,655
It's a pizza.

623
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,310
Taku's taking
a different strategy,

624
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:30,448
building from the bottom up.

625
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,586
Every piece matters
and every piece counts.

626
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,206
- Little bit more, little bit
more, little bit more. Yes!
Yeah. No. Other...

627
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:35,931
Keep it there.
Huge stakes.

628
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:37,724
You just don't want to be last.

629
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:38,758
Fit that bitch in.

630
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:40,137
Move the one on top.
That's it...

631
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:42,482
Another piece for Ika.

632
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:44,034
Yes, okay, now...

633
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:45,620
Another piece for Taku.

634
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:46,758
There, keep going. Keep going...

635
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:48,034
- Yes.

636
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,206
This is gonna come down
to a few seconds.

637
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:52,931
- Right there.
All three tribes
are very close.

638
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:54,655
No, push that, and put that
middle piece in with the notch.

639
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:56,724
With the notch. Oh, my God.
You've got one piece left.

640
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,620
- In the middle.
Put it in the middle.
- Move straight.

641
00:27:58,655 --> 00:28:00,310
Vati with one piece left.

642
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,206
Put it right there.
Put it right there. Yes.

643
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:04,965
- Jeff! Jeff!
- Vati thinks they have it.
They do!

644
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,103
- Yes! Yes!
Put it in the middle.

645
00:28:07,137 --> 00:28:08,275
Yeah, baby!

646
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,000
- We're looking for one more!
Sorry.

647
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:11,931
Taku with two.

648
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:14,068
Ika down to two pieces.

649
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:16,413
- It's gonna be a race.
We got it?
We won.

650
00:28:16,448 --> 00:28:18,551
- We won. That's it. That's it.
Come on, guys.

651
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:21,586
One piece left.
That's it. To the right.
Put it there. Jeff!

652
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,758
Marya, can you grab that piece?
Yes, that's it. Yeah, right...

653
00:28:23,793 --> 00:28:26,482
Right there.
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

654
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:28,275
Ika's done it!

655
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,310
Ika wins immunity!

656
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:31,793
Safe from Tribal Council.

657
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:34,965
Sending Taku to Tribal Council,

658
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,206
where the third person
will be voted out of this game.

659
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:41,241
Wow, that was a finish.

660
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:42,413
- Yeah!

661
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,000
Oh, my God.

662
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:49,448
Vati, congratulations.
Immunity is yours.

663
00:28:49,482 --> 00:28:52,000
Lydia, you put yourself in a
big-time role and you delivered.

664
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:55,241
Fishing gear will be waiting
for you back at camp.

665
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,379
No Tribal Council tonight.

666
00:28:56,413 --> 00:28:57,379
- Ika.

667
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:59,206
- I know this feels good.

668
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:01,310
Yes. Get it, get it, girl.
Get it, girl.

669
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:03,413
Drea gonna take it.
- Yes, ma'am.

670
00:29:03,448 --> 00:29:05,413
Your fishing gear will be
waiting for you back at camp,

671
00:29:05,448 --> 00:29:06,241
as well as your flint.

672
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:07,724
- You get that back.
- Thank you.

673
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:09,413
Ika, Vati, grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

674
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:10,862
Enjoy the night off.

675
00:29:12,103 --> 00:29:13,620
Well done.

676
00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:16,965
All right, Taku,
Tribal Council tonight.

677
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,448
Somebody will be the third
person voted out of this game.

678
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:21,310
Before you go,
I'll take your flint.

679
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:24,275
Sorry for you.

680
00:29:25,793 --> 00:29:27,724
All right, Taku,
grab your stuff.

681
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:30,275
Head back to camp.
See you tonight at Tribal.

682
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,206
<i>
Tonight's Tribal,</i>

683
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:34,275
it's like going on
the worst first date ever.

684
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,413
<i>You show up</i> <i>
with the person you like,</i>

685
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:39,482
<i>and then, in the end, they leave</i> <i>
and you never see them again.</i>

686
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:42,034
<i>And hopefully,</i> <i>
after Tribal Council,</i>

687
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:43,620
<i>my heart isn't broken.</i>

688
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:55,413
<i>Do you think</i> <i>
I'm in trouble tonight?</i>

689
00:29:55,448 --> 00:29:56,482
<i>
Not at all.</i>

690
00:29:56,517 --> 00:29:59,068
'Cause to me it's not even
a question about you,

691
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:00,172
- because...
- And I got your back.

692
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:01,137
- If anybody mentions you...
- Yeah.

693
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:02,275
- Same. Same.
-...I'm gonna come tell you.

694
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,896
- I think we have two options.
- Yeah.

695
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,068
<i>
Marya or Maryanne.</i>

696
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:08,068
<i>I think, long-term,</i>

697
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:10,344
<i>-Maryanne's a bit less</i> <i>
trustworthy than Marya...</i> <i>
- Yes.</i>

698
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:13,034
But in the short-term,
who's gonna help us more?

699
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,862
Man.

700
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:17,034
<i>
This is not an easy task.</i>

701
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:20,172
<i>Marya is so wise,</i>

702
00:30:20,206 --> 00:30:22,068
<i>and she's a mom, you know?</i>

703
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:24,758
She's got it more put together.

704
00:30:24,793 --> 00:30:27,068
Maryanne's still getting
everything figured out,

705
00:30:27,103 --> 00:30:30,896
<i>but I love Maryanne,</i> <i>
like, I connect with her.</i>

706
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:32,896
- We need to work
to make Marya feel safe.
- Yes.

707
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,068
She doesn't play
her Shot in the Dark.

708
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:36,379
- Right.
- And then make sure
that Maryanne

709
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:38,068
also doesn't play
her Shot in the Dark.

710
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,241
<i>
When you play</i> <i>
the Shot in the Dark correctly,</i>

711
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:41,620
<i>you get immunity.</i>

712
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:42,965
So... whew.

713
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,206
You have to look at both of
these women in the eyes and go,

714
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:49,620
"I am not going
to vote you out."

715
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:51,413
I'm not voting for you.

716
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:53,103
- I know.
- Look at me. Look at me.
I'm serious.

717
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:54,344
No, I know. I know.

718
00:30:54,379 --> 00:30:57,724
<i>No matter what,</i> <i>
we have to bold-faced lie.</i>

719
00:30:57,758 --> 00:31:00,103
<i>And right now, one of those two</i>

720
00:31:00,137 --> 00:31:01,448
<i>are gonna get</i> <i>
their hearts broken.</i>

721
00:31:01,482 --> 00:31:03,034
So, what's the story?

722
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:05,517
So, my gut is Maryanne.

723
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:07,206
That was what I was thinking.

724
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:12,344
Yeah, I don't know
if I can do that for 26 days.

725
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:14,103
<i>Yes.</i> <i>
That's a little much.</i>

726
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:15,724
Like, I know in my gut
it's gonna be

727
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:17,965
my name
that's written down by her.

728
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,517
So I know,
I'm-I'm sure she's thinking

729
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:21,241
it's either me or Marya, right?

730
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,689
- Right.
- Like, and that--
Like, it's period.

731
00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:26,862
<i>
I believe she would vote me,</i>

732
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:28,793
so I think that you guys
should tell her

733
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:30,034
- that's what you're doing.
- Yeah. Okay.

734
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:32,344
<i>
We all, on the surface,</i> <i>
seem to be</i>

735
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:34,586
<i>in sync</i> <i>
with who it should be, but...</i>

736
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,862
<i>I could be a huge fool.</i>

737
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,862
Like, maybe they're
hiding something.

738
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,172
There is something more there.

739
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:42,517
<i>So I'm bringing</i> <i>
my Shot in the Dark to Tribal,</i>

740
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:43,517
<i>no question.</i>

741
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:44,689
Dang it.

742
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:47,793
Dang. Five days,
and my name's gonna be put down.

743
00:31:47,827 --> 00:31:49,586
Well, not-not by your people.

744
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,586
I know, not by...

745
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
But, like, dang it, you know?

746
00:31:53,655 --> 00:31:54,896
<i>I'm terrified.</i>

747
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:58,172
Plus, there's a chance
I have no power at all.

748
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:02,068
<i>On day two, I risk my vote
to either A] get an extra vote,</i>

749
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:05,379
or B] lose my vote
at this Tribal Council.

750
00:32:06,655 --> 00:32:07,655
Mm-hmm.

751
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:11,620
And, like, that's, like,
my task for today.

752
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:13,896
<i>Literally, my life</i> <i>
isn't even in my hand.</i>

753
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:15,034
Dang it.

754
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:16,551
<i>And they can just</i> <i>
kick me in the dirt.</i>

755
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:18,241
So what do nervous people do?

756
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:19,379
They look for idols.

757
00:32:22,137 --> 00:32:24,551
This is so nasty.

758
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:29,172
Do you think
sometimes her being emotional

759
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:30,793
can turn into paranoia
at the same time, or no?

760
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:32,241
<i>
I don't know.</i>

761
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:40,551
I was looking around for
those flowers that you found,

762
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:41,965
but I couldn't see 'em.

763
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,724
<i>Okay, clearly</i> <i>
she's looking for an idol.</i>

764
00:32:43,758 --> 00:32:45,758
<i>She cannot control herself.</i>

765
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,448
Okay. No problem.

766
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:50,896
<i>
I feel like Maryanne does get</i> <i>
flustered under pressure.</i>

767
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:53,206
<i>Like, one of the things</i> <i>
that I look for in an alliance</i>

768
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:55,517
is they don't panic and, like,
burn to the ground

769
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:56,896
and take me down with them.

770
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:00,103
- How do you feel?
- I think we're gonna need

771
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:03,068
four people to go forward
that are going to,

772
00:33:03,103 --> 00:33:05,965
like, kill it
with social and hustle.

773
00:33:07,482 --> 00:33:08,482
Yeah.

774
00:33:09,482 --> 00:33:11,172
But I do think...

775
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:12,103
- Who?
- Marya.

776
00:33:12,137 --> 00:33:13,241
Yeah.

777
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:15,586
<i>It would be so difficult</i> <i>
to see Marya go</i>

778
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,034
<i>when we've connected</i> <i>
so strongly,</i>

779
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:20,103
because she's lost her brother,

780
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:22,068
<i>and she's seeking closure</i> <i>
out here.</i>

781
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:23,758
<i>So my heart</i> <i>
is literally breaking,</i>

782
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,034
<i>because she may be</i> <i>
going home tonight.</i>

783
00:33:26,068 --> 00:33:29,275
Are you worried enough to, like,
play your Shot in the Dark?

784
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,758
I'm gonna go with my gut.

785
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:33,172
<i>
I actually trust her</i> <i>
more than Maryanne.</i>

786
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:35,793
<i>She's a ball of energy.</i> <i>
She's a wild card.</i>

787
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:40,517
Maybe she can, um, have, like,
a great romance at Ponderosa.

788
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:44,034
<i>But Maryanne</i> <i>
brings life to the camp,</i>

789
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:46,172
and she has the hustle
that we need

790
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:47,620
to battle two other tribes.

791
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:51,034
<i>Because now Taku's down</i> <i>
to four people, after tonight.</i>

792
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:52,586
<i>Up until now,</i> <i>
we have been a family,</i>

793
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,620
but the sun's gonna set

794
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:56,103
and someone's dream
is gonna get crushed.

795
00:34:16,827 --> 00:34:19,206
Behind each of you is a torch.
Go ahead and grab a torch.

796
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:22,379
Approach the flame,
dip it in, and get fire.

797
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:29,172
This is part of
the ritual of Tribal Council,

798
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:32,586
because in this game,
fire represents your life,

799
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,862
and when your fire is gone,
so are you.

800
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:39,586
It's fun to say, not fun
when you think about it.

801
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,862
No. Not at all.

802
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:42,068
Mm-mm.

803
00:34:42,103 --> 00:34:43,344
Omar, as much excitement
as I saw,

804
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,448
even on your face
when you walked in here,

805
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:47,724
this is where death happens.

806
00:34:47,758 --> 00:34:49,275
Yeah, I mean,
as a fan of the show,

807
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,379
coming to Tribal Council,
it's unbelievable.

808
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:54,275
But on the other hand,
there's the horrible side

809
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,758
that we have to cut
a family member loose tonight.

810
00:34:57,793 --> 00:34:58,896
And this truly is a family

811
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,344
after five days.

812
00:35:00,379 --> 00:35:01,965
Absolutely.

813
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,689
I mean, we've shared
a lot together in five days.

814
00:35:04,724 --> 00:35:06,689
Like, I know their stories.

815
00:35:06,724 --> 00:35:07,758
Omar, that's really interesting

816
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:10,413
because the bookend
to coming out here

817
00:35:10,448 --> 00:35:12,620
and feeling like
you can bond with people

818
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:16,034
is that now you feel
some level of moral obligation

819
00:35:16,068 --> 00:35:18,620
to be a little more honest
than you might want to be.

820
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:20,241
- Yeah.
But you can't be
too honest.

821
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:22,172
Yeah, like, you don't want
to lie to their face,

822
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:25,793
but at the same it's like
Darwin's theory of evolution.

823
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:27,931
Like, there's a selection
pressure on us now,

824
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:29,862
especially with
the Shot in the Dark,

825
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:32,620
where everybody has to think
that they're safe,

826
00:35:32,655 --> 00:35:34,482
but not everybody's
going to be safe.

827
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,448
Jonathan,
if it's a natural selection,

828
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:39,034
or if it's
survival of the fittest,

829
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:40,413
you're basically saying,

830
00:35:40,448 --> 00:35:43,413
how do I make sure
I don't come back here?

831
00:35:43,448 --> 00:35:46,172
By keeping the people
who are with me

832
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:47,517
strong enough to win challenges.

833
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:48,620
- That's really it.
Right.

834
00:35:48,655 --> 00:35:51,275
Yeah, and, like,
strength in this game

835
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,241
comes in all different shapes
and forms.

836
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:56,310
You know,
physical strength is one thing,

837
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:58,137
mental strength is another.

838
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:01,482
Social game is another.
All connected is what you need.

839
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:03,965
- You can't just have one.
- I agree.

840
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,655
But, Lindsay,
what's interesting about that,

841
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:07,103
there are five people

842
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:08,413
who all believe

843
00:36:08,448 --> 00:36:10,413
that you'll be stronger
after this vote.

844
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:12,000
That's the hard part,

845
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:14,827
because obviously it's only
going to end up being four.

846
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:18,241
It's trying to be
as level-headed as you can

847
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:20,103
to balance out your paranoia

848
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,931
with your trust of who you have

849
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:23,758
and hope it works out.

850
00:36:23,793 --> 00:36:25,241
Maryanne, was there much talk

851
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:26,413
of Shot in the Dark?

852
00:36:26,448 --> 00:36:29,103
I feel as if it's always
in the back of our heads,

853
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:31,172
you know, 'cause that now adds
another layer to the strategy.

854
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:34,827
So it's, like, do you now go
with Plan A, B, C, then D,

855
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:38,448
or Plan A Subsection A,
Plan B Subsection B?

856
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:40,586
And then, if two people use it,
then you have now

857
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,931
another subsection,
and then another, and another.

858
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:44,655
You just have so many things
that you're thinking about.

859
00:36:44,689 --> 00:36:47,241
Like, "Oh, my G." It's, like,
so easy to just kind of go,

860
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:48,793
like...

861
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:50,620
When just one little
measly thing,

862
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:52,310
which is, like, this tiny.

863
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:56,586
Wow. So, Maryanne,
let's say it's you.

864
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,206
That big smile, that big laugh,
full of emotion.

865
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:02,689
What's the reaction?

866
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:04,758
I think right now,
going to Tribal, is

867
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:06,827
when I just realized, "Oh,

868
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm actually playing <i>Survivor."</i>

869
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:11,103
And it's like, I want
to do more and learn more

870
00:37:11,137 --> 00:37:14,310
with my tribe members.
Like, don't send me to Zach.

871
00:37:14,344 --> 00:37:15,517
I'm not ready. Please.

872
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:17,689
So love really is

873
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:19,448
on your mind right now, right?

874
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,586
Well, you brought it up
twice today.

875
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,448
It's like, being 23 and, like,
always single, it's like,

876
00:37:25,482 --> 00:37:27,172
maybe there's something wrong
with you

877
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:29,172
because no one romantically
likes you, you know?

878
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,586
And it's like, it's something

879
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,413
which I've always
been working on, and

880
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:34,655
the thing is, like,
Zachary-- literally

881
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:37,034
picture perfect. And I'm like,
"Hey, God, is that you?" Like,

882
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:38,620
wow, is this like a two-for-one?

883
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:40,310
You win <i>Survivor,</i>
and then you also get a man?

884
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,310
And then it's like in the
reunion, Jeff's like, "Yeah,

885
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,862
Maryanne, so you started to
date Zach. How'd that work out?"

886
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,517
And I'm like, "Well, Jeff, thank
you for putting me on Season 42.

887
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:49,448
It's a whole big side."

888
00:37:49,482 --> 00:37:51,586
But, like, you know,
it's like, even though the part

889
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,413
of the game is about winning,
you still think

890
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:56,344
about the little things, too.

891
00:37:56,379 --> 00:37:58,241
Oh, I was just
getting comfortable.

892
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,413
Oh, you want me...?
I can go more. I-I love

893
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:03,034
- saying my piece.

894
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:04,931
Okay, so Marya,

895
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:06,413
you talked about getting
to know everybody.

896
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:07,862
There's a perfect example.

897
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:10,172
She's been very open
about sharing

898
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,758
- how she's looking for love.

899
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:16,413
And yet, if the vote goes
the wrong way for her tonight,

900
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:19,000
it means, "Yeah, we like you
and we hope you find love,

901
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:20,689
but we don't want you
on the tribe."

902
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:23,413
Yeah, I mean,
it would be very hard.

903
00:38:23,448 --> 00:38:28,103
However, part of my journey
here is to stop being the mom

904
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:29,862
and the caretaker,
'cause that's what I do.

905
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,344
I have to make sure

906
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:33,448
everybody else is taken care of,
and part of

907
00:38:33,482 --> 00:38:35,758
what I want to accomplish here
is to put me first.

908
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:39,241
So, I need to put Marya first
for once.

909
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,448
So, Lindsay,
how do you vote out Marya

910
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:43,172
when she says, "Look,
I'm gonna take care of me.

911
00:38:43,206 --> 00:38:44,586
I got some more journey I need"?

912
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,413
No matter who we vote out,

913
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:47,862
it's going
to be extremely difficult,

914
00:38:47,896 --> 00:38:50,034
but you have to kind of balance

915
00:38:50,068 --> 00:38:52,413
the personal relationships
that you gain

916
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:55,413
and then your game
and what you want for yourself.

917
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:58,068
And you want to make sure
one doesn't overlap the other.

918
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,482
Absolutely, there's a line.
It's like,

919
00:39:00,517 --> 00:39:04,241
I love everybody,
but there's a game to be played.

920
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,000
I mean, it's that simple.

921
00:39:06,034 --> 00:39:07,241
Wow.

922
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:08,620
It's that simple.

923
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:11,827
On that note,
it is time to vote.

924
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:14,344
Marya, you're up.

925
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:35,655
Thank you, God.

926
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:37,965
Oh, my gosh. Yes.

927
00:39:51,482 --> 00:39:53,793
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol,

928
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:56,655
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

929
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:04,310
Jeff?

930
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:07,620
I'm gonna play
my Shot in the Dark.

931
00:40:09,103 --> 00:40:11,310
Great. I'll take it.

932
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:12,655
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

933
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:17,758
Marya played
her Shot in the Dark,

934
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:19,344
which means she did not vote.

935
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:21,448
Taking a one-in-six shot
for safety in the game.

936
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:23,068
If this says you are safe,

937
00:40:23,103 --> 00:40:25,172
then any votes cast
against you will not count.

938
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:26,482
If it says you're not safe,

939
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:28,827
then any votes cast
against you will still count.

940
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:30,896
I'll open the scroll.

941
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:42,862
Marya, you are...

942
00:40:42,896 --> 00:40:44,655
not safe.

943
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:47,586
Any votes cast against Marya
will still count.

944
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,793
I'll read the votes.

945
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,793
First vote--

946
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:54,275
Marya.

947
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,379
Marya. Two votes-- Marya.

948
00:41:06,724 --> 00:41:09,689
Third person voted
out of <i>Survivor 42--</i>

949
00:41:09,724 --> 00:41:11,103
Marya.
That's three. That's enough.

950
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:13,103
You need to bring me your torch.

951
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,310
Bye, girl.

952
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:16,310
Love you.

953
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:28,241
Marya, the tribe has spoken.

954
00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:32,517
- Time for you to go.
- Hey, you guys, bring it home.

955
00:41:32,551 --> 00:41:34,310
- Bye, Marya.

956
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:35,793
Love you.

957
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:44,344
Grab your torches,
head back to camp. Good night.
