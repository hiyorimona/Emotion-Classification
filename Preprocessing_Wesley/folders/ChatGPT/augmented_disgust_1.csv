Then I'll clean it the day after tomorrow.,disgust
What kind of pest do we have to do?,disgust
"Thank you, Mom.",disgust
"How's Ron Marston, Pauline?",disgust

How was the business trip?,disgust
She can deal with it.,disgust
"Tom, did you enjoy your lunch?",disgust
What's the matter?,disgust
"Yeah, I'll try to do the same thing.So, I was wondering if you wanted to go out for dinner Friday night?",disgust
The mosquitoes bite me!,disgust
What are you doing?,disgust
"Thank you dear! You have such a sense of fashion.Now, what am I going to do with my hair?",disgust
"Well, you should have chosen, in the end you always complain about everything.",disgust
It's right under you! Kathy!!!,disgust
Calm down!,disgust
I'm tired of this job.,disgust

"The pirates are smart, and they want people to know.",disgust
So they're creating viruses to tell people they're smart?,disgust
There'll be another sandstorm here tomorrow.,disgust
"Look, you can still learn a lot to watch TV, you just need to be smart when you watch. Filter information and decide whether you believe what you hear or not.",disgust
Why?,disgust
He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster.,disgust
I thought all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs.,disgust
They are. The only reason they didn't disqualify him before after the race is because the results of the text only came back later.,disgust
It's so disappointing. I don't know why the best athletes would feel the need to take drugs.,disgust
"Oh, look, they're lowering the lights, I think we should go back to our seats for the second half of the room.",disgust
"I recommend you ride a bike instead of a bus ride. It can offer you many advantages. First, it's good for your health. I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to elaborate further. While many people spend time like an hour each morning of exercise, a bike ride to work not only builds you, but also makes full use of time. You might as well sleep for a longer hour.",disgust
Seems like you're angry when you hear that I'm renting another guy.,disgust
How come you think of him like that?,disgust
How's your stuff?,disgust
It's supposed to rain.,disgust
It says a storm could come tomorrow.,disgust

Why?,disgust
You're right.,disgust
I don't think much about the movie.,disgust
"Oh, I'm not sure I agree with you, it wasn't a good one, but it wasn't the worst.",disgust
"Well, since you agree with me, we should put the question over the board instead of talking about it through other channels.",disgust
What do you think of the new TV channel? Isn't the programs horrible?,disgust
"I totally agree with you, they're terrible, they're completely wasted, but my wife doesn't agree with me.",disgust

"Yeah, I found it excellent, didn't I?",disgust
"It's a beautiful cinema, isn't it?",disgust
What about the summer?,disgust
Do you like this campus?,disgust
Why?,disgust
What about the summer?,disgust

"Hmm. I have the same problem. When I leave work, it's always rush hour. So the buses are always crowded.",disgust
"Oh, yeah, that's terrible. I'll tell you the funniest thing I've ever seen in China. That's when so many people are trying to get on a city bus, and the last guy is in such a tight hurry that the door is locked against his ass.",disgust
He got arrested.,disgust
"If I remember, he went out with a light sentence, something like three years in a minimum security prison.",disgust

"So, Monica, what do you want to do this afternoon?",disgust
"Actually, I had a perfect plan for this afternoon, but it's totally ruined by the sandstorm. I woke up this morning and found it sunny. So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me.",disgust
"I hate sandstorms too, it can be worse than any bad weather.",disgust
That it is normal after a tense work night. Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either. Once I worked overtime every day for a whole week including the weekend.,disgust
"You know our boss is still trying to save the last penny, so we need to use the equipment first.",disgust
I just got the lashes wrapped up.,disgust
You're afraid of a eyelash buckler.,disgust
I'm putting on mascara.,disgust
I didn't pay attention to that.,disgust
Did your boss say anything to offend you at work?,disgust
Don't you think you're exaggerating a little? Calling you by nicknames should be so bad...,disgust
What do you mean?,disgust
But what?,disgust
"I don't know, there's a lot of fish out there in the sea!",disgust
I hear Jean married a business magnate.,disgust

What's going on?,disgust
How was the movie?,disgust
"How are you, Christopher?",disgust

There is a reality TV show on a group of people who are trying to lose weight.,disgust
"Hey, Paul, how are you, friend.",disgust
What do you mean?,disgust
Did you tell him about it?,disgust
What's the problem?,disgust
"Yeah, and?",disgust
Why?,disgust
I failed my final exam. What can I do now?,disgust
"Look at him, it's awfully dry.",disgust
How are you doing these days?,disgust
I won't let you fight on this campus.,disgust
Is that Anne?,disgust
"We had a good time, we laughed and talked all night last time.",disgust
"Give me a second chance, can we meet tomorrow night for a drink at the pub?",disgust
"No, the only thing I've ever done behind your back is zip you, plus I told all my other girlfriends, and my wife who's becoming a suspect, and we had a cold for a while, say,",disgust
"Haha... you're not very funny. I guess that means-- except me to tell my lover that we stopped seeing each other, too.",disgust
I'd like to make friends with her.,disgust
Is this a restaurant you want to come back to?,disgust
"You've had a long flight, you must be tired.",disgust
Why not?,disgust
"I guess you got what you're paying for, how long did you stay there?",disgust
What took you so long?,disgust
"Yes, it's really hard. But you have to believe that you will find a suitable job finally. When you work, you can accumulate a lot of experience. Besides, you have to learn a lot of things while you work.",disgust
"But whether you like it or not, there is a lifelong trend of study to make sure that we can keep up to date with the society in high development. And you have to accept this concept positively.",disgust
They asked me to go to Paris to check out the new office that has just been established.,disgust

It couldn't have been that bad. Go ahead and tell me about it.,disgust
What did you do?,disgust
"You're right, if she goes into a meeting with our clients like this, it would make our business bad, wouldn't it?",disgust
"We're on the same team here, Elvin.",disgust
"I can't do that, Zina.",disgust
Since when did Eddy start doing ballet?,disgust
He's dancing with Jack!,disgust
Wei-ya is the only time a year you can make fun of the boss.,disgust
Look who you can sit next to--Tim of the purchase!,disgust
"Did you get Bean's ten different good chances ahead, like the Dalai Lama?",disgust
"I thought I might as well send one or two of them, maybe my luck will get better.",disgust
"Just take them for your good friends and have a conversation with them as we do, make sure you don't lose your temper.",disgust
"Well, anyway, you'll get your increase when the economy starts to recover.",disgust
Is this a legitimate complaint?,disgust
You've had a busy day.,disgust
"Hi, it's Monica, I was wondering when we could work on this financial report.",disgust
"If she goes into meetings with our clients like this, it would make our company a bad idea, wouldn't it?",disgust
I guess I was paying more attention to his answers than his body language.,disgust
People talked.,disgust
"They don't really think you took it, do they?",disgust
How many were there?,disgust
Like what?,disgust
What does that have to do with the money disappearing?,disgust
